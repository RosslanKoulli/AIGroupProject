My emotions have been mainly up in the past few weeks. I believe this is because I have lived on my own for 24 years and also worked a lot from home, so the lockdown did not affect me as much as others. I am missing my family and friends but keeping in touch by Zoom and phone. The Government I believe the government, especially Boris, has done their best to cope with this extraordinary situation. There have been some mistakes but they are doing their best to correct them. Boris is very sensibly taking advice from all to assist is his decision making, unlike idiotic Trump who just bullies everybody, ignores their advice and does what he wants. The proposed steps are a slow return to work using social distancing and possibly masks trying to avoid another outbreak which seems fine to me. Using an app to assist in contact tracing etc. Hopefully, a vaccine will be found which will help and immunity will build up and by this time next year everything should be back to nearly normal….except of course the economy will be a disaster, there will be so many people unemployed and businesses in administration. News I watch the BBC News at 6pm every day to get an update of the current situation. I watch some of the daily press broadcasts at 5pm when I feel they are important, e.g. when Boris returned to work and thankfully, said he was going to continue the lockdown. I do not know of anyone who has challenges with access to the news. I find the BSL interpreters distracting but of course, were I deaf, I would love them. I am ambivalent about the use of them but can see how helpful they would be to the 11 million deaf people in the UK to know what is going on in their country and to be honest am surprised they are not used by the British Government. I know this is contradictory, but it is how I feel. L7499 Work and Home Life On the day lockdown was announced, I lost all my work. As a Virtual Assistant I work for a variety of different clients, all of whom decided to stop so my income stopped then. I had to apply for benefits for only the second time in my life (I had to when I was a single parent) but it is much easier now as you can apply online and it only took a month for it to be sorted. My home life has remained the same other than I have no work but still sit at my PC every morning as I am doing various courses and writing like now! I go for more walks as I have the time. I call my friends rather than seeing them and Zoom with my brothers. I speak to my neighbours when I see them, social distancing being easy as there is a path and lawn between us. I am also a member our village society and administer the website and Facebook page so am always adding posts to that mainly regarding Covid-19. We were going to have a Zoom AGM but a couple of the members can’t/won’t do Zoom so not sure how we will handle that! Technology As I mentioned above, I do use technology, none of it new to me as I was using it previously. I am using Zoom more and Facebook to update the village re fraud and scams as we are members of the Neighbourhood Watch scheme and they send us updates for me to post. I use Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram (a bit) WhatsApp a lot, Zoom and Facebook with ease and there have been no challenges for me. To use a phrase I like, I am technologically aware! Shopping and Food There have been challenges with this especially due to the idiotic people stockpiling for no reason. However, this seems to have settled down now. Unfortunately, I do not like going shopping because I have to be near people as the aisles are not wide enough. Our local Co-op has only recently created a one-way system and only so many in the supermarket. Our local Tesco has been doing this for a while and only allowing so many customers in at once. I am thinking that if this goes on too long, we will all become agoraphobic and not want to go out! My eating habits have mainly remained the same as I do like to cook for myself. Entertainment and Leisure I had started a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy course in January and not done much of it. Now I am concentrating on it but I am finding it quite challenging. I am also on Google Digital Garage doing some courses there. I have been writing a story about my time spent in Libya in the late seventies for years so am working on that too. might get it finished eventually… I do like documentaries so have recently watched Influenza: 1918 which was remarkably interesting, a lot like Covid but even more L7499 deadly! OJ; Made in America which I watched previously but watched again as it was so engrossing. One on Buster Keaton and others. I absolutely cannot stand shows where they are interviewing people on Zoom or similar. To me that is not a proper programme, so I avoid them. I have also gone back to learning Spanish on Duolingo and was surprised at how much I remembered as I have not done it for at least a year. Have done my usual spring clean in bits. I also play the drums sort of so go into my garage and play them (electronic so as not to disturb my neighbours) plus I have a small keyboard in my office (my grandson’s) which I play occasionally. I have also started sketching again and am planning to paint although I am rubbish at it. I am considering doing some photography but my mobile phone probably takes better images than my camera. I have also worked on the village website and my own in the hope of gaining work again once lockdown is over. Watched a lot of films, recently, The Butterfly Effect, Sleeping with Enemy, What I did on my Holidays, The Lone Ranger, Rush -all of which I had already seen but watched again because I enjoyed them. I started The Game but remembered I didn’t like it. I have recorded Notorious which is from 1946 so not sure I will be able to watch it. Downloaded BBC Sounds app but not listened to anything yet. I do use Google mini and Alexa a lot for info and the latter to play quizzes and games. I also play a lot of games on my phone, mainly word games, Scrabble, Crosswords and card games. Personal Hygiene This has remained the same other than washing my hands more thoroughly. Sleep My sleep has improved if anything as often I would go to bed with things on my mind and only sleep for 6 hours. Now I don’t really have anything to worry about so sleep for 7 hours or more! I know in reality I should be worried that I won’t get work and so on but I have decided in that case I will retire as I am 70 later this year and think I have worked enough. I have enjoyed this chance to relax and do the things I want; I feel rested and happy. I can understand, of course, the real worries for families, concern for how they are going to feed their children. There is going to be so many unemployed people once this is over and the economy is going to hell in a handcart so it is going to be a nightmare but If I have to, I will return my car, I have put myself on the housing register and I will move to a council home if necessary and manage. I rarely dream, although my daughter tells me I do dream but don’t remember them. So, I only occasionally remember a dream and they are L7499 weird and probably related to whatever is going on in my life at the time. Recently I have had none I can remember."

Female.76. Married. Teddington. Acting teacher and play director retired. Spring Directive. 2020 Part 2: Covid 19 (update) Health I have suffered various physical problems over the last months, but not due to Covid. However, the situation has obviously made the problems more difficult to deal with. At the outbreak of lockdown, I was having aqua sessions with a physiotherapist in a group at local baths for hip problems. I had 2 of the 4 sessions and then had to stop. Follow-up sessions also cancelled although I have just had a phone call from my physio who has sent extra exercises and then signed me off. Hospital appointments with the consultant have also been postponed. I have been having problems with my teeth and had even needed a special x-ray in Harley Street to try and discover the cause of the problem, but my very thorough dentist could not solve it. It did seem to recover only to worsen a few weeks ago. Of course, I did not had access to a dentist. It seems to come and go and I pay extra care to dental hygiene and hope itdoesn’t get worse as the dentistdid sayI will probably need root-canal treatment. My new spectacles are a problem as they keep slipping-off and although tightened once are now even worse. I resort to using old glasses most of the time. Recently I had a bout of cystitis which is an old problem. I was very worried about how to get treatment. I rang the surgery and after a rather unsympathetic receptionist was put on the list for a phone call. Fortunately, the GP saw the cause of my call and responded quickly and arranged for the anti­biotic prescription to be sent electronically to the pharmacy. There were no volunteers available so my husband went there and waited outside for the pharmacist to bring out the medication. I have received a message from the surgery to say there is help available for mental health problems. This is probably because I have been treated for depression and anxiety in the past. I have not called on this, although at times I have been very depressed. I was at my most depressed on the Sunday after Boris made his speech in which he outlined his plans for easing the lock-down. These plans threatened to be a disaster for my daughter and family as she is a year 1 teacher and my grandson has a heart condition. The government’s plans also seemed to me to make the situation much worse and my daughter agreed with me that we were better off with the strict rules. How can we trust a government which quite obviously doesn’t know what it is doing? I felt absolutely helpless and the next day could not function at all. I sat there unable to move or speak for some time. I still take it day to day with no image of any future. We do not go out. My long-time problem is sciatica which I have had for 50 years since I was pregnant with my eldest. It is not bad all the time but has been troubling recently. Over the years I have had treatments and the osteopath helps but I can see nobody at the moment. I also suffer from migraines, but they have been better in recent years. Perhaps the most painful condition I am dealing with is the arthritis in my hands, particularly the index finger of my right hand. This makes writing very painful if I use my lovely fountain pen and there are an increasing number ofthings I simply can’t do, opening jars, tucking-in bed-sheets and carryingthings. I drop things ifI’m not very careful. When I am stressed as I am a lot of the time at the moment it sems worse and only underlies my general helplessness. The Government. While realising that they have an impossibly difficult job I have a very low opinion of the government. I was amazed that they did not take a firmer action much earlier and seemed to be in denial. During the February half-term people flooded back from ski-ing holidays from countries already in the grip of the virus. That those countries were incredibly irresponsible in not closing their resorts is another matter. I do not intend to list all the ways in which the government and its so-called advisors failed to take suitable action. Without very clear rules people behave as they choose. Sending children and their teachers back to school at the moment is to quote the headmaster of mygrandsons’ school, “madness”. I can’t imagine what they will do in the future. I don’t want to think about it. News I read the Times and listen to radio 4 and watch the news on TV, but of late I have cut right back on this as it is not good for my mental health. I was so disgusted by leaders on schools opening in the usually fair Times that I no longer read the news sections of the paper. I did watch the briefings every day and my husband and I would shout at the TV and comment on the incredulous nature of these briefings. I said if a film is made, they will have problems with casting as nobody will want to play such boring people or say such dreadful lines. There is already a sign language interpreter on the News Channel. Work and Home Life. I am retired. I live with my husband. We have been helping with grandchildren home-schooling, particularly for H who lives in Bath. There have been some technology problems but on the whole, it works extremely well and it gives us a chance to interact with him and use our teaching skills. Technology Yes, technology while being a Godsend, does present problems. We use WhatsApp a lot, for messages, phone calls and video for home-schooling. We facetime our son in the States as we have done for years. Zoom is new and challenging. We had a very successful book group recently but we needed 3 Zooms to do it and the re-connecting can be tricky. With another book group I found the worry over re­connecting spoilt the experience rather and you feel time-controlled. I did use Zoom for a photography group and as this was professionally done there was no time pressure. However, I found the concentration required meant I ended up with a headache after each session. Others say the same. All those faces on the screen and anxieties over knowing when to speak etc. I have decided to let these particular photo classes go for the time being. I note the headmaster ofthe boys’ school says that endless Zoom sessions throughout the day are just too exhausting for pupils and not like being in class. I use Instagram as I have done for a long time and it is a way of keeping in touch, particularly with ex-students and others who I don’t generally see. I don’t use Facetime but myhusband does. It is good to see people, but lots of pictures of the places I cannot go to can be a downer. D has been asked to record a monologue for a project a director he knows is working on. I wasn’t happy withthe quality of his recording so stepped in to help. People are having to learn how to present themselves from home for all kinds of things. I am aware from Future Learn courses that I do that the eye-line is important and as he was reading a script on the PC while recording on his iPad D was always looking to heaven. I worked on this and by moving machines around and thinking about lighting and background we came up with a very good result. Shopping and Food Shopping was a real problem at the start. D spent hours and hours trying to get a supermarket slot and eventually was successful sonow wehave Sainsbury’s about every2 weeks. We had problems with our milkman, Milk and More in spite of being with them for years but that is now sorted. We are into our 2nd week of getting fruit and vegetables from Oddbox which was recommended by an ex-student and which I saw on Instagram. Years ago, we had an organic delivery and prefer organic but we couldn’t get back with them and somehow it doesn’t seem tomatter. Like allthose wretchedplastic bags it is something we have to accept. As vegetarians we eat lots of veg anyway but now we are eating more. At the start our son came over with orders for us including a veg box, but we are OK now. Neighbours also offered to help and one still asks if we need anything. We are eating very well and food is important. D is a good cook. I used not to bother with lunch but I do now. We have 3 good meals a day and snacks mid­morning and afternoon and even supper. Yes, I have put on weight. The 5/2 diet is completely ignored. Entertainment and leisure. We did try and walk at the start, but there are just too many people and joggers and dog-walkers everywhere. Occasionally we make it to the local rec, usually waiting for the rain and as it never seems to rain that isn’t often. I alsodid the exercises I was given by the physio to do in the water. No water so just up and down the garden, but I soon got bored with that. I do not enjoy exercise. Too boring. I have been doing Future Learn courses but I’ve done those for several years. I read a lot and have a jigsaw on the go and several colouring books, but none of this is new. I have always taken photographs, both with a camera and on my phone and belong to a small photography group. We had Zoom meetings recently and took photos to reflect the situation working in black and white. I was pleased with the results but I’ve opted out ofthe next project. I feel I’ve exhausted the house and garden and others are going further afield and it all just saddens me. I mean to return to my familyhistory researchbut somehow haven’t got round toit. The home-schooling is new and I enjoy it. We also made a cake which I hadn’t done in years but then I lost the diamond from my signet ring in the mix so not encouraging. My husband made banana cake, his first ever cake, but he is making another at the moment and it is not going well! We do silly quizzes with family on WhatsApp, my sister-in-law in the States and my nieces in France and Switzerland and son also in America. My eldest son has just started us on Polygon from the Times so a group of us do that. As our gardener can’t come, I do weeding and D cuts the grass, probably more often than it needs. We watch Tv and search for films and enjoy serials. Recently watched “Homeland” “KillingEve” “The AWord”, Michael Portillo’s “Great Canadian Train Journeys”and I’mlookingforward toSpring Watch. Goodness knows what the Archers will be like in its new format. (later) it’s prettydreadful andI’ve given up on it. Books since lock-down up to 23rd may. Munich. Robert Harris.

The Song of Achilles. Madelaine Miller The Left Hand of Darkness. Ursula le Guin. Circe. Madelaine Miller. Economic Diplomat. Sir Nicholas Bayne. Hardly entertainment, but important. I tune in on Sundays to the service from the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court, which I usually attend. I miss Hampton Court very much. I usually work as a volunteer andI can’t continue withthis. I miss the people, the place, the work. London has been such an important part of my life and I feel absolutely desperate at the thought of not being able to go there. I love the museums, galleries, theatres, the old buildings, the very streets. Many organisations are working hard to provide videos but it is not the same at all. Personal Hygiene No change in personal hygiene except very thorough teeth cleaning. Sleep. I have had some disturbed sleep, sometimes getting up and reading or doing my jigsaw and drinking Sleepy tea and having toast and honey. I have some herbal tablets I sometimes take. I wake up with pains in my legs and hip and sometimes rub in a cooling jell. I am finding it difficult to get up in the mornings. I have had bad dreams, particularly earlyon, but I can’t remember most of them. One dream: I am travelling on the top deck of a bus, which I never do, and I am not sure where to get off. There is someone with me. I see a bus stop and ask the person to ring the bell. I go down steps and then more steps and instead of getting off I am in a sort of room with a young woman at the counter who demands money and asks for a tip. I protest but look in my purse and get out a half-crown. (old money) and give her that and she says I have a bargain as I have two now, but I sayI don’t want another ticket. Off the bus and at one moment I am in smart streets at night and I think Notting Hill. There is nobody around and then I am back in the dream in a vast estate and I know it is a dangerous area and I am looking for a young woman who has killed someone. (this reflects “Vera” that I watched on TV last night). I have a long way to go and I think there is another bus journey and I am in the estate and searching. I wake up. In another dream, barely remembered, I am again lost and, while at first thinking I have time to spare, suddenly realise I am going to be late. I ask people the way and it is confusing. I am going to an emergency dentist, not my dentist because of lockdown. It is a woman and she says the tooth needs to come out although my dentist did not say so. I am worried and wake up. Again, travelling and trying to find somewhere. I get off the bus at the wrong stop and try to walk back but end up going round in a loop, but then I reach the main road. I am in a narrow road between high buildings. On my right a very high, red brick building with a few, tiny windows. It is like a sort of nightmare castle, very oppressive. This is where I have to go. Then I am inside and it is OK and very modern andlight. Idon’t know whyI am there."

My partner and I have both stayed physically well throughout lock-down so far. Mentally, I think we’ve also stayed fairly healthy and mentally resilient. My partner was a little wobbly at the very beginning, I think partly caused by anxiety about his parents, particularly his dad who has diabetes. But we’ve generally worked hard to create a daily structure, get on with meaningful work, and support each other. We’ve definitely felt sad about missing out on planned trips and seeing family, but that sadness has also felt quite small and muted in the face of everything else. I’ve had anxiety about things such as losing work (most of my clients are small charities and arts organisations, so the future looks quite grim for them) and whether we’ll be able to move back to the UK this summer as planned, but those worries haven’t felt insurmountable. Being able to get outside every day has also helped – we have no outdoor space, so have really welcomed the ability to still leave our home, access parks and public spaces etc. I think if I lived alone I’d be feeling much worse, mentally. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. No. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Up and down, good days and bad days. Sometimes I feel positive and purposeful, with valuable work to get on with, tasks to get done, a future to plan for etc. Some days I’ve felt hopeless and worried, and very angry about what’s happened and how it’s been handled. I worry about the long-term future, and how far back all this will put our plans -moving, starting new jobs in a new city, buying a house, having a family, looking forward to a safe and sustainable life. Everything feels uncertain and contingent at the moment, so it’s hard to plan, practically, for more than a few weeks’ ahead. I tend to try and stick to a short-term mindset, in which I can feel more positive, and in which things can still be achieved. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? In the UK, I think it has been shambolic. Vague advice, slow reactions that have cost tens of thousands of lives. It feels like the rest of the world is looking on at Britain, aghast. I think Boris Johnson and his government have behaved appallingly, and truly shown that they are the party of the few, not the many. I don’t know how anyone can justify voting for the Tories after this -their callousness, their disregard, their laziness, the sheer cruelty and greed of their steady dismantling of the welfare state, which has exacerbated this crisis to criminal levels. It absolutely sickens me. I sincerely hope this will be the death knell of Conservative government in Britain. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I think they’ll continue to flounder, shamefully and shambolically. Loosening of restrictions will be announced, and then revoked. Support schemes will be piecemeal and poorly planned. Attempts to re­start the economy will continue to punish the poorest, and the most precarious, while Boris’ friends in finance and big business will glide comfortably on, smirking as millions tumble into the abyss. I thought I could never feel more ashamed of being British than I felt after the Brexit debacle, but this is a new low. News Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I read the new online, wherever I can get it without a paywall, so mostly the BBC, the Guardian, and local newspapers. I’m also checking Twitter a lot more. I haven’t been watching the daily government briefings consistently – they make me too angry – but I do watch now and then. Of course BSL interpreters should be used, I am, depressingly, completely unsurprised that the Tory cabal has failed to do this. They lack the basic empathy necessary to consider the needs of people who don’t look or live like themselves. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. We’re lucky in that we’ve both been able to continue working, albeit in altered states – he’s a teacher and working from home and doing ‘virtual’ teaching hasn’t been particularly enjoyable for him. But it’s better than not working at all. I’ve been working from home for the past 18 months anyway (I’m a freelance development consultant), so not much of a change for me, and I’ve manged to maintain working for most of my clients, at least in the short term. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? We don’t have children, so no home schooling, thank goodness, though of course my partner has still had to ‘teach’ his class of children every day (mostly via email). Our relationship has remained strong and loving, bar a couple of silly squabbles, and we’ve supported and taken care of each other. I haven’t minded him being at home at all, even though our flat is small, we’re respectful of each other’s space. We’re both aware of how much harder this all would have been if we couldn’t be together. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I haven’t used any new technology or new platforms – but I’ve certainly been online and video calling a lot more. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? We zoom our families every week or so, and I’ve had a few calls with friends (some with people I’d only see once a year, if that), we’ve played virtual quizzes etc. I don’t love this – I find video calls a poor imitation of real conversation, and repeated calls are becoming quite boring and tiring. I much prefer normal phone/ voice calls. Twitter – yes, lots. I find it quite a miserable, back-biting platform though, I very rarely come off it feeling better than when I went on. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Initially there was a lot of panic buying and short-term shortages of things like pasta and tinned tomatoes in the Hague, but after a week or two it calmed down, and we’ve been able to shop normally, although trying to go less frequently. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Mostly the same – I make quite a big effort to eat ‘healthily’ in the week, and enjoy more treats, and alcohol, at the weekend. We order a takeaway once a week, and I’ve found myself really looking forward to that. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? Ashamed to say I haven’t really learnt any new skills! My hobbies and pastimes have stayed the same – lots of reading and writing, watching TV and films, a daily walk. We did do a jigsaw quite early in lockdown, which I enjoyed. And my partner has ordered some lego… We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We’ve watched Tiger King, along with the rest of the world. Lots of Bob’s Burgers. We’ve been on a bit of a Tom Hanks kick, film wise. Since mid-March, I’ve read: The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel (twice – I absolutely love Mantel) The British Museum is Falling Down by David Lodge What Are You Like by Anne Enright The Secret History by Donna Tartt (re-read) The Children’s Book by A.S. Byatt (re-read) An Experiment In Love by Hilary Mantel Billy Liar by Keith Waterhouse The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner by Alan Sillitoe Vacant Possession by Hilary Mantel Himself by Jess Kidd Outline by Rachel Cusk Transit by Rachel Cusk Tyll by Daniel Kehlmann, trans. Ross Benjamin Middlemarch by George Eliot So quite a lot of re-reading books I’ve enjoyed before, for comfort, as well as new material. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My hygiene habits have stayed pretty much the same. Regular showers, washing hair, wearing make-up etc. I’d feel less happy and less purposeful if I wasn’t washed and dressed each day – that would be a bit of a slippery slope. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe I’m not a very good sleeper, normally, and I always take a herbal sleep aid, but my sleep hasn’t been affected too much by lockdown. I’ve maintained a normal bedtime routine. Some more vivid dreams, but none I can remember. If I wake up in the night, I’m usually dwelling on something to do with work, rather than the wider crisis."

My husband and I both developed ‘symptoms’ of COVID in April, but were not sick enough to be tested or to require hospitalisation. On the Friday he came home from shopping for his parents-in-law in their local Sainsburys (not our usual Sainsburys) and said he thought he’d got COVID, as he was experiencing a tight chest which had suddenly come on as he left the shop, and he also had slight breathing difficulties. In line with his usual practice when ill, he went straight to bed. I took his temperature, and it was slightly up. On the Saturday morning he said his chest was better but he’d found it more difficult than usual to breathe during the night (he usually finds it harder to breathe at night because he is overweight). However, that was the worst of it – by the Sunday morning everything had returned to normal except his temperature, though he felt very tired. On the Monday he got up and worked for four hours, then returned to rest, and did the same on the Tuesday, and was able to work normally on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Two days after that, on Easter Sunday, I awoke in the early morning feeling ice-cold and I could not warm myself up. By mid-morning I was experiencing such fatigue and weakness that I couldn’t even sit up in bed, and had to watch the Zoomed church service lying down. My temperature, which is usually below normal, started to rise, and I had a headache. I couldn’t do anything other than stay in bed for the next ten days – besides the intense fatigue I also had severe muscle pains, particularly in and around the site on the left side of my chest where I had had a lump- and lymphectomy 15 years ago. (Although no cancer was found in my lymph glands, the whole set on my left was removed, and since then whenever my immune system has been fighting an infection I have experienced pain and swelling in my left arm, as the lymph fluid builds up.) These pains were the worst part of this particular sickness. Once I was able to get up again it was a further two weeks before I could manage to stay up for a whole day, and even after that I would need to spend a day in bed recovering once or twice a week for some time. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. When lockdown started I had already been in therapy for a resistant depression which had been my normal state for the past 30 years; other treatments had failed so I had self-referred to a private hospital and begun this intensive course of treatment, which was just beginning to work by the time lockdown began. I have continued my regular therapy sessions with my psychologist throughout lockdown, although they now take place remotely rather than in the hospital. This has worked very well for me, saving a very early start once a week and a lengthy journey to and from the hospital. I have also had consultations with the psychiatrist who is overseeing my treatment, again remotely using video conferencing technology. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Lockdown has been a tremendously useful period for me because it has removed many of the day to day stresses which were perpetuating the depression – physical stresses and social stresses, plus the sheer exhaustion of having to keep going. It was as if I’d been struggling to keep up with life for years and suddenly it stopped to let me catch up. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Initially my emotions were no more unstable than before lockdown, but as I began to relax properly for the first time in years I noticed that they were more stable and on a handful of occasions I have experienced very clear positive feelings such as hope. I hadn’t been able to feel anything positive for years before this. As the end of lockdown nears, however, I am noticing less stability. Sometimes I feel restless, at other times I feel very sad at the thought that this time of peace and rest is coming to an end, and I feel scared and stressed and burdened by the weight of obligations and expectations that seem about to descend upon me again. I am deeply angry that things seem to be returning to ‘normal’, and I desperately want to avoid my life returning to ‘the old normal’, because for me that was horrible. I feel as if I was just getting sorted and now it’s all about to be ripped away from me and the noise and chaos are about to engulf me again. I realise, however, that my experience is pretty much unique and for most people this has been a time of fear and loss and grief. We are comfortably off, and although our jobs are both uncertain at the moment we are in no immediate danger of long-term unemployment. Similarly, to date we have not lost anyone close to us to COVID19, indeed amongst our family and friends we hardly know anyone who is even sure they have had the virus. So we really have enjoyed very pleasant circumstances and this has obviously coloured our emotional reactions. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Introduction of lockdown – too little, too late, but glad when it finally happened. Easing of lockdown – too much, too soon, driven in part by populism. Deaths in care homes – despicable neglect, blatant ageism, chilling. Defence of Dominic Cummings – shameful. Attempt to get children back in school in June – not thought through at all. There has been an increasing reluctance to listen to the advice of the chief scientists, for which I expect the entire country to pay in terms of ongoing risks to health. However, Furlough scheme – surprisingly generous. I have now given up thinking about or engaging with political news, as I find it only upsets me and there’s nothing I can do about it. I did not vote this government in and they have not won me over by their handling of the crisis. Having said that, I doubt the Opposition, with its (then) inexperienced and autocratic leader, would have done much better – they might have made different mistakes, but they would still have been mistakes. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I really do not want to think about this. It is too distressing. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Radio 4. BBC news online. We do not have a television and we do not take a newspaper. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. We do not have a television, and if we did I would not have watched them. There are many more positive and beneficial things I can do with my time. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? No. There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? It would certainly be more inclusive, and I would welcome it on behalf of my friends who have televisions but rely on BSL. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Both my jobs initially moved to ‘working from home’. However, there were only so many ‘back office’ jobs I could do remotely for the library, as most of my role is to do with interacting with customers, so once my colleagues and I had exhausted all the jobs we could do remotely we were furloughed. My other job is office-based and I was already working from home on occasion so it has been easy to adapt and I have continued to work through the whole lockdown period. I have found working from home more efficient than working at my places of work, because home is a quiet environment and I do not have to cope with the multiple distractions of an open-plan office. However, that has meant that although I have been productive, I have also found it more tiring as I have achieved more with fewer breaks. Being on furlough has been a real blessing, freeing me to get much-needed rest and focus on my mental health. I have also appreciated not having to commute to either job. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Lockdown has been very positive for me and my husband. We have no children so have not had to worry about home schooling, or (more recently) when we feel it’s safe to let them go back to school. Similarly, we haven’t really had to worry about caring for elderly or vulnerable dependents. My parents-in-law are elderly and somewhat vulnerable, but they live about 17 miles away. They’ve been able and keen to shop for themselves (it’s the one time each week when they leave their housing estate) so we’ve only actually started seeing them again as restrictions have loosened – fortunately around the time of their birthdays, so we have met in their garden and kept 2m apart. My husband and I have enjoyed spending more time around the house and more time together. The only real adaptations we’ve had to make are around working practices: as soon as he started working from home my husband took over my study as his computer laboratory, while continuing to use his own study for church business (processing the finances etc.). This meant that I have nowhere to work when working from home, so he generously spent some of his profits on a corner desk for our bedroom, which has become my new work area. I’m very contented with this, as it’s a very nice piece of furniture, and our room is my favourite room in the house, being cool and light and comfortable. We’ve also had to make an effort to synchronise our breaks and mealtimes, as we were starting to drift out of sync and never really sit down together, despite living in the same house. My husband likes to listen to the news on the radio at mealtimes, so we have come to an arrangement whereby I set my alarm for 1245 and 1745 Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist each day and we get to the kitchen as soon as we can after that, with the aim of sitting down to eat together by the time of the weather forecast (shortly before the hour, at which time the news is read). Similarly, if one of us decides to take a break the other will usually stop what they’re doing and join in. This was initially hard for me, as I’m used to my breaks being at set times and for a maximum of 15 minutes, but I’ve learnt to be more flexible when working from home. We have both enjoyed being able to spend more time with our dog and our cat, and I have made an effort to teach our (rather elderly) dog some simple games and give her special times of petting. Our cat joined the family about a month before the lockdown, so it has been very good to spend so much time around the house bonding with her, and she is now a very friendly cat who actively seeks me out and demonstrates her affection for me. This is very rewarding! We have several vulnerable friends who have been shielding, so we have made an effort to phone them once or twice a week or more (as with my in-laws). Our friendships have thus become slightly more intentional as we would usually see these friends in the normal course of the week and now we have to make the effort to remember them and set aside time for longer telephone conversations, but the relationships haven’t changed all that much. Some friendships have perforce been put on hold – in all but one case this has come as a relief to me, as it is one less source of stress and frustration and worry – and I am looking for new ways to manage the number of demanding friends I have, and to be more selective in future choices of friends when lockdown lifts. I have kept in touch with a few special friends through emails and/or Facebook Messenger, and I have developed one new friendship (with someone I knew of but had never really talked to) and rekindled two old ones – the latter as a result of reading their posts on Facebook and realising they were in need of encouragement and/or support. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience of this? Before lockdown I was already au fait with IT communications, so emailing and Skyping were no problem. I soon added Zoom to my repertoire, as most of the meetings I needed to attend were using Zoom rather than Skype. It was surprisingly easy to adapt to having my psychology/therapy sessions using online facilities – in fact it has suited me rather better than going to the hospital for them, as it has dispensed with the 2-hour round trip this used to involve. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? The job from which I have been furloughed uses MS Teams to keep working (senior) and furloughed (junior) members in touch with each other. Initially this worked well, but as the terms of our furlough mean that we must not respond to emails coming into the account which is linked to MS Teams the incentive to log on simply to check Teams has decreased and those of us not currently working hardly ever seem to post on it. I haven’t used Zoom or any other e-conferencing software to keep in touch with friends individually – I think most of my friends are more comfortable with written communications than ‘live’ online ones. We offered my parents-in-law help setting up What’s App so that we could all see each other and spend time together, but they refused; my mother-in-law prefers telephone, text and email communications and my father-in-law distrusts/can’t be bothered with computers and will rarely spend time on the phone due to difficulties with his hearing. Both of them immensely prefer ‘in person’ visits and are prepared to wait for them to become possible and regular again. I have kept in touch with a few special friends through emails and/or Facebook Messenger. I have developed one new friendship (with someone I knew of but had never really talked to) and rekindled two old ones – all three as the result of reading their Facebook posts. One was offering support and two were in need of support at the time. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have occasionally used Facebook to escape from current events, but it is hard to avoid posts referring to them, and I find Facebook quite stressful anyway; it feels as if I’m being bombarded by (mostly useless) information delivered too loudly. Having said that, I am very aware that when I feel frustrated I spend too much time aimlessly scrolling through Facebook, and this is neither a feel-good activity, nor a productive one. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? For most of lockdown I haven’t been further than our local Spar, where I’ve been pleased to find some things that were unavailable in the main supermarkets. The first time I went to Waitrose again I lost the plot and instead of buying lots of sensible everyday food I hoovered up lots and lots of the reduced-price chocolate left over from Easter. I really felt quite dizzy with the freedom of being able to go to a big supermarket again and the amount and variety of choice available for each product type was mind-boggling! My husband has done the regular supermarket shopping, and instead of visiting various different supermarkets, has stuck to Sainsburys, and used our local one every time. Normally I would visit Tesco when I was in town for work, and we would go to our local Sainsburys whenever we needed a big shop. On average he has made 1-2 visits to Sainsburys each week. At the start of lockdown we decided not to stockpile, as we felt it was selfish and should be unnecessary if the supply chains continued to operate as they should. However, on my last afternoon in work he came to pick me up and visited a Chinese supermarket on the way home, where he bought 3 trade-size boxes of noodles. He has eaten a packet most days since then, and there are still plenty left. (Originally these were for use in emergencies, but we soon realised that there were way more noodles than there could possibly be emergencies!) Similarly, on that day I visited a delicatessen near work and bought six small bars of my favourite chocolate. That was as near as we came to stockpiling as such, though we did try to keep two of every ‘staple’ in our cupboard whenever possible, and aimed to have enough food in the house at any given moment to be able to sustain us for 7-10 days, in case both of us had COVID so neither could shop for a week or more. We experienced the same difficulties as other people in our area – first, the shortage of toilet paper (we had just bought a 4 pack before lockdown and fortunately this lasted us through the shortage), then eggs (we thought we’d manage to avoid this as we already had regular deliveries of local free range eggs from the milkman, but there was a handful of mornings when we received a note saying he couldn’t get any, and a couple of days when we had normal, rather than free range, eggs), then flour (as other people also caught the home cooking bug) and refried beans (great to keep in the cupboard and very good for diets) and, finally, Quorn products (presumably new converts to vegetarianism/veganism were catching on to the good stuff by then). We didn’t manage to get any hand sanitiser for the first few weeks of lockdown, but my parents-in-law, who live 17 miles from us, found their local shops got supplies before ours did, so provided us with our first two bottles. Our local Spar had hand sanitiser and facemasks long before any of the large supermarkets in our area did. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist A year before the lockdown I reached my target weight with Slimming World, and I maintained this successfully by continuing to follow their ‘food combining’ guidance for at least two meals out of three each day. The restrictions of lockdown have made this more of a challenge, but I have succeeded by dint of restricting my choice of meals down to a few tried and trusted staples, for which ingredients are relatively easy to get hold of locally, each of which I have once or twice a week, where before lockdown I would experiment more with Slimming World ready-meals and/or recipes. I have continued to have salad with lunch and supper each day, and to snack mainly on fresh fruit. This has meant that we have had to shop a little more often than we would have liked to during lockdown, but it has meant that we are eating a high quantity of fresh fruit and vegetables. Before lockdown we ate out on average once a week, and treated ourselves to Marks & Spencer calorie-counted ready meals about once a week. During lockdown we have completely stopped eating out, and have only made occasional trips to Marks & Spencers for ready meals (and other treats). One of the few things I have actively missed during lockdown has been going to coffee shops for coffee and (sometimes) a chat with friends. This was my regular treat while I was travelling to work, and for obvious reasons has now stopped. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? I started off really well with exercise in lockdown, given that I hadn’t done any since breaking my ankle 18 months earlier, although as a non-driver and a dog-owner it was normal for me to walk on average about 2 miles each day. Having heard that physical fitness could increase the chances of surviving Coronavirus I decided to start exercising again, and removed the clothes from our cross-trainer, which had been doubling as a wardrobe since the last time we had an indoor exercise fad. I found I could just about manage 5 minutes on it, and my first target was to be able to complete 10 minutes without a break. I achieved this after about a fortnight of exercise sessions every other day, and was moving towards 15 minutes non-stop when I went down with ‘symptoms of Coronavirus’. As I had a fairly straightforward, if long, recovery process I’m inclined to think that my gentle start at getting fit did help, but since then I’ve got out of the habit, and my only exercise is our daily walk with our elderly dog, who can only manage to keep going for 20-30 minutes at a gentle pace. I think some of the problem is the residual lethargy and feeling of nausea which I haven’t completely shaken off since being ill, but I’m also finding it hard to motivate myself at present, and easy to make excuses and find things I’d rather be doing! If exercise hasn’t kept me occupied, what has? As soon as I heard that the church at which I am Organist was moving to online-only services which would focus more on contemporary worship music than hymns I made the decision not to take a sabbatical from playing the organ, but rather to use the time for learning new repertoire that I would enjoy. There are two pieces of the usual repertoire of a wedding organist that I haven’t yet had the opportunity to learn, so I have started on the easier of the two, ‘The Entry of the Queen of Sheba’ from Handel’s oratorio ‘Solomon’. This is being quite time-consuming, as I’ve been unable to find a version I like either in hard copy or online so I’ve had to create my own arrangement (basically a mash-up of several other versions, none of which was exactly what I wanted) as well as learning the actual dots on the page. I’ve nearly got the arrangement completed, and have learned the notes of all the sections apart from the ones I’m still arranging. Once the arrangement is finished and I’ve got all the notes under my fingers I’ll still have to increase the speed and work on interpretation, so there’s plenty to keep me busy yet. In terms of new skills, need has forced me to become familiar with using Zoom, and various video recording and editing software. I’ve also started an online course in Jazz Piano offered (free) by FutureLearn, though this is a fairly recent development and I doubt I’ll persist beyond the first module. Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? I’m not into DIY at the best of times, and lockdown hasn’t changed that for me. However, my husband got quite into doing things around the house in the early weeks of the lockdown, and completed a number of the niggly little jobs that he didn’t have time for when he had to travel to work. As well as clearing out and Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist cleaning his study he has given away a spare computer desk, brought the wifi into our bedroom, mended the front door bell and rehung the airing rack in the sun room. We’ve looked at some of the bigger jobs that we’ll need to get people in to do for us – tarmacking the front yard and driveway, repainting the front door and window frames and re-roofing the sun room – but as yet we haven’t decided which is the top priority (they’ve all been urgent for a while now!) and, as neither of our main jobs is as secure as they were we don’t want to commit to the expense at the moment either, so project House Improvement has stalled for now. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We have been watching old episodes of ‘Dad’s Army’ (on the computer), which I am finding very comforting in this uncertain and anxious time. It does me good to see something as terrible as the 2nd World War treated with gentle humour, and I feel encouraged by the mix of the everyday trivia and the raw courage exhibited by the hapless volunteers. I also enjoy the period detail of the sets. We are currently watching the televised version of ‘Wolf Hall’, again through the computer. A friend has introduced me to the NY Metropolitan Opera nightly streaming and on-demand services lately, and so far I have seen ‘The Marriage of Figaro’ (Mozart), Akhnaten (Glass) and Satyagraha (Glass) through this medium – operas I would never be able to afford either the time or the tickets to go and see ‘live’. I am hoping to watch ‘Wozzek’ (Berg) this week. I have enjoyed re-reading some old favourites – especially the Daisy Dalrymple mysteries by Carola Dunn (mainly through Audible audiobooks) and the four books of E.M. Delafield’s ‘Diary of a Provincial Lady’. I have also read some books for the first time, including the entire ‘Wolf Hall’ series by Hilary Mantel, the entire series (to date) of Lord James Hamilton mysteries by Lynn Florkievicz (through Kindle) and three books that I was given (at my request) for Christmas: ‘Why do Shepherds need a Bush?’ (David Hilliam), ‘Sussex, Kent and Surrey 1939’ (Richard Wyndham), and ‘Lost England, 1870-1930’ (Philip Davies). The last of these has become my ‘go to’ feel-good book, mainly because its splendidly atmospheric reproductions of old photographs make me imagine what it was like living in a different time and place. In order to sustain my spiritual life I have continued reading part of the Bible most days, and have enjoyed reading ‘Every Job a Parable’ (John van Sloten) and ‘The Introvert Charismatic’ (Mark Tanner). I have also taken out a trial subscription to ‘The Church Times’, as I find the articles bring an element of challenge and growth to my devotional life. I have used the mobile phone app ‘The Bible’ to follow several series of Bible studies by various (mainly American) authors, and I have also benefited greatly from watching the daily podcast by Bishop Andrew Rumsey, ‘Going to Ground’, which (sadly) has just finished, having reached 100 episodes. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Before lockdown I would have a very hot bath every night, but since lockdown began I have noticed that I am bathing much less frequently, and showering roughly every other day. Personal cleanliness was, and still is, very important to me, and I have wondered why my habits have changed. I think it’s partly a seasonal thing – during the hot weather in the spring the idea of a hot bath wasn’t so appealing – and partly to do with my lack of stress now I don’t go out to work: a very hot bath was part of my de-stressing night-time ritual when I was commuting to and from work, but now I don’t feel in need of this comforting evening habit as I am much less stressed at the end of most days. I still wash my hair once or twice a week, as I did before, but obviously I haven’t been able to get it cut since early March. This hasn’t been too much of a problem, as I was planning to grow it down from a short bob, and I have been able to cut my fringe myself with reasonable success (for a first time!). Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? I have experienced some difficulties sleeping, but no more than I would have normally, as the regime of anti-depressants I was prescribed long before lockdown has side effects which include disturbed sleep. I have dealt with these difficulties as I usually do, by listening to talking books or getting up and doing puzzles until I feel sleepy. Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I have had no COVID related dreams, so far as I can remember, but I have had quite vivid nightmares set in my school or university days, in which people in authority (teachers, bosses from previous jobs, baddies from films I have watched) are chasing me with the intention of harming me in some way – usually raping or killing me, or both. I have been in desperate flight when I have woken up. Sometimes I have cried out in my sleep and my husband has had to wake me and reassure me."

I had to drive to the urgent treatment centre in the nearest hospital in order to have it extracted. The ‘operation’ took aminute and I waited onlyfive minutes. But it was alittle unnerving tomix with people for the first time for weeks even though there were relatively few day patients around. My underlying conditions – low level diabetes, risk of heart atrial fibrillation, tendency to high blood pressure and mild COPD are largely managed with medication. During the crisis, however, I have been told by my GP practice not to attend the surgery for routine appointments or monitoring tests which have been placed on hold until the lockdown ends. My one current problem is the sudden deterioration in my hearing which makes conversation and, especially, using the phone all the more difficult – and increases the sense of isolation. Just before the lockdown, I planned appointments to have this seen to but now I have to wait until normality returns. My emotions vary. Being almost totally isolated, as instructed by the NHS, due to age and underlying medical conditions, does, inevitably, induce feelings of loneliness and anxiety and sometimes lethargy. Most of the time I manage to cope by keeping busy or diverted and keeping in touch with family and friends by email and text etc. My emotions are, though, still affected by grief over the death of my wife of 50 years about three years ago. The sense of her absence makes isolation all the harder to live with. If we were still together, we would have found isolation much easier, even though we might have worried about each other, other people and the state of the world. We could have found enjoyment in doing things together and just securityin each other’s presence. Enjoyment and joy – very much in short supply these days. Increasing age doesn’t help either. I suppose this all amounts to a mild form of depression but at least I know why that is – it is not an inherent condition. And it helps a little to know that I am isolating to keep myself as safe as possible and to help protect others. Iamdoing ‘my bit’. I was made doubly aware recently of the seriousness of Covid-19 and the danger it poses when for some reason (possibly stress caused by technology) I suddenly felt hot and feared for a moment thought it could be the virus. Thankfully, when I checked mytemperature with aforehead thermometer, Ilearned that it was normal. Maybeit was nature’s way of reminding me to stay indoors. The Government It seems strange how a small news report about a virus outbreak in one part of a large country thousands of miles away (in January I think) has suddenly taken over and threatened and disrupted our lives. It seems that is often the unexpected dangers, the ones from the blind side, that cause the most harm. Certainly, the government didn’t see this one coming. During the early period when the virus began to spread, the government was still obsessed with leaving the European Community (‘Getting Brexit done’) and were late in the dayin taking action. The crisis has brought brough problems which would be almost insurmountable for any government but the present Tory administration could have done and could still do much better. We have not been well served, compared with other countries like Germany and South Korea. It is difficult to know where to start. I suppose with the fact that a wiser prime minister than a narcissist who thought that it was enough to sound like Churchill, instead of acting like him, would have chosen a more talented and less subservient cabinet. A better government would have coordinated public information more tightly so that the vital information it gave out was more consistent and less confusing. And an over reliance on saying that they are led by the science brushes over the fact that, as is necessary, scientists do not always agree with each other. Praising the NHS every five minutes is no substitute for acting effectively and in a timely fashion and presenting care workers with a badge is insulting when they are among those most at risk and up to now the least protected. Other concerns are: . A contingency planning exercise in 2017 seems to have largely been ignored which has prevented adequate stockpiling of medical supplies and personal protection. . The plight of residents and staff in care homes, especially vulnerable, has been virtually ignored until recently resulting in a high death rate which could have been prevented. . Anearlybeliefin the theoryof ‘herd immunity’ (allowing less vulnerable people to be infected and to mix so that they helped spread immunity) delayed the onset of social distancing measures, lagging behind other countries. . An inability to initiate testing for the virus early enough. . Confusion and inconsistency in the selection of ‘vulnerable’ people for ‘shielded’ isolation (as I am when I know older people than me with more serious conditions have not been selected) . The earlier cuts to health and social care funding of previous Tory administrations. As a result, the UK has recorded the highest total death rate in Europe (as I write we have just topped 30,000) and almost in the world. And, the UK economy and all local communities will suffer all the more damage. I think the government has now realised what is at stake and is probably acting in a more coherent and cautious manner. They have to find a way to balance managing the social distancing policy with the desperate need to re-start the economy. Relaxing the former too soon could risk the spread of the virus starting up again, forcing a second lockdown. But delaying economic regeneration too long could do even greater damage to the long term economic and social fabric of the country than it has already done. And if course, continue to increase the huge cost of supporting business and workers and the enormous public financial debt. It will not have helped to have left the European Community, of course – international cooperation has never been more needed. Now the government has their eye on the ball at last, I think (or maybe hope) that they will manage to restore normality gradually, using sound information and advice. News I read The Guardian daily – as I have done for 60 years and often monitor the news on the various news websites on my i-phone. In addition, I watch BBC News bulletins and their news channel almost obsessively. It is depressing but not so depressing and anger inducing as the daily TV news briefings on BBC TV which do little but to demonstrate the inadequacies of a singularly weak set of cabinet ministers. Most of what is said by government representatives is little more than cliché and waffle, learned by rote almost. The useful element is usually the contribution of scientific and medical advisors and their visual aids. I know no-one who has trouble accessing the news but many who don’t watch the news because they feel it is too depressing. Having hearing impairment, I always use the subtitles and I find that adequate. I am not sure if signing is also essential but have an open mind. Work and Home Life Being long retired I don’t, of course, work but before the lockdown I spent a good deal of time as a volunteer: as a befriender to vulnerable people and as a trustee and secretary of a small charity. The befriending is suspended. I am still doing a little work for the charity with writing and editing policy documents and promotional literature and will be joining meetings via video conferencing (Zoom). Much of the work and information is conveyed by email. Home life has changed a good deal in that all life is confined to the home: no visits to friends and family, no outside walks, reliance for exercise on an exercise bike, no pub visits (though those were infrequent anyway), more watching TV, a little more reading. My world has shrunk. One significant change has been the evolution of a strict daily routine to get me through the day, based on meals, writing, emailing people, exercise and treats (tea and biscuits, coffee, wine). One problem which I know is common to a lot of people in isolation, is not knowing what day it is. To solve that I have just bought a digital clock which displays time, date, and day. Technology Before the lockdown, I was already using a variety of online technology: email, text, WhatsApp, and Instagram (the latter only for sharing photos with family members). I do not (and still do not use) Facebook, Twitter etc. A distant friend uses WhatsApp for a weekly video call but I have not yet attempted to find out how to use that. I am having to learn to use Zoom for the charity but have found it difficult so far – I am getting to my limit in learning new technology. It does not come naturally! Shopping and Food My daughter has been very helpful and brings me small amounts of food and other essentials (I originally moved to live near her but never imagined quite how useful that would be). And several friends have offered to get me things. But for most food I use the Iceland delivery service online. I do though have great trouble in finding available delivery slots. I am told that the time to do this is at or after midnight but that so far has been a step too far. I have never managed to find a Tesco delivery slot. Many local shops now deliver but have limited resources. If all fails, my daughter will add to her normal weekly shop for me. She has one of my bank cards to use or for cash. But I have a full freezer and most of the time a reasonably full food covered. I have had to learn how to plan my needs a week or two ahead. My cooking has not changed a good deal. I am vegetarian (with occasional fish and chips). I am not a keen cook and no longer use recipes though I have learned some basics from my late wife who was a superb veggie cook. For about three or four days’evening meals I make a large pan of pasta sauce or other mixture of vegetables, meat substitute (eg Quorn) with herbs etc and make it last with variations – eg with pasta, rice, potatoes. This saves time and trouble. Breakfast and lunch are still pretty minimal if healthy. I know that is all the wrong way round (breakfast should be larger, tea smaller) but habits stay fixed after many years. Entertainment and Leisure This area has taken the biggest hit, not necessarily because of the lockdown but since my bereavement. I have not felt able to do anything new – I have dabbled in many things in the past and most,thanks to mypermanent state of ‘aloneness’, I no longer have the motivation to attempt: poetry writing, painting and drawing. I do write in a notebook – ideas for poems which never come about or observations and, of course, Mass Observation writing which has been helpful in giving my writing a purpose. One new activity is entering writing and photography competitions, many for the over 70s in isolation. Photography is now limited by having to stay indoors, though I still take phone photos of skies and interior images and now and then have the chance to photograph birds in the adjacent trees. But I have always done that. DIY is now unnecessary: there are things in the flat I could improve but I can live without them – ‘its only me’. Ss already noted I try to stick to a session on my exercise bike every day now with some floor exercises – this as a substitute for daily walking around town. Myabilityto concentrate is now limited, even affecting myTV watching: if a programme doesn’t grip my attention then I’m off channel hopping, looking for something better or, like a teenager, looking at news or You Tube on my i-phone. But there are times when a programme holds me. One recent example which I have seen through twice is a new serial drama about the on/off love affair between two teenagers / students set in Ireland. SallyRooney’s ‘NormalPeople’ (adapted from her novel) has received critical acclaim and I can see why. The acting and direction and spare script are remarkable and sometimes almost make the viewer hold their breath. If this is still available in fifty years’ time, it maywell be a classic. I watched it twice in quick succession using the BBC iplayer catch up service on the digital TV. There are few programmes of that quality and the virus crisis has caused the creation of many new programmes to be suspended, meaning more repeats for the next year or so. Already I am seeking out older programmes but there is, frankly, a lot of dross to wade through to find the odd gem. Currently, as well was the BBC i-player, I have access to Netflix, More Four (Channel Four archive), ITV Hub and Amazon Prime. But most of what is on offer does not appeal. I have noticed that, during isolation, I am instinctively drawn less to crime dramas and more towards family dramas, even comedies – ‘people stories’, seemingly a kind ofsubstitute for meeting real people in the flesh. And subtitles are essential to catch all the dialogue. I do read a little more than I did before isolation, preferably sitting outside in the sun, though I often fall asleep! Day time reading is non-fiction: history, politics, biography, art etc. Friends have lent me books and I have returned the favour. I read novels, mainly on my Kindle e-reader in bed before trying to sleep. I can become lost in them. I have been reading a lot of books about bereavement – somehow this helps, especially in isolation, but reminding me that I am not alone in my experience ofgrief: one impressive novelin these lines is Sebastian Barry’s ‘Secret Scripture’, set in Ireland and centred on a 100 year-old woman in a mental hospital and the hospital director who has recently lost his wife. It reflects many of my feelings and experiences in losing my wife. Grief has become a fascinating subject recently. I no longer listen to radio since my hearing impairment makes this too much of a strain. Personal Hygiene In the light of health advice, I have been washing my hands more often and for longer. As a result the skin on my hands has aged, dry and creased! I now use a barrier cream to try to offset this. Just before the lockdown started, a friend advised me to get a haircut before it was too late. I managed this with a day or two to spare. It should last me another month at least – I try to keep it a little trim using an electric shaver. But I do not want to cut any more drastically than that. So, if I emerge from isolation with shoulder length hair, so be it. I have thought of growing a beard. I wore one for most of my working years and shaved it off, at mywife’s insistence when I retired, asymbolof a new life. But electric shaving is no trouble and is an entrenched habit so at present I will stick with the status quo. Sleep I have had sleep problems for several years – mainly waking up two or three times a night needing the toilet, as a result of an enlarged prostate. Bereavement has made this a little worse. And my hearing impairment makes listening to the radio with earphones, which used to help send me off again, less effective. There has been little difference in isolation – I can normally get between six and eight hours sleep (in instalments). I have recently developed a routine to help go to sleep initially – to read, then relax and then run through in my mind the events and activity of the previous day and what I need or want to do the following day. I tend to go to bed later now and sometimes I do sleep or doze late – with no incentive to get up. But I think most of this is common to a lot of people. I rarely remember dreams. Those I do recall – waking up in the middle -often feature my wife as if all is as it was. She is sometimes warning me about something or telling me something. So far, no nightmares though. But I have had such dreams ever since she died. Isolation has made little if any difference."

REGARDING COVID 19 IMPACT ON MY LIFE IN 2020. This covers the period 4/5/20-1/6/20. I am 53 years old female living in ,a very small village in Saddleworth. . Married but chooseto live separately from my wife for most of the week. Retired Detective Police of.cer. HEALTH. When this .rst started late December/early January I had seen the news from China. I had neverheard of Wuhan. I wrongly,and maybe sel.shly assumed it would not affect me. The SARS virus was an Asian problem . We had booked a road and train trip in the USA to celebrate my wife,s 60th and in the lead up to our departure there was no direction to NOT travel. I think the day before we left there had been 1 UK death and they were quarantining anyone who came back from cruiseships. So we went away feeling it would be ok but we were hand washing more and had sanitiserwith us. Whilst in the USA over the next 10 days things deteriorated globally . The World Health Organisation declared a pandemic . I became most concerned when the idiot President Trump said he was stopping all European .ights.Two days later when he said he was thinking about stopping UK .ights we booked urgent .ights home using American airlines. It cost us £760 which we gladly paid. Online British airways wanted £3000. ! I have never been so glad to arrive in Manchester on the full plane from Philadelphia. Whilst wewere in the air American airlines announced it was stopping ALL of its long haul .ights.In my head I thought if there was a time I was going to catch Covid it would be on that full plane.For the next two weeks I was worried and relieved when I remained well. I am usually healthy and have always been strong. Rarely at the doctors. I had a hysterectomy 7years ago after suffering for years and years with painful and very heavy periods. Since then I have been really good. For the last year or so I think I am in the menopause having hot .ushes mostly atnight.My wife has a rare condition Ehler dans syndrome. She has a faulty heart valve,her joints dislocateeasily and she bruises badly easily. She is asthmatic and has a thyroid condition so she would be classed as having underlying health conditions. Since we returned she was advised to isolate andwork from home for 12 weeks. She was relieved and so was I as being at home she is safe. A few of my friends or their families have been ill with what sound like covid symptoms but have not been tested and have reported feeling really rough at home.My sister in law (oldest brothers .rst wife ) is a nurse in a general practice in Surrey. She has been tested positive and told me she felt rough ,acheing .tired and lost her sense of smell and taste inthe .rst 10 days . Then she said she felt better and was talking about returning to work. Her second week she said she felt really poorly with it and it had wiped her out. She remained at home.I have been worried for her. As for my emotions since this started. It has been frightening . Things just seem to have gone crazy in a short few weeks. The massive death toll rising on the news has made me feel fearful for our lives. My wife and I have had a frank discussion about our wishes if we got ill. What we wantfor resuscitation or ventilation. Also what if one of us dies and that we would want the other to be happy in the future. We both already had wills made and I have had a funeral plan in place for years. The fact that we feel the need to say these things to each other demonstrates how bad things are.I have felt generally worried and that things are out of my control and the govt,s control.In my life I think the .rst other time I felt like society was losing control was the .nancial crash of2008 . I was really shocked when banks were talking about not letting people have their ownmoney. Perhaps naively I thought that could never happen. I was also on duty when the riots were happening and petrol bombs were being thrown at Police . Now it makes me feel how fragile ourworld really is. I have felt tearful more than usual but I am normally emotional and cry at the slightest sentimentalthing anyway. Now anything about the NHS makes me .ll up. I have felt proud and emotional during the weekly clap for carers .I have written Thank you NHS on my England .ag from the rugby. Each Thursday at 8pm I have stood on my front doorstep and either side of me my neighbours have been there. All across the small valley you can hear clapping,people banging pans ,.reworks and the church bell on the hill just above my home rings.There are two horses living in the .eld on the opposite side of the road to my house. They have got excited each week and gallop about almost as if they are joining in.I have had a lump in my throat each time.My neighbours and I have all agreed that it makes us feel connected and gives us some strength.Then when you see the TV coverage all over the country it is amazing how many people take part.The sense of we are all .ghting this together is palpable to me. I am not generally prone to feeling depressed and would only feel down about a speci.c issue for ashort time and am glad that it is not something I suffer from. During this I have felt a sort of sadness about it all ,not a massive percentage of my thoughts but like wearing heavy boots if thatmakes any sense.My biggest fear is my wife getting ill and then me so I have felt scared for us.To combat that we have decided our plan is we both isolate in our separate homes. I am making sure I am not taking risks with contact with anyone so I can see my wife ,we have agreed every 3weeks. We need to maintain our relationship and support each other and although it feels too long and we miss each other its a safe option. My wife is an only child and her 89 year old mum has dementia. She lives alone in Wales and before this we would travel most weekends to see her,do her shopping and make her a lunch.So since lockdown so far we have been there twice. We have worn masks and gloves and kept her away from us in her lounge. She has 3 care visits a day so they and she may be a risk to us.We have done the quickest restock shop and fridge/freezer re.ll and then left .We cant just abandon her and she doesn't really grasp what is going on.I have felt worried about how we manage her and keep ourselves safe. GOVERNMENT. I voted Tory in the last election. Mainly because I detested Corbyn the now former Labour leader. My brother was a soldier and blown up by a vehicle bomb in the 70,s. He survived but severalpeople including women and kids did not. As a result I loathe the support given to the IRA by CORBYN and would never vote for them with him in charge.The lib democrats lost the plot as well so it was the best of a bad bunch.Boris JOHNSON is ,in my opinion a rich,privileged,womanising bluffer but he is the Prime minister.I was mostly just relieved they had a majority and could get something done,anything ,done afterthree years of the hamster wheel around Brexit. So my view of how they have done is mixed.On the economy help and furloughs the previously unknown Mr Sunak seems to have done reallywell. To be supporting so many people is unprecedented. I dread to think how we pay it all back though.Building the nightingale hospitals was impressive but I hope they won't be white elephant projectsin the end . I like that the daily brie.ngs happen so we can be informed but they are a depressing subject.I am reassured by Professor Witty. He looks like a real bof.n with his big forehead and geeky dress sense. He comes across as honest and well informed. I am not impressed with the PPE issues. Surely in late January they could anticipate they weregoing to need loads and should have been ordering anything and everything. Then saying they were waiting for delayed .ights from Turkey. We have a Royal air force . They should have been .ying lots of supply .ights using them.then they were slow to accept the offer of British .rms making it. Going forward they should ensure the contracts go to British companies as a priority.Testing is also an issue. I wish they'd just be honest and say we have managed X amount and we are really trying to increase and will let you know instead of bullshit about aspirational targets andcapacity .I am really keen for an antibody test to be available. I am very curious to know if I haveany as I have not felt ill. I think the biggest failure is going to be care homes. I think they should have focused 2/3 of efforts to frontline NHS and 1/3 to care homes. But they didn't and in the end I think the .gures will showthousands of old people dead. A lost generation .I think they were reluctant to step in because the care homes tend to be privately owned. It shouldnot matter. a health emergency is in place.I predict this will be their biggest weakness in how they responded. Sadly.They should have also closed our borders. We are an island and should use that to our advantage but we have not done so. Next steps. I think they will have to ease the lockdown to get the economy going again. They cant pay furlough for 1/4 of the UK workforce for too long.I think they will start mid may with maybe garden centres,recycling,building sites and then earlyJune limited schools.Football behind closed doors. I think older people are in lockdown for many many months.I wouldn't be surprised if they aim for some sort of Christmas pub easing .Travel next summer. Boris JOHNSON,s announcement 10/5/20 was a change in message from Stay home to stay alert.I think myself and many others found it confusing . The intention is to start getting people back to work. I think they are also relying on the common sense of the public. That scares me. After a long career dealing with the general public I have seen many times that a proportion of society haveabsolutely no common sense or regard for others. Whilst the lockdown has been on there havebeen numerous examples of police of.cers being spat at or bitten deliberately. There have also been lots of examples of people defying the rules. They can't deal with the word NO and will not obey,even if it is necessary to preserve lives as they have a sel.sh view of life and do whatever they want to do.I also think it makes things harder that there are different restrictions and messages in Wales,Scotland and England. We travel regularly in normal times to Wales to look after my mother in law so different rules to follow is an issue.I also think Nicola Sturgeon and the Welsh assembly are playing some power politics in it which is wrong in my opinion. I also wonder if China is going to suffer any consequences in the future. Will they pay any compensation or will they be forced to clean up their markets ?The misinformation campaign has already started and they seem to be trying to deny that itoriginated there and blaming the Americans. NEWS. I normally follow the news closely. Now it is such a looming presence. It feels like a constant bad news day . The death toll numbers are so bad. I trained as family liaison of.cer to assist bereaved families in murders and natural disasters ,the scale of that loss and its impact is just too enormousto contemplate.People not being able to say goodbye or attend funerals will have a bad effect in the future.I think a tsunami of PTSD is inevitable for NHS and frontline staff in the coming years.I look at BBC news online and have been watching the daily brie.ng on BBC . I also watch skynews in the day. The brie.ngs are a good thing but a tough watch. I sort of brace myself for the numbers every day.Some ministers are better than others. I .nd GOVE very pompous and waf.es a lot.Dominic Raab comes across fairly well and Matt Hancock but at times it is obvious they are justrepeating the script especially around PPE problems.My favourite is Professor Witty who is very reassuring for some reason.I also see social media like Facebook but I take that with a pinch of salt.I discuss events in other countries where my friends live for their perspective too. I saw the petition for BSL interpreter like the Scottish brie.ngs. I,m not sure why London don't think they should have them. Deaf people should get the brie.ng too. As long as it isn't that guy who did the Nelson Mandela funeral in South Africa…he was hilarious but soo wrong just making it up as he went along. I was really shocked by the news that Boris JOHNSON was in ICU. I may not agree with hisbehaviour at times but I did not want him to die. It made it feel like we were even more out of control. I was relieved and glad when he came out of hospital and back to work. As for the statistics. The phrase “ Lies,damn lies and statistics “ springs to mind. I cannot believe that China has had as few as 3000 deaths as it claims and as of 5/5/20 we havehad 30000 deaths in the UK. How can we have 10% of the worlds deaths ? I think our govt made an error in initially only releasing deaths of con.rmed deaths in hospitals .Under pressure they have eventually after 6 weeks started releasing them in all settings but theseare test con.rmed or suspected on death certi.cates. They are not testing every dead person so we will never really know the true .gure here or elsewhere in the world. WORK AND HOME LIFE. Being retired I am not working. I was also not willing to return to work following the recent requestsince the crisis. Mainly because in my latter years I felt the Police Organisation did not care aboutthe staff,especially in welfare around burn out or stress. In addition during my service 3 of my close colleagues were shot dead in 2 different incidents. This was a traumatic experience and took a toll on me . They said if staff returned our pensions would be stopped and we would be paid a basic hourly rate . More reasons why I was unwilling to be cannon fodder . So lockdown has changed my routine in that normally I would be busy going to the cinema ormeeting friends for lunch/coffee/meals etc. Sometimes I take the camper van away midweek to the lake district or wherever for a couple of days. But none of that is possible so I,m at home all thetime now. Which is a bit boring some days. I am really yearning to get my hair cut. It is getting longer and more unruly by the day and also much greyer. My wife is a social worker and would normally work at home 2 or 3 days a week but is now full-timeat home. She is really enjoying it and feels safe so that makes me feel relieved. TECHNOLOGY. I think technology,especially the internet has been a godsend in the crisis.Normally my wife and I because we live apart half the week communicate using FaceTime a few times per day. Since lockdown we have been using it much more and it has been reassuring to be able to chat and connect. I have also chatted to my brother and family and my best friend inSydney using it.I also use Facebook messenger and e mails to keep in touch with my other friends. It,s beeninteresting hearing the accounts from friends in New Zealand,Spain,Bosnia and Sweden of howtheir lockdown is similar or different to us. My wife and I have also gone old school and exchanged some letters by post as we were bothmissing each other. Love letters straight from the heart and all that.I think social media can be a negative thing normally but for once it seems to be a source ofcontact and daft videos to cheer us up. The proposed contact tracing app will mean I have to change my phone. I have a very basichandset which I hardly ever use and keep in case I break down. I will need to be able to downloadthe app so may have to use an old handset I have. I used the online ordering system to send a Cornish clotted cream tea for one to my mother in law. She loved it. The company is a small family run business so it was good to use them. SHOPPING. Since lockdown my shopping has changed dramatically. I have used the good local butcher 1/2 mile away . There has only been me in there each time I went. I have also used local deliveries of fruit and veg boxes and a brewery who teamed up with a bakers and farm .I managed eventually after a month to get a Tesco click and collect slot which was great as I pulled up and they put the bags straight in the boot of the car. The second time I used it was like a formula 1 pit stop. I was in and out in 90 seconds .at. Fabulous. I am basically trying to limit my risk to the absolute minimum so I don't put my wife or mother in lawat risk. I have ordered a couple of things from Amazon like a new book written by a teenage girl survivor of the Manchester bomb. The only problems early days were as a result of other people panic buying you couldn't buy toiletroll or pasta. I had some so I managed and bought a small amount when I could.I love cooking and would describe myself as foodie. I have made sure I don't waste anything. Iorganised my cupboard and freezer so I could menu plan. I have enjoyed planning and cookingnice tasty food to brighten up my lockdown. ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE. 2020 is going to be the year that was OFF.I like watching sports. My absolute favourite is the 6 Nations Rugby . I am an avid viewer wearingmy England shirt and enjoying friendly banter with my Welsh wife. Sadly this years tournament never .nished. I follow women,s football and played myself for a local team in my late 20,s . Cant believe thedifference now. All football is off too. I attended the 2018 Commonwealth games in Australia and loved it. I was so looking forward to watching the years Olympics.This week we were booked to attend the Invictus games for injured veterans in the Hague but thatis also cancelled. KLM are refusing to refund our .ights despite EU law and a £9 billion bail out.They have promised a voucher and a refund in a year.Thanks for nothing.. We have  2 week long trips in the camper van planned for July and September. I don't think we will be going. I cannot MOT the van either but have 6 months extension which is a weird scenario. So we have paid for tax,insurance and storage but cannot use it. Our normal activity on a Friday is to go to our local old pub early ,about 5pm and have 2 pints ofKronenburg. 3 if we are staying out a bit and then go back for dinner at home. We miss this and our landlord friend. Cant wait to sit in the beer garden again.As an alternative in the last couple of weeks on a Friday we have had a FaceTime call and then my wife has put her phone on the fence to her neighbours back garden who are our friends so I havebeen able to chat to her and them and we have all had a beer in a virtual conference call. That has felt nice. On VE day 75th anniversary I watched online on FaceTime as my wife neighbours had put up bunting and one of them played cello in their garden. That was nice to see but also gave me big twinges of missing being there. My other favourite activity is to go to the cinema,at least once a week. I love to escape intowhatever .lm on my own usually in the afternoon. I get a costa coffee and sometimes a small popcorn and watch the latest .lm. I have an unlimited membership with Odeon and sometimestreat myself to the arty cinema at HOME or Everyman. I am missing the cinema a lot. I am watching lots of Tv. On BBC player the fabulous Killing Eve season 3. I love the cat and mouse between Villanelle and Eve. It is funny and shocking all at once. Excellent script.They release an episode on Monday which is good and avoids me binge watching it all in one go.I have also been enjoying watching .Race across the world where two teams cross a continent without .ying is good. The Patagonian scenery looks stunning but also reminds you we cannot travel any time soon. Net.ix £6 a month is coming in handy too. Very much enjoyed A Secret Love . True documentary about 2 Canadian women living in Chicago who had been a secret couple for 70 years !Then they needed a care home together and told their families. It was so sweet and sad. Their old photos and that they tore their names off the end of their love letters so no one would know were heart wrenching. It was a very human and af.rming .lm. Made us feel lucky we haven,t had to livelike that. I have been reading the latest girl with the dragon tattoo book and one called Lone Rider aboutElspeth Beard the .rst British woman to ride around the world on a motorbike. Brave and a bit madI think. I really enjoy listening to the Coronacast newscast from the BBC. I like the team on it especiallyLaura Kuennsberg. It started off as Brexitcast,then election cast and now the virus. It is informative each night and at times funny. I like to listen to it lying down with my eyes closed. Despite the tough subject I .nd it a calm experience to stop and listen to it. I have been setting myself daily chores around the house. The countries household tasks will never have been so well done. As a new thing I signed up to do this (7 weeks into lockdown ). It is something interesting to occupysome time and writing down how I have felt about this all is probably cathartic.Hopefully in the future it will be a record to others of this crazy time. I go for my permitted daily walk maybe every other day. 20-40 minutes around the local neighbourhood which is very quiet and everyones garden is looking well tended.I have also done a few minutes exercise at home in the lounge maybe dancing about to music for10 minutes doing some exercise. PERSONAL HYGIENE. The crisis hasn't changed my normal shower and bath habits but it has changed my hand washing.In normal times obsessive repeated hand washing by me or others would make me concerned forOCD mental health,but now everyone is at it. I have never washed my hands so much.Especially if I go out. I carry a pack of disposable disinfectant wipes and clean the car steeringwheel when i get in and out. I avoid opening doors with my hands. I use hand sanitiser immediatelyafter touching anything outside or in shops . When i have got shopping home I have .lled the sinkwith soapy water and given tins,bottles etc a wash and then dry or if I cant wash the package put itout of the way for a few days or discarded exterior packaging.I have changed my clothes straight in the wash and then had a long shower and changed if I havebeen out to the shop. As a result I am limiting my shopping to the minimum as its a routine to clean yourself every timeand I feel like I,m at risk in what I call the contagion zone if I go out.I cant imagine how bad people who already had OCD issues about germs will be after all this andmany others may feel a bit more Ocd as a result.I have felt that I am taking some control to keep myself safe with the enhanced cleaning regime . SLEEP. I have always really enjoyed my sleep and could sleep anytime easily. No matter what shifts I worked. I need a good 10 hours sleep.Unlike my wife who no matter what is awake at 0600 everyday. If I don't get enough sleep I get grumpy and even worse if I,m hungry and tired I,m very grumpy so I need to be fed and snooze plenty to be content.About 3 weeks into lockdown I was struggling to sleep. i was worrying about it all. The enormity of it. Worrying that my wife may catch it,or me or her mum. Worrying is it ever going to end . Will they get a vaccine. What if they don't . What if we get back to some normality and China has a different outbreak from their continued wet markets and questionable choice of eating bats or pangolins.I recognised that not being able to sleep was a sign of being anxious about it all so I made aconscious effort to watch less news. made sure the bedroom was as dark as possible and a nice temperature . I moved my iPad away from the bedside so I wasn't tempted to check it and had abath or a mint tea before bed. After a few days this helped and I have slept fairly well since.I hear from other friends that they have had similar problems sleeping. ————————————————————————————————————————— A decision about how I want to continue to write this. So far I have written on the various topics above about how it all feels to me and the impacts.I have felt it has been cathartic to me to record it . I have considered the process and was wanting to set a deadline for myself. I know the crisis willgo on for a long time and it may be that I submit a further document but I have decided that I willwrite up to 1/6//20 and then submit this.From today 13/5/20 I will do a day scribble of things more around just how I feel as I have capturedthe bigger picture above. So today 13/5/20 it feels quite uncertain. There are differing instructions in England ,Wales and Scotland. It is starting to get political I think.I am not going out. I don't feel safe to do anything other than a short walk at the moment.I feel sorry for the police who will have no chance of controlling the behaviour of people who do notwant to comply as the rules are now so mixed.I feel really sad about the death .gures. Its just so dreadful that we have over 32k and are theworst in Europe.I,m trying to remain positive within our bubble that we have between me and my wife. We are both determined to survive this. From todays news it feels that the govt is urging people back to work as a tactic to boost theeconomy. We need to move the economy but at what cost will this come.I am also getting irritated by news conference experts who are really poor public speakers. There was one on before and his delivery included the sound of “ Err “ about every 4th or 5th word.It grates on my nerves. Someone from press relations should pull him aside and replay the videoand if he cannot deliver without doing it they should get someone who can. Maybe that is me justfeeling grumpy with it all. On a more positive note from today we are allowed unlimited exercise outside…yipee..! not that iwill be doing anything different. But it says we can drive somewhere to exercise. I might drive the 10 minutes to our camper van storage compound and turn the engine over whilsthaving a little walk about and a stretch next to it. Garden centres are allowed to open…i,m sure they will have queues and I have no interest. I,m .nishing my book What makes us stronger this afternoon and plan making crab linguine later. Thursday 14/5/20.Woke up this morning and the headline includes World Health Organisation say the virus may never go away and we may need to learn to live with it like HIV.Firstly thinking,wow that is depressing. I really want it to go away.Secondly it occurs that is massively easier for me to avoid HIV as the two are polar opposites interms of risk. New Zealand have released their lockdown. They only had 21 deaths. ( tragic for 21 families no doubt ) and so far we are more than 33k. I,m going for my usual short walk as the sun is shining but it is cold in the wind.Made roasted butternut squash and spinach curry for my dinner.The 8pm clap for carers and key workers AGAIN. The 8th time I have done it so far.My neighbours either side were out and my friend who lives at the farm on top of the hill in front ofmy house waved at us. 15/5/20.Friday.The question of the morning is “ Do cows snore ?”Because about 02:00 with my bedroom window open I could hear this weird repetitive noise. At .rst I wondered if it was the two horses in the .eld but then when I looked out and listened I realised it was coming from the farm 1/2 mile up on the hillside and they have cows. The only thing I could think was are they snoring. It just shows how quiet it is that I can hear it. I had to close my windowso it did not disturb me. When I wake in the morning and FaceTime my wife she tells me that overnight there have been several fraudulent transactions on her credit card for random amounts of £60-80 . She had been on the phone to her bank and almost £1500 has been attempted or made intransactions. They have stopped her card and replacing it and have launched a fraud enquiry.It is so annoying. I hate thieves and to be dishonest during this period is even sleazier.She has no idea how the card has been compromised as she never uses it for online purchases.I wonder if it is a bank employee.I,m angry about it but she is calm as they have reassured her they will refund it eventually.I,d love to be able to jump into work mode and hunt down the fraudsters . But I can’t.If you had a choice of imposing one major change to everyones lives,like a super power for me itwould be that everyone has to be honest. If that happened so many bad things just wouldn'thappen. Our normal Friday activity is to go to our local 17th century pub and have a couple of pints.However we cannot do this. So just after 5pm we have a FaceTime conference between my wife and I and then later we are joined by our friend A from Knebworth so we all raise a pint and have chat. She has been busy marking work as she is a lecturer in PE and older than me,due to retire. Technology is ever evolving and she uses several expletives about using Zoom,many of which start with the letter F.I joke with her asking if that is a correct technical term. we have a laugh and a couple of beers . Saturday 16/5/20 .Just after lunch I had a nice surprise. Two of my friends who are a couple knocked on my door. They were out for their walk and we had a nice chat from a safe distance with them stood on theother side of my car. It was nice to see someone and have a conversation. I popped out later for ten minutes. The local food bank made a Facebook appeal and had a drive through drop off on the car park of a local pub. I threw a few tins of things in a bag and stopped them off. I,m sure there are people in bad situations so I have enough to help a bit. Sunday 17/5/20.A nice cloudy day.Annoying to see on the news yesterday hundreds gathering in London parks to have a protestabout the lockdown,to oppose vaccines and general anti establishment rabble rousing.None of them staying apart and deliberately defying the law.Why do they have such contempt for the medics? I can understand not everyone agrees with thegovt handling ,I don't think they have done well. But by meeting like this they put themselves andothers at risk. The poor cops sent to police it have no choice .And opposing a vaccine ? Really…what is their solution to all this then ?It angers me seeing rent a mob doing their “Aren,t I cool and radical “ attention seeking nonsensewhen the rest of us are trying to do the right thing . Monday 18/5/20.Day 57 of the lockdown. We approach the start of the ninth week.Raining this morning. Not doing my walk in the wet.Watched episode 6 of Killing Eve. Only two more left in the series. The only interesting activity of my day being going to pick up my click and collect shopping at 4pm.It was very ef.cient again,in and out in 2 minutes. Having scampi and some potato salad for my tea. Also made a beef chilli so it can be left overnight and then I will put it in my slow cooker for tomorrows dinner. Chilli always tastes better the day after as the .avour develops. The daily brie.ng points of interest. Bad,bad ,bad…total con.rmed dead (tested) 34796 Uk.But better news,the 24 hour total is 160. This is the lowest it has been since lockdown.So that gives some hope. But the numbers lag at weekends .I just worry that the recent relaxing ofrules hasn't stored a spike in 3 weeks time.The news coverage gives such mixed messages. Some say there may not ever be a vaccine andothers say there are promising signs. AAAGH….some certainty would be so nice.it is feeling very groundhog day now almost in week nine.A positive is I am saving money as i,m not socialising. must put it to something nice when I can.something to look forward to in an abstract way for now. Tuesday 19/5/20. I had a short .ve minute drive to the nice nearby village to have my walk and some fresh air.I parked up near the canal towpath walk and there were lots of tiny new .uffy ducklings . It was really nice to see and made me feel cheerful. I watched them waddling about and following their mum. A couple of the local cafes have started takeaway coffee service and people were qu"

D.’s symptoms were more long-lasting than mine – I would say he has taken a month to recover and only now is saying his chest is no longer tight. I tried to get medical help for D. but the doctor’s number was always busy and we were advised to use NHS 111, which I did. I took their advice and it seemed effective. If anything I have felt better mentally and emotionally than I was expecting. I am enjoying the slower pace of life, and feel that while have I a garden and allotment and company of D. then all is well. I miss my daughters but have been able to see them at a distance when they deliver food. The Government I am totally exasperated by the Government as they seem utterly inept in comparison with Germany, New Zealand or even Scotland. I realise these are countries all led by women but they seem so much more competent and rational. We seem to be being softened up for a considerable relaxation of the lockdown rules to save the economy. I will not be following them unless I am convinced that they are right for me and D. as he is in the vulnerable category. News I am listening to the daily briefing via Radio 4’s PM programme. In the beginning I watched them live on TV, then switched to radio. I feel it is disrespectful to send out minor politicians to front up the briefings. They seem to b e completely out of their comfort zone and just mouthing platitudes. I have only seen Johnson do one since he returned from sick leave. We need a leader with gravitas and dignity. Sadly he has neither. The media, with a few exceptions, seems unable or unwilling to challenge the narrative that is being formulated from Number 10. I would feel much happier if Cummings and his entourage were removed totally from the seat of power but the waffle we are given at these briefings seems to come direct from them. I think that using BSL at these briefings is a good idea. I read the Guardian every day. I subscribe to the Politico daily emails and I have found them very useful. I look at Twitter less and less. Work and home life I am retired and my daughters do not live with me. My home life has not been impacted adversely. Technology I have been using Zoom to do my yoga and exercise classes, my bookgroups and family/friend meetups. I have found the experience very rewarding, especially with the yoga classes. I am doing three a week instead of my normal once. In my bookgroup the participant who normally tends to dominate the discussions has let everyone have a go and this is an improvement. Family ones have been a godsend. We have a quiz, a meal and some drinks for about two hours. We have done this twice so far. Houseparty – we used this at first but now I speak to my daughters on WhatsApp video call. I don’t use Facebook. I play Words with Friends 2 with my sister every afternoon and we then chatt for about half an hour .on WhatsApp. We did this before lockdown. Shopping and food In the first week of lockdown the handle broke on my oven and it is impossible to get a repair or replacement oven at the moment. So I found an old oven from when we went camping and am using that if absolutely necessary. It has meant I am not doing all the baking that others are doing. The shortage of flour (I make my own bread) has been a problem but I have now ordered a 16kg bag from a mill in the Cotswolds. I heard about the problems with flour on Farming Today and the millers national association has put a useful set of links to local millers on their website. I have only been shopping locally. I have not been to a supermarket since mid March. Our local Budgens has almost everything I need. We have been ordering alcohol from the local brewery who deliver the same day. I think prices have gone up but I accept that and am not spending my money on anything else. We are eating and cooking much the same as before – apart from not being able to use an oven. Entertainment and Leisure I have been watching much less television as has D. (no sport). I have been listening to much more radio. I am working my way through Neil MacGregor’s History of the World in 100 objects; listening to the Gresham lectures when I go for a walk; going through the Drama category on BBC Sounds and listening to one of those a day. Music – I am not a music lover but have been playing Bob Dylan’s Murder most Foul several times every day. I watch the live streamed National Theatre productions every Thursday evening. I was a regular theatregoer before the lockdown. I have continued to run every other day – I was due to do a 10K race this month but that has been put on hold so I just keep ticking over doing no more than 20 miles a week. I do yoga every morning – Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube and three days a week I do a Zoom session with my regular yoga teacher. I also do an exercise class once a week with my regular exercise teacher. Reading – I find it difficult to concentrate. I have read the books that my book groups are doing. I started the latest Hilary Mantell but finding it hard to read a complex, multi-layered book. I had a pile of books set aside to read when the lockdown started but not one has been touched. I do some crochet every day. I am making Twiddle Muffs for the elderly from odds and ends of wool that I have left over. Personal hygiene I am lucky in that my hair is completely grey so I’m not worried about my roots but I could really do with a hair cut. I may have to attack my fringe before very long. Apart from that my hygiene routines have not really changed. Sleep My sleep has surprisingly been better than normal. I usually have real trouble with insomnia but have hardly had any problems for the whole time. I wake early – 5 – put on the radio and listen until six when I get up. I go to bed at 10."

And not only where do I start, but where do I stop?! I always keep a daily diary and that doesn’t usually contain much about current affairs or world events, but obviously this has been an exception because it has affected every single person’s life. For this directive, I have started by summarising what I recorded in my daily diary each week – the events, emotions, things I noticed or heard on the radio –and Iwillfollow that with general thoughts on othertopics. It seems sensible to say I will keep the weekly summary going for this quarter, perhaps until it’s time for the summer directive! Iwonder what the lasting impact of this willbe.  A recession seems inevitable, but apart from that, will there be any lasting positive effects? It seems likely that many people will work from home more and travel to meetings less, and perhaps travel less altogether, take fewer holidays or holidays closer to home. I have thought for a while that the world could do with emphasizing the local over the global, and this seems the time to do that. Weneed to support small, local shops, to appreciate our local areas more. Greed and capitalism have always driven everything, so the people doing the vital jobs have been under-appreciated. I would like to think that there would be positive change after the crisis but I must say I feel quite pessimistic that there will be. I think people very quickly slip back into old habits once the novelty has worn off.  I don’t normally follow the news – it is too depressing and stressful even at the best of times – so this came very much out of the blue for me. I suppose I might have heard some vague mentions of the virus but I hadn’t paid much attention. The first real time I was aware of it was on Friday 13 March. Iwork in theatreand wewerein the middle of rehearsals foraplay written and directed by Americans. Donald Trump made some statements about restricting travel into or out of the USA at that time and our director was concerned how that would impact our production, in case the rest of the design team wouldn’t be able to get over to London when it was time to rehearse the technical elements of the show. The director asked my colleague her opinion of whether the production should be called off or not and I was amazed that she was even thinking that way, it seemed such an excessive thought. I was also surprised the next day when a friend said he was thinking of setting up a local WhatsApp support group –it didn't seem that it would be so serious. WEEKLY DIARY Week 1 (16 March) I was expecting to go back for a new week of rehearsals on Monday 16 March but got a text at 10pm the night before, saying rehearsals were cancelled. The bosses of all the theatres Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager were meeting that day to discuss their plans, then that evening there was the press conference where Boris Johnson advised people to stay away from large gatherings. After that, it was clear theatres couldn’t stay open, even though it wasn’t expressly forbidden. The advice to avoid “non-essential contact” now seems wishy-washy in retrospect. Everyone will make a case for their contact being essential if you leave it up to people to police themselves.  On Tuesday I went into the theatre to collect some personal belongings. The tube had a normal number of people on it for midday and there were people in cafes and shops and in the street. It was nice to see that after having a couple of days at home and imagining that the outside world would be like a zombie apocalypse. At that point the office staff at the theatre were still planning to go in a few times a week to keep things ticking over even if more people were working from home, but by the Friday of that week, the theatre building was completely closed and the decision was made to call off our production completely – I got upset at that, even though by then it wasn’t entirely unexpected. It made it all seem more serious though. Nobody knows what will happen or how long this will go on. Initially the plan was for our rehearsals to pause for three weeks and then we would go back. Seems very naïve now to think that that was considered a possibility. I had another job lined up at the same theatre which was due to start mid-May and I thought I would at least be back in time forthat. I was given four weeks’ pay from the date the production was cancelled –morethan some people at other theatres have got. On Wednesday there were two flyers pushed through my door from local people offering to do shopping or errands for anyone who needed it, or even just to be on theend of a phone for a chat.  Very touching that a local community sprang up so quickly. My emotions were very up and down this week – both uplifting and depressing stories on the radio were making me cry. I couldn’t settle to anything and as many people have said, I struggled to concentrate on reading, even though that is my preferred leisure activity. It was strange, especially when if I did go out, things seemed normal and the High Street was still busy. An email from Durham Cathedral (I am a members of the Friends) made me emotional on Friday evening. It was St Cuthbert’s Day and Cuthbert was a hermit, so it is very fitting that we should think of him at this time.  The advice that over-70s might have to stay at home for 3 months caused a lot of worry for a lot of people. Some people in that age group were very frightened by that and others were defiant, especially if they consider themselves as active and independent as anyone else. I know a lot of people in that group – my own parents, several friends, lots of volunteers at the local museum where I help out. On the whole, everyone I know was leaning towards feeling positive and defiant – not that they were going to takeunnecessary risks but that they weren’t going to have their lives so severely curtailed. The brother of someone I know did start panicking and was unable to leave the house, forcing his brother to stay in with him all the time too. (They areboth over 70.) But another 70-year-old Iknow does theshopping forher older sibling, who has dementia, so she was obviously unable to stay at home and has to go Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager round to his house to take food. The “advice” often raises more questions when people don’t all fit neatly into a box –it isn’t “one size fits all” when it comes to categorising people. This week was full of contact with friends – texts, emails and phone calls, mainly from other theatre friends but also from a couple of schoolfriends who checked in with me when all museums and other leisure places closed down after Boris Johnson’s speech on Friday.  (They didn't realise that theatres had already closed at the beginning of the week.) It’s lovely to hear from people I haven’t heard from for ages – shame it takes a pandemic to make them get in touch though! Week 2 (23 March) I walked about a mile to B&Q on Monday. It is a fairly quiet walking route but there are parts where the pavement is very narrow so that was difficult and stressful. It felt odd to go out and to be constantly looking from side to side, checking where other people were. I felt on high alert, trying to beawareof everything. Iexpected B&Q might bequitebusy, perhaps with people buying sheets of plywood to cover shop windows while they are closed (very eerie to see photos of whole streets of boarded up shops in central London). The shop was actually fairly quiet and is so large that it was easy to stay a safe distance from people. The floor by the tills had already been marked with tape to show people whereto stand.  Then that evening Boris Johnson announced a three-week lockdown. I found that incredibly unsettling when I first heard it and didn't know how it would work or how it would be enforced. Would we get stopped and challenged in the street if we went out? How would they know whether people had been out to exercise already that day? It was confusing.  On Tuesday I went to the small Tesco Express at 7am. It was pretty quiet – only a couple of other people in – and I got fruit and veg. They didn't have toilet rolls but I got some at the newsagent, along with some tinned soup and tinned tomatoes. It is strange and eerie to see long queues outside the shops on the High Street, but at the same time people behaving normally, having a chat with the cashier when they get to the checkout etc. One relief this week was that grants for the self-employed were finally agreed, although not available until June, by which point it will be two and half months since my job came to an end. Beyond the basic details I didn't look into it immediately because I didn't feel up to reading depressing things.  A friend who was working on a big musical in the West End told me that the current plan for his show is to go back to rehearse in August, for a September opening. I can’t even begin to think about such a long gap. Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager Week 3 (30 March) It’s amazing how quickly things start to feel normal. It now seems strange to see people in television dramas standing near each other or shaking hands! I went to Wilkinson’s at 8.30 one morning (the time it opens) to get some paint and other things to do some DIY. It was early on in the lockdown but already there were clear markings showing where to queue up and squares on the floor to show where each person should stand. I was impressed with that. Adaptations can be made quickly.  Week 4 (6 April) A few of my friends said they found this a difficult week – crying over small petty domestic frustrations likenot being able to find a book. An actorI know has been taking requests from people for favourite poems and uploading the recordings to Soundcloud – one of my favourites was on there this week, “Church Going” by Philip Larkin, so I listened to that and foundmyself in absolute floods of tears. Ifind it avery moving poem but was very surprised to have such a sudden and strong reaction to it. I have started to feel more anxious, having heard reports of younger people getting it (nobody I know) such as a woman of 48 who died two days after first showing symptoms. I had been wondering whether to volunteer at a foodbank or something but hearing that scared me and I now feel like not leaving the house.  Previously I wasn’t worried about catching it because I am not in a high-risk category and I rarely catch colds and flu and other things when they are going round, so I hadn’t thought about it very much. I am also very worried about the impact on the theatre industry. Some theatres are saying they may not reopen until the autumn or even next year.  To balance the upset over small things, it is also important to note that I am taking pleasure in small things too. A friend on the next street said her neighbours have set up a jigsaw swap.  The same friend pushed some sunflower seeds through my door so it will be nice to plant them and see what happens.  The conversation I had with afriend who dropped some eggs off for me was the first face-to-face conversation I’ve had for a couple of weeks – from opposite ends of the garden path of course. Week 5 (13 April) I felt down, unsettled, irritated over small things at the beginning of the week. The neighbours cut down a beautiful cherry tree and burnt it in their garden, which really upset me. It seemed particularly cruel to do it when it was showing its lovely pink blossom. It is interesting to see how some businesses are adapting, and so quickly. There is a place fairly nearby which used to supply food to restaurants but has now switched to doing home deliveries. A local gin producer has started making hand sanitizer – I think quite a few alcohol producers are doing that. A friend left me half a cake on the doorstep out of the blue.  Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager A couple of my work friends have written me proper letters during this crisis. I love writing letters but my only remaining regular correspondent is my aunty, so it’s nice to think other people might be taking it up.  (It won’t last, I’m sure!) Another three weeks of lockdown were announced. I only learned this from an email update from the council – I’m not watching any television news any more.  Week 6 (20 April) I noticethat on the radio “post-lockdown”is now being talked about. Therewas adiscussion about how new social rules might be implemented e.g. restaurants might have to manage with 30% fewer tables/eaters so people can sit further apart. And how would that work in theatre? Removing rows in the auditorium or not selling all the seats? Apparently in the 1918 flu pandemic that is what theatres did. How would businesses cover their overheads? And will people want to go out at all? On the other hand, they may be keen to get out.  On the radio there was also a piece about how many homeless people have been helped into hostels and accommodation, almost overnight, during this crisis. It is amazing what CAN be achieved in a very short space of time, when these issues have been problematic for ages. I do wonder where all the money is coming from for all the support and furlough scheme and what the long-term consequences for the country will be, even though it’s great that such schemes have been put in place.  There was call for an enquiry into the allegation that the government ignored the findings of a pandemic simulation which was carried out a few years ago. I heard the statistic that eight weeks ago there were fifteen cases of the virus in the UK, and now there have been over 150,000. Amazing figures – it explains why it came so much out of the blue when I hadn’t been following the news closely. A stage manager I know has decided to give up the profession and retrain to be an occupational therapist. She wasn’t completely in love with the job but this has been the final straw –the lack of uncertainty when you are freelance.  On Saturday 25th I left the house for the first time in seventeen days, to go to the post box. I went at 7.30am to minimise the chance of meeting anyone in the street. I even considered cycling, even though the post box is about a three-minute walk away. Week 7 (27 April) I happened to see The Week in Parliament on Monday morning, not something I usually watch. It was interesting to see the tape on the floor and the ticks and crosses on the seats, showing people where they were allowed to sit – these were added during Easter break. There are also now huge screens in the chamber, so MPs can “attend” from home, so it is now a virtual parliament.  Quite amazing to see.  Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager In a way I now feel more detached and able to observe the new things people are coming up with, and in anotherway I’m also more worried about money because this week I had my last payment from my cancelled job. I’m very worried about how long it will take to sort out government self-employment grants and whether Iwill beeligible(although Ican’t see why I wouldn’t be).  Ican’t help feeling they will find an excuse not to pay a lotof people.  I noticed that all the seats in my local park have been taped off so people can’t sit down – they have to keep walking if they go to the park for exercise. I’m not sure when this happened – I noticed it as I walked past on the way to the shop on 29 April but I hadn’t left the house fora couple ofweeks before that.  Donald Trump said truly one of the most arrogant and astonishing things I’ve ever heard – something about shining bright lights onto people or injecting disinfectant into them to combat the virus!! He knows LITERALLY (I don’t use the word lightly) nothing about this and dares to say this in front of a senior medical adviser. I heard on the radio on 2 May about easing of restrictions which is now happening in other countries. Spain – joggers etc now allowed out after seven weeks of lockdown. They had very strict lockdown but bars are now expected to reopen from mid-May and it will take two months to ease out of it slowly. Austria – thousands of shops are reopening after seven weeks (small shops opened two weeks ago). Barbers have also reopened in Austria – there is a big demand for them –and basic face masks arecompulsory in public.  I saw a very funny thing on Twitter – a new account which started on 20 April, called Bookcase Credibility, and by 2 May it had 40,000 followers. It has become a new thing to examine the background of all the people who are now interviewed for news programmes from home and are trying to look intelligent by sitting in front of a bookcase. The Twitter account is written in the style of spoof art gallery analysis.  There is now very extreme overuse of the word “unprecedented” on all TV and radio programmes! Week 8 (4 May) Even more talk of things reopening – speculating about how things might work, for example, how train operators might implement distancing. I have a friend who works at Kew Gardens – they have still been going to work while the gardens were closed to the public but there is now talk of reopening in three weeks. People may have to book an hour’s slot to get in. The self-employed were finally able to get onto a website and find out if they were eligible for the forthcoming grant by entering their National Insurance number and tax reference. It was a great relief on Monday to find that I am eligible, and apparently I will be able to claim on 13 May and will get it by 25 May –we shall see… I heard on the radio that there is a kickback against social media “influencers” after quite a few of those people whose job seems to be flaunting a luxury lifestyle have been criticised for Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager bragging about being in lockdown in a huge villa next to a swimming pool. There was speculation that after the crisis is over the job of influencer might – if not disappear, at least have less influence! Such shallowness is shown up for what it is when so many people are struggling and other things are clearly more important.  Midweek there was talk of lockdown partially lifting next week. I’m not sure about whether that would be a good idea, or why it has been suggested. It seems so arbitrary – even if we are past the peak (and I don’t know if we are), it seems like a sudden change. But people do seem to be talking about making plans – a friend emailed to suggest cycling over to see me next week and wecan sit apart in the garden.  6 May – a new “Streetspace” plan was mentioned, widening pavements with temporary materials. I couldn’t imagine what this looked like but it seems just to be barriers blocking off part of the road to give pedestrians more space. I can see the need for this – I find it very stressful trying to get down narrow pavements when it’s impossible to avoid people – but the assumption seems to be that everyone can walk or cycle to work and that is far from true. A ten-minute journey on the tube would take me about two hours to walk and I’m not a confident cyclist on main roads. I spoke to some friends from the theatre where I was working when the crisis started. There are discussions about what the plan might be for reopening and how we would manage the situation in the rehearsal room and backstage. The space backstage is very tight and usually the cast would share a dressing room with up to five other actors. The rooms are not very large so it could be necessary to programme plays specifically which have a smaller cast, or to set up temporary dressing rooms in trailers outside the building or something. There would bequitebig logistical problems with thisbut it is onesuggestion. People arehaving to think creatively. Very difficult shopping trip on Friday – I went to Tesco Express at 8pm, thinking it might be even quieter in an evening, but it was very busy. I realised afterwards that it was the Friday before a bank holiday, but I didn't think that sort of thing mattered to people at the moment!  I think people are now bored of the lockdown and are getting quite slapdash with the guidelines. It was impossible to avoid people – in fact they walked directly towards me and stood very close several times.  Felt very stressed when I got home.  Week 9 (11 May) Boris Johnson said on Sunday night that people should go to work the next day if they can, but there was no further explanation so that caused a lot of confusion. On Monday night he explained it more but there are still lots of questions about how it will work. The other countries in the UK are still saying stay at home – their leaders disagree with Boris Johnson. I don’t know why he wouldn’t have consulted them so they could present a united front. It doesn’t look good when he is supposed to be prime minister for the whole of Britain.  Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager The guidelines are extremely confusing. Now we are allowed to have estate agents and potential buyers in our houses, but not our friends! I would much rather have a trusted friend in my house than some complete strangers, even if they are following guidelines. It makes no sense at all – no wonder people are frustrated with the government. We are allowed to meet one friend from another household outside the house, but I personally would feel much safer if I could meet them inside one of our houses, rather than try to go for a walk in public where it’s difficult enough to stay 2 metres away from other people when you’re on your own, let alone if you’re trying to go for a walk with another person. We are allowed to meet two people from another household e.g. parents, but only one at a time. What on earth is the thinking behind this? If you see them separately and they then go back to the same house, surely the contact between households is the same as if you’d met them together?!  People are really losing patience with the government advice, I think.  A friend said his neighbours had a dozen people over for a 40th birthday party. People seem to be getting blasé and bored with it so are being more relaxed about the rules. This then makes it even more dangerous to tell people they can go out more – if people were already not paying attention they definitely won’t adhere to safe distancing. This new advice is only telling people to do what they are doing anyway – giving them permission to take it less seriously.  It makes things even moreconfusing. On Tuesday I got an email from the theatre where I had a job which was supposed to be starting next week – obviously the job has been postponed but since I hadn’t been issued a contract, I wasn’t expecting any payment. I was very surprised to be told I was going to get three weeks’ pay, under an agreement which has been negotiated by our union. A huge bonus, as that will cover almost two months of mortgage and other monthly bills.  The time for the self-employment support grants finally arrived. I did my claim on 15 May and was relieved that it was so straightforward and only took a couple of minutes. It is strange to see some people going back to work when we haven’t even got out support money yet and our work is months away. Week 10 (18 May) Contact with people has dropped off after an initial rush of hearing from friends. People seem to have settled into this new way of doing things, whatever their different routines might be.  More theatres are saying they are unlikely to survive into next year, including big tourist destinations like Shakespeare’s Globe. The future of the theatre industry is a huge worry. Other industries are preparing to get up and running again, and we are a very long way off that. My self-employment grant came through on Wednesday –a big relief.  Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager Week 11(25 May) Thereis moreof ameandering feel to the days. Less need to tick things offalist allthe time, although I do still havealist, and Iam still keeping busy.  The days all include a few hours of reading, writing, and online courses. I finished the first draft of a short book I have been writing on Thursday so although that was satisfying, I felt a little lost after that because that has been taking up full days for a few weeks! Another two months of self-employment support was announced, this time at 70% of profits, not 80%. It won’t be available until Augustbut it will be a help. I tried to go out for a walk at 8pm on Sunday night, intending to stay out for about half an hour. I was back home in 11 minutes because the streets were so busy. I really don’t think people are observing the lockdown any more. They have lost respect for all government advice, and are no doubt a bit bored of it as well.  I started doing a 30-day yoga course, taught by a woman on You Tube. I do not enjoy exercise at all and have never been able to find a kind of exercise which suits me. I hate feeling too hot and I hate not doing anything with my mind so I find exercise boring, and I never get that endorphin rush which everyone talks about!  ButI was aware that Iwas being a lot more sedentary than usual – usually I at least have a ten-minute walk to the station and a fifteen-minute walk at the other end to get to work, and the same on the way back. I have tried yoga before but only trying to teach myself the moves, and I found it boring after a while. I would really like to keep this 30-day course up. The teacher is a real person with a sense of humour but also serious about the yoga, and there is no pressure.  Week 12 (1 June) A difficult week. I felt very emotional at times, sometimes out of the blue. It started with an extremely stressful shopping experience first thing on Monday morning (very busy Sainsbury’s at 8am), which meant I was feeling down when I got home. I get tense in crowds in “usual” times and now I am afraid that I’m getting equally tense if I just see one other person in a supermarket aisle so I wonder how I will be when I have to start going out again more frequently. Small things throughout the week then set me off and I found myself sobbing with frustration mid-week when Ifoundthedaily yogavideo too hard. Ijustfeltlike hibernating with the blinds closed so I couldn’t even see out onto the street. I did still keep busy every day but felt generally less motivated for most of the week, although back onto more of an even keel by the weekend. I did think that as soon as the self-employment support grant came through, that I would feel a huge weight lifting, but actually in some ways I feel more unsettled. Before the money came in, Iwas budgeting to makewhatever Ihad last for a finite length of time, which is how I live anyway, but now that the grant money has come in, I have to make a finite amount of money last for an infinite length of time.  Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager Week 13 (8 June) Felt much brighter this week and back to feeling motivated to achieve things – new online courses and new DIY projects. The phrase “gift of time” kept occurring to me. Since I am lucky enough to enjoy being on my own and to have lots of “inner resources”, and not to have any health worries, I should just appreciate having the time to do things, especially since I usually work such long hours and often don’t have time to follow my extra-curricular interests. I enjoyed the cold, rainy weather after a lot of hot sun –more to my taste! I deliberately went out shopping on one of the very wet days, hoping it would be quieter in the streets – that was the first time I’d been out for ten days. I did a “click and collect” order at my local refill shop, which worked very well –supporting local business but also minimised queuing time. I listened to an online talk about how to adapt theatre CVs for “normal” jobs, aimed at the many people who are applying for work in shops etc during this time. In theatre we would normally just list the titles of the productions we have worked on and the role we had had, and an employer would know what that job entailed, but the CV would mean nothing for non-theatre employers. It was very interesting and brought up a lot of things I wouldn’t have thoughtof. I’m not currently looking fornon-theatrework, but itdepends how long this goes on for. I spoke to a friend at the theatre this week and she said they are hoping they might be able to rehearse something in October, ready for performance at Christmas. It is strange that my first reaction to that was “oh, that’s good” because I’d been expecting that I might not be able to go back to work until January! Went out on Saturday evening, to have a gin in a friend’s garden about half a minute down the road. It felt very odd to be going out. A nice evening though. Walking back at 11pm it struck me how quiet the streets were, when normally this would have been a busy time in people’s social lives.  Week 14 (15 June) “Non-essential” shops were allowed to reopen from Monday. The radio interviewed shoppers who were queuing to buy clothes. Not something I’ve missed because I don’t see shopping as a leisure activity!  Face coverings were made compulsory on public transport in England. Any Questions on Radio 4 discussed the issues facing theatres. This is the first time I’ve heard any current affairs radio programme (apart from specific arts programmes) discuss theatre. The culture secretary was on to answer questions but gave very vague answers about the level of support which might be offered, and in the programme as a whole, the topic of theatre was given very little air time and most of the programme was devoted to discussing if/when children should go back to school. I realise that this is a very important issue to a lot Female, 44, single, Walthamstow, stage manager of people, but I really don’t think that in general people are concerned about theatre and the arts unless they aredirectly involved in those industries. Someonerang in to say that “people on the bread line” should get government help before theatres do – completely ignoring the fact that a lot of those people on the bread lineare out-of-work theatrefreelancers. Week 15 (22 June) On Tuesday Boris Johnson announced that the lockdown will be eased from 4 July – museums, pubs and cafes will be allowed to open if they observe social distancing. The “safe” distance is going to be reduced to “one metre plus” – although we are told we should still maintain two metres’ distance if possible. This is typically confusing advice from the government. Is one metre safe or not? If it is, why confuse matters by telling people to keep two metres away if they can and one metre away if they can’t? Apparently medical opinion on the subject is divided. Theatres are apparently allowed to open, although without live performances (!) The easing of lockdown backfired when there was a heatwave at the end of the week and apparently about halfa million people went to Dorset.  There were queues of several hours on the roads going to coastal towns. I saw pictures of Bournemouth beach which were unbelievable – I wouldn’t have believed that it would be so crowded on a non-pandemic summer’s day. A combination of the relaxing of lockdown and people getting fed up of being at home and the hot weather has caused it. The amount of rubbish left behind is absolutely despicable. People areso selfish. Thetrouble is that actually travelling to a beach is now permitted so each individual is not doing anything wrong, but things get out of control when thousands and thousands of people have the same idea."

So some of this might not be as the situation was in Spring, and more like what it is now. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? My mentalhealthhasn’t been great – I was formally diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder at the start of the year, have had a very messy end to my job in the universitysector, and I don’t think the virus helped. It wasn’t allvirus though and in an odd sort of wayit’s been good timing – ifI’m going to be too depressed to work, it’s helpfulto not have to work because of furlough. It hasn’t got to thestage where I’ve needed professional help, beyond the help I’m alreadygetting for the BAD. Mysister, though, is having a verydifficult pregnancy as a result of the crisis. It’s her third, and in the previous pregnancies she had diabetes. She did againthis time, but the doctors didn’t look into it until she was more than halfway through, so her babyis massive fromallthe sugar it’s been getting. This has made things difficult – she’ll need ac-section, but they’re um-ing and ah-ing about how late they can push things. The longer the baby is in the womb, the more viable it will be, but there comes a point where the size and the diabetes become threatening. Myemotions have been up and down recently. I’m in a manic phase – hence actually getting around to completing this and the summer directive – which makes me quite edgy and paranoid, but occasionally euphoric. Ithink I’ve mentallyadjusted to lock-down as a fact of life – I can be quite self-contained because my house is big enough to provide me with an office space which is separate from mysleeping, eating or leisure spaces, and I have a garden, so it’s not the confinement that others might be experiencing. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? The Government’s approach seems to be to shift blame onto individuals and businesses.Agood example of this was at the start of lock-down, where pubs were open but the public were advised not to use them. Publicans then had the option of opening up because they needed the money and staff pubs with no one coming to them, or give up and close without being able to claim any insurance because technically theydidn’t need to close. Similarly at the moment people are told to wear masks in shops, but there is no enforcement. When we get ill, the Government can put their hands up and say ‘we told you to be responsible and you weren’t, so it’s your fault’, when actually they’ve taken no clear steps to improve the situation. If theywere serious, they’d be issuing masks for free and have people patrolling to hand out masks to anyone without one in public. You could turn it into an annual thing – before the start of flu season there’s anational holiday, everyone gets issued with7 ofthis year’s design, there are additional designs available like there are novelty postage stamps, people with medical conditions can get special masks suitable to their condition, after a month you start fining people for not wearing them. Instead, people have been left to buytheir own, they’re at risk ofbeing scammed, not everyone is wearing them and so on. If I thought the Government were half-competent, you could look at this as a clever way of keeping hospitals running at close to capacity, to minimise the time the virus is raging without collapsing the NHS, but the current run of cases is more likely due to their not acting in time and acting in this half-arsed way. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I’mavoiding the media – it had got to the point where I felt I knew less about atopic after they’d reported on it than before. I’mcatching a little oftheAmerican situation throughthe image website imgur, which suggests the situation there is completely out of control and that politicians are acting in ways which is making it worse for short-term political gain. A mate of mine who is a Health Geographer occasionally complains about the incompetence of the Government’s testing, orof their track and trace app, or their guidelines, but for the most part it’s passing me by. I haven’t watched anyofthe press conferences, but I caught one fromNicola Sturgeon right at the beginning. She was really reassuring, and it was only later that I realised that I couldn’t tellyou a thing she said. I wouldn’t find the UKGovernment as reassuring – Boris has never come across as anything other than a fool, and Matt Hancock has the look of a man who’s just woken up to abright light. I can’t believe that BSLisn’t standard at all Government press conferences. I grew up with there being signing all over the place – I think on Saturday mornings before the cartoons where it was still the Open University on BBC2 there was a signer for that, you see signers at gigs now, did the Government think they could rely on closed captions or what? Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I’ve been working from home since March, although for a chunk ofthat Iwas furloughed.The Universitydidn’t furlough staff, because it was planning on making its short-term staff redundant and the furlough scheme only applied to workers who’d still be there at the end ofit. I was on sick leave from there, and the charity that I work for mothballed itself as most of its clients were places which were closed like shopping centres and leisure centres. We’ve returned now the furlough scheme allows usto work for the periods the Government aren’t paying for – so I’m back for 20% of the time now. Both my sisters have homeschooled their children –that wasn’t such aproblem for themas they worked from home anyway (one sister is a child-minder, so had more time as a result of that stopping). They’ve found that the work suggested by schools is a little low-level, so have been putting together their own syllabi. They think the whole year will need to be re-run anyway to catch up the kids who didn’t have access to the teaching because theydidn’t have the technology, or who didn’t have the parentalsupport in delivering it. That means it doesn’t really matter what theyteach. I know colleagues have struggled though – you can’t workfulltime and look after young children. One thing we did do was move my dad in with us. He normally lives in London, but none of us fancied trying to care for himremotely. He’s a high-functioning alcoholic, so living here has meant that we’re drinking more than normal, but he’s still drinking a lot less. He’s lost his DTshakes for the first time in years, and he seems to be enjoying the change of scene. So, silver linings. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has y our experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? We’ve been using Microsoft Teams for work at the charity, and it’s terrible. It stores things in really oddplaces; it has both a ‘chat’and a‘conversation’function, one which allows you to control the people admitted to the conversation and the other whichdoesn’t alert you to new messages; it’s really difficult to connect to people without a Microsoft account; its video chat has almost no features. It’s really clunky and I hate it. I’ve been using Zoomto keep in touch with friends and family. We were doing a family quiz for a while during lock-down, and at the start I was talking with a different friend every day. Those both broke down as lock-down dragged on, but I’m still chatting to people about once aweek. I don’t have any social media accounts, but I imagine they’re horrible at the moment. Just boredom and anxiety. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? At the start of lock-down it was really difficult to online bulk orders in – both because it was difficult to get time slots for deliveries and once because they’d run out of more or less everything we’d ordered.That’s getting easier now. We started with astockpile of tins and dryfood anyway, because we’d been preparing for Brexit, and so were able to cobble stuff together from local shops. Increasingly, we’re avoiding places like our localsupermarket, where masks aren’t in force, for our local Indian supermarket and the grocers around the corner where people are more careful. Having said that, the queuing system makes shopping in supermarkets a lot more pleasant than it used to be. The crowds were quite stressful, so it’s easier with less people in. The staff seem a lot happier too, which is probably for the same reason. Ithink as a result of this we’re cooking more and having less take-aways. Cooking gives a bit of shape to the day. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to s hare your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies , learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. For a while at the start of lock-down I was doing 40 minutes of yoga a day, but that slipped about a month in. Recently, I’ve been watching a lot ofopera – the Met in New York have been streaming one from their collection everyday, so I’ve got to see a load ofthingsI wouldn’t normally. Bythis point, I’ve also seen severaloperas in more than one production, which is helping me understand the way they work a lot better. I should be working on my Spanish in time for the adult education term starting again in September, but haven’t got around to it yet. Istarted watching some Spanishdramas on Netflix, and need to pick them up again. At the start of lock-down, I was doing a lot more reading. I have a pile of stuff I’d got the University to buy me when I was staff, and haven’t got around to reading them so I worked through acouple. I’msort of read-out by now though – I’m slowlyreading the novelisation ofGremlins at the moment. One thing we have been doing as a house is the Metro cryptic crossword. My dad picks it up from the station on his morning walk and we allchip in untilit’s finished.We’ve now done enough that some of the clues are coming up again, so another few months and wewon’t need to think. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I don’t think my routines have changed – I’m still showing every morning and shaving twice a week. I’mprobablydoing abit more laundry, as I’m home and so can watch it onthe line to protect from rain. Other than that though, nothing has changed. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. My sleep is quite closely tied to my mental state –I’mpretty manic at the moment so amnot sleeping much, and earlier in lock-down I was quite depressed and so was napping a lot during the day. A couple of weeks ago there was a problem getting my medication, which has drowsiness as a side-effect, while I was manic, and I didn’t sleep for four days. That’s not pleasant – you’d think it would give you more time to do things, but actuallyyou’re too uncomfortable to do anything other than try to lie very still."

Partly because junk food was not ever a shortage on shelves, partly stress, partly lack of movement. I know that it has definitely affected mental health. MDW my husband has not been in a shop since the shutdown.  My friends are definitely struggling with mental health -we had to pay to fly back a suicidal friend from overseas. I hear suicides are up. Anxiety very much up.  I know people who have had to stop watching the news. I cannot go shopping at Tesco without gloves and a mask or city centre without a mask. The launderette says you must wear gloves. My friend who we flew back has a medical appointment once the quarantine is over. A friend in London has a drs note to say she cannot wear a mask (anxiety and breathing issues). My MIL has had to stay in as very vulnerable. I am sick of working at home and my husband is sick of listening to my work calls and meetings. I want to be back in the office all the time not just once a week (I am a keyworker). I worry that people are not social distancing on the greens and commons and city centre. I worry about the big demonstrations in London where there was no distancing. I miss seeing all my family -they are 1-3 train rides away. Until I can travel AND hug them it is not safe. My MIL is vulnerable and it terrifies me she might get sick. The Government I believe any Government would have struggled but that this government have made a LOT of mistakes. Politicians and their families broke the rules they expect us to follow. They did not lock down soon enough, we should have been asked to mask up sooner. They should have planned ahead so we did not have shortages of toilet roll, flour, hand wash, eggs, pasta, painkillers. I concede they have a delicate balancing stage between health and people losing their jobs and needing to reopen pubs, restaurants, etc. 2 members of my family have already lost their jobs, 2 more are at threat. I do not think it is safe to reopen them though. I miss bookshops and libraries. Our favourite restaurant, St Johns Chophouse will not reopen ever. A city centre restaurant that has been there since 1973 has said they are closed forever. W5975 Female, 44 Married Cambridge Admissions Officer I think if we were still in the EU we could have benefitted from help. And we should have been quarantining or stopping flights. Chinese, Italian and Spanish citizens have just walked in with no checks. I know of a lady in Norwich who flew back from Spain - which has a lot of cases - dumped her bags and went straight on the bus and shops - no mask. The government believe the infection came into the country on over 1300 occasions. News I have watched some BBC news but mostly check the internet for BBC news and local news. For a month or so I kept notes of daily infections and deaths but stopped as too depressing for words. I know my colleagues have been watching the briefings. I think for news of this importance there should be sign language. Or subtitles. Work and home life I am a key worker. I have been working throughout. Working at home but apart from once a week at the office to collect post etc. or when we have key offer dates/big reports and came in for a couple of days  I am working on the bed on a laptop, dashing to take calls and meetings in the bathroom when my husband is online teaching. We have no children but my colleagues do and it has been a stressful for them.  My husband I live in a tiny flat and have argued only twice in the lockdown, at the start.  It helps I am patient. Technology We already used Skype though speech sometimes sounds like a Dalek. My husband had to learn to use a specialist teaching package for online lessons. I have once used teams and Jamboard -a big fan of the latter.  I speak to friends and colleagues on Whatsapp, text, calls, Facebook and messenger, and in the usual ways at work.  I have followed Twitter and linked in more. Shopping and food Tesco for a bit had a separate queue for keyworkers so got in much quicker. You cannot get online slots. Shops are more or less back to normal now but at the start no eggs, flour, toilet roll, soap, handwash, pasta. I had colleagues drop some off for me that they could get from far out shops.  There were limits to how much you could buy e.g. 2 tins of baked beans. Some shops are very good at counting people in an out and keeping people safer -Tesco, Waitrose, Wilkos. Queues are annoying but it is for our benefit.  Prices are rising -I reckon it costs £10-20 a week more. W5975 Female, 44 Married Cambridge Admissions Officer At home I have been taking my hour lunch instead of eating and working through so I can cook for my husband and I. Now I have flour and butter I have cooked a lot of things I rarely made before: Meat and onion pie with pastry, cake, buns, cheese scones, flapjack, cheese and onion pie. Found out can get KFC delivered although have only done so twice. Entertainment and Leisure My husband has played more computer games, I ordered more books and management books.  We have watched a lot of Youtube -Asmongold, Omigon, It’s a Gundam, The Quartering, some John Oliver, Bill Maier, Stephen Colbert, Bill Burr.  My husband has watched a lot of Netflix.  We have spoken to friends more. RSPB said ducks and swans were hungry so ordered special food and been feeding swans and ducks.  Did some painting (walls and window). I always read hundreds of books a year.  Donna Leon, Martin Walker, Arthur Ransome, CJ Sansom, Holocaust books, management books, Jack Sheffield, Tony Benn. Personal hygiene I have had to cut my fringe. My husband shaves less. We get through a lot of soap -we like Dove and Imperial leather as good lather and our hands have not been sore as others say they have been.   Started off singing happy birthday twice, I now quote Macbeth (I timed to see how much takes me to 20 seconds).  I started off using usual face care; not bothered lately. I wear tops and trousers for 2 days instead of my usual one. Sleep My husband never sleeps well.  I and my friends have had nightmares, especially at the beginning. I cannot really remember mine but think it was around being lost or stranded. We have a fan on for white noise.  Kalms seem to help me."

Most of these already take anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety medication anyway, so it is perhaps no surprise that their moods have been affected. Some have had to increase their medication level or access online counselling sessions. My initial anxiety sent me into a flurry of excess activity. The house was cleaned from top to bottom and I completed many outstanding tasks. I also felt the need to communicate with friends and family more once the lockdown started, so I have made a point of keeping in contact with people regularly via video, email or social media. Overall, I think the government has coped pretty well considering the country was desperately ill-prepared for a pandemic. It is such a shame that we sold off most of our diagnostics companies to folk in Germany, Switzerland and the USA years ago. The UK has had to start from scratch to get diagnostic testing operational on the scale now required. In general, I think the daily updates from the government have been measured and informative. However, the fiasco over lack of Personal Protective Equipment has been lamentable. The other aspect of the whole situation which I deplore is that old people (the most vulnerable category) were sent from hospital back to care homes without tests having been carried to check they were not carrying the Coronavirus. It’s no wonder there have been so many deaths in care homes. I use my phone, the radio and TV to keep up to date with the news, although I limit the number of times I access the information each day to avoid feeling overloaded or unduly pessimistic. No, I haven’t come across anyone who does not have adequate tothenews. My husband’s profoundly deaf cousinhas nothadany difficultiesfollowing the news and understanding all the guidelines. I have done some work whilst in lockdown. I completed the final chapters of a local history book I am co-authoring and I have been helping various people around the world with compiling their family trees. Generally, I have enjoyed the time being at home with my husband during lockdown. We go for a walk each day and appreciate nature, as well as keeping fit and healthy. The only new technology I have started to use during lockdown is Zoom. It’s not my preferred way of keeping in contact with people, but I put up with it, even though I tend to get a headache after each Zoom session. I can only access it via my phone. For some reason it is not compatible with my desktop. I use Zoom for my regular weekly groups e.g. choir rehearsals and National Women’s Register meetings, but have drawn the line at doing my usual Pilates class via Zoom. For communicating with younger family members I tend to use Facetime occasionally and Whatsapp frequently. It’s the old-fashioned telephone for conversations with my elderly parents. I have continued to shop for food in supermarkets and have not experienced any problems. During the first week of lockdown it was difficult getting items like toilet rolls, pasta and bread, but since then I have generally been able to get whatever is on my list. There is adequate social distancing in the supermarkets. I tend to go first thing in the morning before queues have started to develop. My eating habits have not changed at all. My main entertainments at home have been reading, family history research and watching pre-recorded TV programmes. My favourite viewing is history and archaeology documentaries. The daily walk has been much appreciated in order to stay fit and get plenty of fresh air. My husband and I have also completed lots of DIY and garden projects. My personal hygiene regime has remained more or less the same. I have probably had more relaxing baths than usual, to soothe aching muscles after the daily walk. My husband calls anything under 5 miles a mere stroll, so we have probably been walking between 5 and 10 miles a day. I am a poor sleeper at the best of times, so it is difficult to tell whether my sleep is better or worse. At least during lockdown, if I have not had much sleep, I can retire to bed for an afternoon nap if I wish! (Please also see the Coronavirus diary I have submitted separately. See below on the next page.) MO number: B725 Female aged 59, married, living in Chester, retired FE lecturer, now Co-Director of archaeology company, family and local historian Coronavirus diary (17th March until 10th May 2020) Week beginning 17th March 2020 Having studied epidemiology at university as part of his medical biochemistry degree, my husband’s initial reaction on hearing ofthe virusinWuhan in January was that this would be a pandemic. Sadly, this has proved to be the case. Gradually, countries have had to impose stricter and stricter restrictions on movement of people and contact between people and this has brought out the best and the worst in people. Some are selflessly helping older and vulnerable people, while others are stealing donated food items from supermarkets and stockpiling toilet rolls. This week the supermarkets are totally out of items like bread, rice, pasta, kitchen roll, toilet rolls, tissues, canned foods, cleaning products, fresh meat and paracetamol. People have been bulk buying as though for a siege. Perhaps it will seem like a military siege during the coming weeks as more and more people have to self-isolate. Having spent time twice with a friend last week who is this week in bed with a high temperature rather concerns me. She assumes it is the Coronavirus but does not know for sure because at the moment only people who are admitted to hospital are being tested. This seems crazy to me. If my friend has indeed had the virus and this was confirmed by a test, she would know she would be in a position to help others once recovered. My parents, who are 87, are self-isolating at their home in Macclesfield, so family members are not visiting them at the moment. However, we are in contact by phone frequently and we are keeping plenty of petrol in the car in case we have to go over in an emergency. (It’s about 40 miles away.) Given that my parents don’t go out much anyway, self-isolating is not too much of a chore. They phoned the other day and their main concern was that they had run out of lettuce seeds! I was instructed to buy a packet of seeds and post it to them forthwith. There are more and more posts on Facebook each day. It’s taking up quite a lot of time scrolling through them. I tend to scroll quickly through anything that looks negative or panic-inducing and concentrate on the humorous or interesting posts. One photo that made me smile was of a Chester garden containing topiary ducks. Each of the ducks had been fitted with a safety mask! We are in an interim phase at the moment in the UK, with social distancing but not total lockdown. Whilst we can, my husband and I are taking a daily walk, to get some fresh air and remain fit and active. All the clubs and societies that we belong to have been temporarily halted, although there will be virtual internet choir practices and online Pilates classes arranged. Just getting used to an altered daily schedule, in preparation for when we are not allowed out at all except for emergencies. Fortunately, I am able to work at home with local and family history research. All the lectures I was due to give have been postponed until laterin the year, but this isn’t aproblem for me. I don’t rely on money from them because my husband and I receive private pension payments. I feel dreadfully sorry for all those on temporary contracts or zero hours contracts, who will be unable to pay their rents or mortgages in the coming months. It is hard not to feel a sense of dread and panic, particularly with the media whipping everyone up into a frenzy. A couple of days ago, one of my friends, who is a primary school teacher, was asked to take over running a class when another teacher was suddenly taken ill. My friend ended up having a panic attack and the Director of Studies had to take the class instead. My friend felt terribly guilty afterwards, but she is so worried at the moment because her middle daughter and new born granddaughter live in Lombardy in Northern Italy, where there is a total lockdown and she dreads them getting Coronavirus. Spotted the following poem on Facebook, which captures the mood in the UK this week: 24th March 2020 What a difference a week makes! My poorly friend is now in the cough/respiratory phase of Coronavirus, but thinks she is on the road to recovery. Another friend is now ill in bed with the virus. She has gone through the first few days of fever and now has the cough. She is hoping she will be alright and that her asthma doesn’t flare up. She is widowed and lives on her own but there are plenty of people keeping in contact with her. People’s reactions to the way the government has handled the crisis largely seems to depend on who they voted for in the general election. Those who dislike Boris and the Conservatives think he is making a shambles of the situation (a polite way of putting it), while those who like Boris think he is doing a great job and showing leadership and statesmanship. A polarised electorate once again. I have been impressed by the calm and measured statements made by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, irrespective of whether the UK is implementing the correct anti-virus measures. Life has changed drastically for my brother, who is Lead Director of Coronavirus for Public Health . To say he has been busy is an understatement. He is advising the government and is responsible for setting up hospital provision for people in who get the virus, in addition to all his usual Microbiology Consultant duties. He was ordered home at the weekend for two days of rest as he is not likely to get much sleep this week as the number of poorly patients increases. My older son is a dentist (specialist endodontist). As we are now in lockdown, the two dental practices where he works have temporarily shut. He is self-employed, so will have no salary coming in for the next few months. Fortunately, he always keeps six months’ salary in easily accessible savings accounts for emergencies. He will stay at home looking after his daughter aged 4 and son aged 2 while their school and nursery are shut and his wife works at home. She is a medical negligence solicitor. Our younger son and his wife are both pharmacists, so essential NHS workers. They will continue to work and their 4-year-old daughter is entitled to one of the nursery places for key emergency workers. My husband and I would love to be able to look after any or all of our grandchildren, but now the lockdown is in place we are not allowed to see them. There has been criticism of the government delays in imposing the lockdown, but I gather the delays have partly been due to the NHS desperately trying to source extra supplies, ventilators, staff etc. before the peak of the disease. The incredibly worrying thing is that the UK still only have half the number of ventilators and critical care beds that Italy has and Italy is struggling to cope. I remember a couple of weeks ago seeing TV footage of people being treated in hospital corridors in Italy. That’s what happens here on a normal day without a pandemic. Most hospitals have people waiting in corridors in A&E all the time and others waiting for hours outside hospitals in ambulances. The ambulance crews can’t deposit the patients, therefore can’t attend other emergencies and it is not uncommon for ambulances to wait for many hours, occasionally even up to 24 hours. Whether or not toencourage ‘herdimmunity’ is acontentious issue. Immunologists and virologists tell us that until a vaccine is developed, the disease will keep spreading until over half of the population have had it. The point of staying at home is to try to slow the spread of the disease until a vaccine is developed and this seems a sensible approach. However, there are some that think that we should encourage herd immunity by allowing/encouraging young and fit people to get the disease and recover before the virus has chance to mutate into an even more deadly form. This is risky because the young would inevitably end up spreading the disease to some vulnerable groups and cause deaths. Bizarrely, the UK seems to have sat on the fence and adopted both approaches in turn. Who knows whether this will prove in the end to have been helpful or a useless approach. The sad fact is that many lives will be lost regardless. The only consolation is that ‘experts’ from around the world are analysing data from all countries and comparing it with the approaches taken by individual governments. If nothing else, it might make the world more able to cope with the next pandemic whenever that happens in the future. 30th March 2020 Still healthy and well after a week of lockdown. My husband and I are making sure we go for a daily walk from our house while we are still allowed out to get fresh air. This is particularly necessary for my husband who is bursting with energy because he is no longer allowed to do his mile of swimming five times a week or his regular 20-mile walks with his friend. I’ve presented my husband with a very long list of DIY jobs to keep him busy, including painting and varnishing. I am limiting the amount of time I listen to/watch the news as it increases my stress levels. I can only cope with a certain amount of doom and gloom. The weekly classes I go to I amnowdoing online via Zoom(Choir, SlimmingWorld andNationalWomen’s Register), so they keep me entertained. The rest of the time I am busy with family history research or Chapel Archaeology research and/or writing. The builders closed the site behind Chester Cathedral where Chapel Archaeology are carrying out an archaeological watching brief, but not before my colleagues had worked up a good number of hours. We now have enough in the Chapel Archaeology bank account to keep going for about 3 years, even if we do no more paid work, so no worries there! On the subject of cash, the government schemes to help people through the lockdown are helpful, but so many people I know are excluded from the schemes and will have either nothing or just Universal Credit coming in. We stocked up with food on Monday. Have plenty of stuff in the freezer if we become ill and have to self-isolate. My parents, aged 87, continue to self-isolate in Macclesfield, but we are in regular contact by telephone. They have neighbours and the local church who will deliver groceries or medications. One of my friends with Coronavirus took a turn for the worse a few days ago and ended up at the local hospital. After stabilising her breathing, she was sent home to rest. It was deemed a safer option to return home. Plans are afoot to draft NHS dentists into hospitals to help tackle the influx of Coronavirus patients. This is worrying a lot of our son’s dentist friends who have young families. They may be required to go to the new field hospitals being set up e.g. in London, Manchester and Birmingham. On a lighter note, it is lovely that the air is so much fresher now there is less traffic on the roads. I am enjoying seeing a greater variety of birds come to my bird feeding station and love hearing woodpeckers when we walk through our local park. Spring is definitely here. 5th April 2020 Another week in lockdown, seven more days of long walks from our house. We have discovered streets and alleyways we never knew existed and I can tell I am developing new muscles in my legs. For the most part, people are being very compliant about keeping two metres away when we are out walking. The health secretary, during the daily Coronavirus update, was warning that he may even need to stop people going out for a daily spot of exercise. My husband, who is full of energy, would hate that. We have a large garden, but there’s a limit to how many times we could walk round the garden before getting fed up and wanting to spread our wings further. The supermarkets have imposed strict new rules. Only one person can shop at a time and then only for essential food items. No browsing or dilly dallying in any of the aisles. In the queue for the checkout, each person must stand on a cross, which is two metres away from other shoppers. Some shops have stopped accepting coins or cash, others prefer people to use contactless credit cards, rather than using the chip and pin machines. The most difficult part of self-isolation is not being able to see or look after our three grandchildren. Yes, we can Facetime them or speak to themon the phone, but it’s not the same as having a cuddle and a good snuggle up with a book. We usually look after our four-year-old granddaughter each Wednesday, but we are not allowed to at the moment and she is clearly missing our trips out and about. She asked us over the phone, “When is there next going to be a Wednesday?” I do wonder what young children are absorbing from the TV news. When I asked our granddaughter about her favourite nursery rhyme, she said it was Little Bo Peep. I casually asked her whether Little Bo Peep’s sheep found their way home and she exclaimed, “No, they all died in the field”. Perhaps our granddaughter keeps hearing the daily death total from Coronavirus on the news? Over 500 deaths a day in the UK, at the moment, sadly. Sobering to hear that almost a million Brits have claimed benefits (Universal Credit) in the last fortnight. Even more depressing that they are desperate for money and have to wait five weeks for the first payment. Yes, they can apply for a loan, but then that money will be deducted from their benefits in the future, making it even less likely that they will get back on their feet financially. My parents, at 87, are still in self-isolation and still well. They seem to be taking everything in their stride so far, despite the fact that two of their elderly friends have died of Coronavirus in their local hospital. They are not impressed that they can’t go to their funerals, but understand why. I gather there are now no church services allowed for funerals and the only people present are the vicar and a maximum of four relatives. Whilst most people are self-isolating, others, in the health service in particular, are working flat out. It is uplifting to open our front door at 8pm each Thursday evening and clap for the contributions our healthcare professionals are making. As well as clapping, people cheer and some even set off fireworks. People in other essential jobs are continuing to make sure vital services remain functional. We heard yesterday from my husband’s old school friend, who is electrician at the National Exhibition Centre outside Birmingham. The NEC is being transformed in to a huge, temporary Nightingale hospital to care for those with Coronavirus and he is busy laying the electricity cables. He had to order 64 miles of cable, which meant a cable factory had to re-open to fulfil the order! I think these temporary hospitals are an excellent idea. If patients with the virus can be transferred to separate hospitals, then a more normal service could be resumed in other hospitals. Currently, all non-emergency surgery and most chemotherapy has been cancelled, which must mean a lot of people must be suffering and/or be in a lot of pain. 12th April 2020 A third week in lockdown. A sobering and worrying week, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in intensive care in hospital with Coronavirus. A relief that he has now been discharged from hospital and will rest at Chequers for the foreseeable future. As the daily death toll rises, and has now exceeded 10,000, we are told that the UK has still not reached the peak of the disease curve. What concerns me is that the 10,000 deaths figure does not include those dying in the community or in nursing homes of Coronavirus. In Northern Ireland, records suggest that 50% of deaths are occurring outside a hospital setting, which means the true UK death toll may already have reached 20,000 people. Can’t believe I had topost apacket of four toilet rolls tomy 87-year-old parents this week! They live 40 miles away and were running short. Their neighbours had been unable to source any toilet rolls locally. Anyway, by the time my toilet rolls arrived in the post, the neighbours had managed to source a pack of 16, so I know my parents won’t run out anytime soon. On a more worrying note, their next-door neighbour is ill in bed with Coronavirus. She’s a hospital doctor, so presumably caught it at work. It’s concerning to think that I can’t visit my parents because of the lockdown and that the virus is alive and well and just a few metres away from them. Today is Easter Sunday and what a peculiar day it has been. No visits or celebrations with family or friends, although we were able to have Facetime video sessions with our three grandchildren. They were all high as kites, having consumed Easter eggs. At least they were in good spirits. The weather was fine and sunny so they were able to have Easter egg hunts in their gardens. There have been harrowing stories this week of families who have lost their jobs and have absolutely no money coming in. They have applied for Universal Credit but have not received any payments yet. One family with four children reported that they were being given donated food by their children’s school so they did not starve. There are the first rumblings in the press about the future economic impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. Some economists are pushing for the lockdown to be eased soon before there is a profound slump in the economy from which it will be difficult to recover. It’s tricky deciding when to allow restrictions to be eased because it is essentially a trade-off between increased deaths and prosperity for those who survive. I’m just glad I am not a politician. Let’s hope that my diary entry next week is a little more upbeat. It’s hard to see the positive side of anything at the moment. I shall endeavour to seek out and remember any uplifting stories I hear of this coming week. In the meantime, I will console myself this evening with some Easter chocolate and ‘keep calm and carry on’. 20th April 2020 Well, I am not sure I can be very upbeat when the UK death figures from Coronavirus in hospitals are over 16,000 and there have been at least 4000 deaths in care homes. Some officials are saying we may have passed the peak of the outbreak, so that is positive news, but there is no word on when the lockdown may be lifted. It has been extended for a further three weeks, much to the dismay of some parents, who are struggling with home schooling. It is worrying that up to 40% of children in some poorer locations have no accesstoalaptop or theinternet.There’s noway they can complete the lessons they have been set and so it looks inevitable that they will fall behind with their schooling. I heard one mother describe how she is struggling because she had five children at home and only one laptop. Her children are having difficulties keeping up with the timetables/lessons they have been set by their school. Our elder son is home schooling one of our granddaughters, which is going well and they are both enjoying it. But our two-year-old grandson is not so impressed and wants to go back to nursery school. He is fed up of all his toys, although he does enjoy the daily walk to feed the ducks in the local pond. Our son, on the other hand, is finding the walks tedious. Yesterday was visit 22 to the pond. The ducks are putting on weight. Hopefully there will be ducklings soon and they aren’t just suffering from obesity! There continue to be issues with not enough personal protective equipment in hospitals and care home settings. One of my friends, a keen sewer, has been making scrubs for the Nightingale hospitals. Unfortunately, she has run out of material and cannot source any more at the moment. She is feeling frustrated that she can’t continue to ‘do her bit’ to help the NHS. Boris Johnson is still recuperating from coronavirus at Chequers. He is reported to be reading all his old Tintin books, so I guess he is not up to returning to politics quite yet. He has commented that he fears a second outbreak of Coronavirus if the lockdown is stopped too soon. Nonetheless, I have noticed around Chester that some companies are starting to operate again. It’s mostly people who have their own businesses such as window cleaners, plumbers and electricians. I guess there is a lot of pent up demand for their services in the community and they don’t want their businesses to fold. 26th April 2020 Boris will be back at the helm as Prime Minister tomorrow after recovering from Coronavirus. Not sure that will mean an end to the lockdown quite yet though, as he is evidently anxious not to cause another a second deadly wave of the virus. In the meantime, accident and emergency departments at hospitals are only seeing about 40% of their usual number of patients. This is consistent with reports that deaths of non-Coronavirus illnesses, such as heart attacks and strokes, have soared. People are clearly either too frightened to attend hospital for fear of catching the virus or worry that they may overload the NHS. Doctors and indeed the government are now urging people to seek emergency health care if they suspect they are having a heart attack or a stroke. My husband and I have been busy volunteering this week. My husband periodically gets paid by the government to assess business grant applications. He was asked a couple of weeks ago if he would be willing to carry out assessments for the government's emergency funding for small businesses (on a voluntary basis). He agreed and this week he has completed thirty-two assessments. On the other hand, I have helped out two people with their family trees. Both ladies contacted me via the Ancestry website because they were stuck – one lady from America and one from Essex. My efforts may not have helped with the Coronavirus pandemic, but at least I have enabled a couple of people to move forward with their research whilst they are in lockdown. I belong to the National Women’s Register and one of the topics we are due to discuss is the consequences, intended or unintended, of the lockdown. Here are my thoughts: Positive outcomes: I have enjoyed the increased bird song and the peace and quiet from traffic. It has obviously been good for reducing pollution levels. The air has felt so much cleaner and fresher. My husband and I have felt less stressed without all the caring for relatives (87-year­old parents and three grandchildren 5 and under). We now realise quite how much of the average week is usually taken up with caring duties. I have completed plenty of family history research, both my own research and research for others. I have been able to enjoy reading more novels. I now realise how much I create stress for myself by taking on too much. Even in lockdown I have had a tendency to try to get more projects/tasks completed than there are hours in the day. Note to self: be more realistic. An increase in community spirit and kindness. Negative outcomes: The rise in deaths due to fewer people attending casualty at hospital because of fear of contracting Coronavirus or worry about putting strain on the health service. The increase in unemployment and financial hardship has perhaps been greater than anticipated. It has exposed how many small companies and families operate on a week to week basis without any savings or safety net. Increased famine, particularly in third world countries. More domestic abuse. Many vulnerable children not attending school, even though there are places for them. I am sure there are and will be more outcomes, some perhaps not evident at the moment. Some are saying that famine will be of Biblical proportion. Five countries named as being at risk, in particular, are Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela, South Sudan and Afghanistan. Even in the UK, food banks are reporting more and more people are struggling to feed their families. 3rd May 2020 Boris returned to work as Prime Minister on Monday 27th April and then at 9am on Wednesday 29th, his fiancée gave birth to a baby boy, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. What a busy year Boris is having! I like the fact that the baby’s third name is Nicholas in honour of the two doctors called Nick who looked after Boris in intensive care when he had Coronavirus. Boris has given his first interview about his experiences in hospital with the virus and has revealed that he was given many litres of oxygen to keep him alive. He remained conscious and was only too aware that contingency plans were afoot should he not survive. A statement announcing his death was even drafted. What a relief that he survived, not just to serve as Prime Minister, but also to welcome his new baby son. On our daily walks, my husband and I notice that more and more people are returning to work. We suspect that companies which were temporarily shut have now put in place measures to allow workers to keep two metres apart in the workplace. We also reckon some people are suffering from ‘cabin fever’ and that more social visiting is going on than might be expected in a country in lockdown. We continue to miss seeing our grandchildren and hope that we will be allowed to see them soon. My husband and I have been enjoying nature walks this week, actively looking for wildlife. We have seen herons, some donkeys, ducks, Canada geese, moorhens and a wide variety of small birds. It’s good to get some fresh air and to see that, despite the Coronavirus, animals, plants and trees are thriving. With so little traffic noise in our area at the moment, we enjoy hearing woodpeckers. Other European countries are coming out of lockdown and the UK waits in anticipation to see which restrictions are lifted and which will remain in place. Churches re-opened in Germany today. Services were held, but no singing was permitted. That makes me concerned that it could be a while before the choir I belong to resumes normal rehearsals. It’s not the same having a ‘virtual rehearsal’ each Wednesday evening via Zoom, although that is better than nothing. Whilst longing for an end to lockdown, I am concerned that there will be a second spike in Coronavirus deaths later in the year. This is no time for complacency. Until there is a vaccination or treatment for the virus, vigilance is required. 10th May 2020 After six weeks of lockdown, my 87-year-old parents in Macclesfield finally consented to us taking some shopping over for them. They live about 40 miles away and were worried we might be stopped by the police on our journey. The government have told people not to travel anywhere unless absolutely necessary and not to visit family members; my parents have been diligent in ‘staying home to protect the NHS’ and banning family visitors. What I find rather curious is that they haven’t had one of the letters fromtheNHSconfirmingthat they should ‘shield’ athome for12weeks because they are in a vulnerable category. Presumably they don’t have any of the qualifying underlying health issues. I thought cardiovascular problems would have counted, but evidently not. (My mother has had four heart attacks and has a stent and my dad has had one heart attack and has a pacemaker.) Various neighbours have been getting fresh food for my parents during lockdown, but it turns out they didn’t like to ask neighbours to buy non-essential/treat items. We had to take over"

Currently staff at Community Hub. Health Physical We’ve had runny noses, I’m finally beginning to think I must have some sensitivity to pollen because what else could it be? It’s not going away. I’ve always put it down to spring colds before. My daughter seemed to get a sickness bug, although where from I don’t know. She is general quite anxious, and I wondered if that played into it, particularly as it came at the beginning of the new term (of homeschool) which is always a difficult time for her. Mental I had a period of feeling pretty down when the lockdown started. I was dismayed at being so powerless in the face of things, and feeling like my employer wasn’t concerned about my safety. I had a little while of not wanting to get out of bed, but a neighbour noticed and made me up a care package and reached out to me, really sweetly, and that made me feel like people did care. I talked to people at work about how I was feeling and that helped too -nothing much changed, but it was good to know that other people were feeling similarly powerless and just doing what they could, and also my colleague pointed out things that I did well and that really helped. Me speaking up about how I was feeling ended up leading to a workplace where we all spoke up. It’s been weird. I’m not working with any of my former colleagues, although I’m in the same place. I miss the regular library stuff! All the kids have periods of anxiety (especially my youngest (9) who has developed a morbid fear of dying and is often needing a lot of extra support. We have all been grumpy sometimes, and we’ve all found ways of carving out our own space. Often for us that means going on screens, and I think that’s OK. I’m a bit worried about my husband who has been very angry lately. He had a month during which he couldn’t work, and he really stepped up to help the kids with their schoolwork. He did great, although he does have a tendency to micromanage! Anyway, last week he finally got his secure computer set up so he can work, and he’s really fed up about it. I don’t think it seems to him like there’s much point in anything he can do, mainly because he can’t do much while he’s at home. I can hear his frustration in his very loud phone calls, and he keeps on shouting at inanimate objects, and at us. He is sleeping badly, but he often sleeps badly, usually of course, we all get a break from each other. The Government To be honest, I thought that the herd immunity thing was quite sensible. I had an argument with a friend about it. She has health issues, and she felt like the Tories were just trying to kill off the sick and the old. I might have agreed with her that they’d be happy to have a bunch of sick people killed off, but it’s the old people that vote for them! Anyway, I could understand the decision to delay lockdown, and it has resulted in more deaths, but I can’t see that the deaths are going to stop when lockdown ends, we just need to keep them as low as possible, and keep working on treatments and hopefully immunisation. What will they do next? I think there’s an app in the offing that will trace who we come in contact with. Obviously there are lots of people who will feel that that breaches their liberty and lots of people who don’t have the tech savvy to use an app. I see there are loads of jobs associated with this, but I don’t know what they’ll look like yet. I think things will open up but in a different way. So much is going to be different. I hope that the government will no longer be able to rest so much on capitalism, which is failing all of us. I hope that they continue giving people decent financial help and that this leads to a universal basic income, also I hope that the way we work will change so more people can be based at home. In the next year or so I imagine there will be a lot of change, distressing change, I can’t imagine how schools are going to work with social distancing, I guess we will find new normals, and I guess like with a baby that everytime we think we’ve got it it’ll change again. We’re kind of used to things always changing at work now. I hope the libraries open up again. Hopefully we’ll have to live like this for a year or so and then we’ll find a vaccine. Hopefully the governments will not follow this avenue they seem to be latching on to of blaming people, and will take the opportunity to make massive changes to improve our society for everyone. It’s a shame there’s a Tory government, but that’s what we’ve got. News I’m getting my news through what Google feels the need to tell me, what I’m told through my work, Simple Politics on Instagram, and I check the Scottish stats daily on an article in The Courier (which is for the East of Scotland, but the stats cover the whole country). I use that article because it’s updated daily and is very clear about what could be improved about the stats. I haven’t watched daily Government briefings at 5pm. I thought the daily briefings were at 2pm? I have no problem with access to the news, except there is too much of it, I’ve stopped listening to podcasts on the coronavirus, it just stresses me out and there’s no point in that. You mentioned a petition for a sign language interpreter. It is beyond my ken why the English government wouldn’t have such a simple thing, but they do seem to be biased against people who aren’t rich white men so that might explain that. I’m sorry, but the English government doesn’t seem especially relevant to me. Hopefully the elections will go ahead as planned and we will be able to move on with independence. Work and home life The library has obviously closed to the public. One of my colleagues was in the process of leaving to go somewhere else, but she had been waiting on a start date, now she’s just been sent home and told to take her stuff. I guess I won’t work with her again. Another colleague has asthma. I was at work with her when we all got told to immediately report if we had any health conditions. I didn’t. She was having to fill out forms about her health. I’ve not seen or heard from her since. I guess she’s at home. Since the library closed it re-opened, although not to the public. It’s now a community hub. People call us if they need help with anything during the coronavirus ‘situation’, and we do various things to help out. We get a lot of random nonsense calls, which we’ve always had at the library. People basically asking us to google things for them. As library staff I’ve always just done that. That’s part of what we’re for. However now we have more phone lines and more staff. I’m not working with any of my old colleagues, but more senior staff from across the council who do stuff around communities and schools. If they answer the phone to one of the old dears asking something random they tell them to google it and then laugh at them when they’ve put the phone down. I guess that helps them look after each other, and they’re not used to public facing roles. I’m used to just doing eye rolls to the wall, lol. A lot of what we do is helping people who are poor or self-isolating and so have trouble getting access to food or medicines. Here in Largs we have lots of wonderful volunteers, who are actually organised by Miss 9’s teacher, who has really stepped up in the situation. If someone needs some shopping picked up, or some medicine getting we pass their details on to the volunteer coordinators who get it sorted out. We’ve managed to arrange fresh food deliveries to the island of Cumbrae with the help of a minister and the ferry people (not the company, the people), we’ve made sure that all the people who got free school meals now get at least the equivalent in food delivered. We also have free food deliveries for people who are self isolating, shielding (that’s when they have a condition which means their doctor says they should stay at home and not go out for three months), or who are struggling. We have a mini food bank too, so that we can get emergency supplies to people while they’re waiting for other things to get into place. Yesterday I helped a family with four kids to get sorted for regular supplies and got them an emergency drop of provisions including nappies. I’m also using the counselling training I did many years ago when I worked at a university, helping people to calm down and feel listened to. Lots of people are just scared and overwhelmed. At home we’re homeschooling. The big kids are pretty good at getting on with it. This morning they’re particularly motivated as it’s the last day of S1 & S3 for them. Miss 12 is just doing the last check ins with teachers now. She started early this morning to get schoolwork done. Mr 14 is already getting a ramping up of work, but this is his last day of doing languages, and he’s delighted about that! Miss 9 needs a lot of attention and is feeling pretty rubbish about school work. She’s very clingy and is sitting next to me now. She’s on BBC Bitesize now because I was getting really annoyed with her, and I love how the BBC have gameified learning so she doesn’t really feel she’s doing work. This morning she’s done art, hairdressing (on me), and checked in with her teachers. She’s also found out how to extract DNA from strawberries (thanks Glasgow Science Centre)! We haven’t had much contact with friends, mostly, although K--has been chatting with his friends a lot, us not so much. Me and the kids are all hanging out (quietly) together. Technology I’ve learned to use Zoom lately -I used it a lot early on in the lockdown for the Stay at Home Literary Festival. We had a few trolls, but it was mostly fine (although one of the poets got upset because of some racist trolling). Usually at work I’d do writing workshops and the like so I’ve been trying to do those online, in keeping with the rules I have to follow for work, which are annoying. I’ve done one of these just as a video to the computer camera, and others I’ve used iMovie, which has involved lots of going to and fro between my computer and work’s really annoying ipad, which is not up to date and I’m not allowed to update. I swear, sometimes the security rules make things so much worse. I’ve also (for work) being doing iDEA training courses, which are incredibly boring. K-- has been using Zoom to talk to his family a lot. I find it somewhat tedious. They are nice enough but I don’t get the in jokes. I’ve been using WhatsApp video calls to speak to my siblings, especially since my brother’s job was under threat. That has been nice. You get to really speak to them, connect better. I do feel like a teenager though! I’ve been using Instagram quite a lot (and Facebook and Twitter too, but mostly Insta). During April I shared a poem a day. I’ve stepped back from that a bit now. I think I need to stop being so outward looking. Shopping and Food. We haven’t tried to buy groceries online because there’s a big waiting list and there are so many people who actually need to do online shops. You have to factor in a lot of time for a shop these days and the First Minister says you should wear a mask (although I feel ridiculous, so although I’ve made masks and taken them with me I haven’t worn one yet. You have to queue to get into the shop and then when you’re in there’s a lot of waiting for people to finish looking at things, and having old men either push past you or barrel into you while they completely neglect to respect social distancing. It’s not just me being sexist, my husband agrees it’s old men who are hopeless at it. I am really bored of making food. K--is doing a lot of it, and so am I but it’s so boring. I really miss eating out. Neither of us want to go to the shops for the most part (although I volunteered to drive to Irvine to pick up his parents shopping for them -a big long drive by myself with my music? Get in!) so we leave it as long as we can to see who buckles first. He’s very controlling about how and where I should get shopping, which I try to just ignore, but it’s hard work. Also, when he’s making tea he’ll make a big fuss about how he’s going to do it and then ask me what he should make and what should go with it. He is old enough to work it out for himself! I mean, if he can’t be bothered to work out what to make why say he’s going to make it? We did get fish and chips on Sunday, but we’d had to book that in a five minute slot on Monday morning. I say we -I asked everyone what they wanted, and then booked it and then they changed their minds when it was too late, and then K--pulled a strop about how he just wouldn’t eat any of it so I had to get in touch with the manager to find out all the ingredients of the batter. Also I had to go pick it up, with my daughter because K--had gone out at the precise time on Sunday. Tbh I am beginning to see why I’m bored of cooking. K-- is being a dick. Entertainment and leisure Through April I’ve written a poem a day, I’m not sure if that counts as leisure, except I don’t get paid for it, but I’ve got a poetry book coming out in a couple of weeks so I wanted to get some poetical attention in the lead up to that! I’ve been watching things on BBC iplayer (Noughts & Crosses, Normal People), which I didn’t before, and prioritising taking breaks for myself seeing as I’m not getting breaks. I think this is good. It shows the kids that I deserve a break too. We have all been spending time on our separate screens. K--is learning programming, my son has set up his own Minecraft server to do a project with his cousin, and my daughters are enjoying playing and watching TV (YouTube for kids and Netflix) on their tablets. I know Miss 9 is watching Free Rein, Miss 12 watched a French film on YouTube for French and has watched a few more that came up. Mr 14 is watching the first series of Stranger Things with me in the evenings. In addition there have been things online which would have been physical events before. Because I never know when K-- is actually going to be here and he has a tendency to go out when I’m supposed to be going out, I hardly ever get to go to any literary events, and I’ve loved being able to go to loads from the comfort of my desk. If he insists that I don’t do that right now I can listen on a surreptitious earbud and make sure my video is off! It has been amazing to be able to talk with some of my inspirations, and I feel my poetry has benefitted. There’s another literary festival this weekend, so hopefully I’ll get to do that too. Personal hygiene We have to wash our hands when we come in from daily exercise or anything else. This is tedious and exacerbates my eczema. When I get to work I have to wash my hands, I also clean all the door handles after everyone’s come in, wipe down all the workstations (before they get there or while they’re faffing), and I have to wear gloves all day. When I’m preparing food parcels I wear gloves and an apron and it’s really hot. I wash all my clothes every time I get back from the hub. They’re sweaty but it’s not just that. Because we’re always in, and the cleaners aren’t coming any more we always seem to be cleaning. We get the kids to do some, but I’ve cleaned the kitchen twice already today and I’ll be cleaning it again before the day’s done. My hair is growing out somewhat. I actually do have hair dye, but I’m not sure I want to use it or just grow it out. My neighbour, who cares a lot about appearances, is distraught because she has her hair dyed two different colours by her hairdresser and now she’s got grey roots. I offered her my hair dye but she doesn’t want to mess up the hairdresser’s hard work. Hairdressers have killed my hair so many times I’m wondering if it’s not a good thing we’re having to do it ourselves. Sleep I’m doing fine with sleep. My husband is not, but he never sleeps well. Actually he sleeps OK, but whenever he wakes up instead of going back to sleep he throws a strop about waking up and looks at his phone. He will not countenance not doing this stupid activity. Miss 9 is also getting very stressed out and having trouble sleeping sometimes, I’m trying to counter that by making sure to spend a long time with her in the evening calming her down and trying to get her to bed earlier than K--says she should go. A lot of it is down to her being so tired that every little thing gets monstrous in her mind. I haven’t had any interesting dreams, sorry!"

It’s so sad the way that it’s affected so many people. Thank god that so far, it hasn’t affected anyone in my family. We are all ok. Ive been fine. Im currently working from home / juggling that with home schooling and keeping the housework done. And do you know something? Im absolutely loving it. Im sooooooo chilled. I get up, get my son up. He sets up doing his school work at the dining table. I sit in the living room doing my work. Ill intersperse this with a bit of housework when I start to get fed up and that’s that. I don’t want to have to go back to work however they will want me back at some point. Shame. Ive never used Skype or Microsoft teams so much. In fact, I’d never heard of Microsoft teams before the lockdown. Now Im on such meetings every week. Its fine actually. It’s quite nice to have a chat to people and see them through the screen. My workload is so much easier to get through not having constant interruptions in work though. It’s great. Our household has been pretty chilled. We are still all getting on. None of us has buried the other under the patio and we haven’t had one decent row which im sure is rare in most households. Initially our son had a meltdown when he saw the amount of schoolwork that the school sent him. He couldn’t understand how he was expected to do work that they haven’t yet covered in school. I had to try and explain that the school didn’t know how long they would be off. Of course it hadn’t been covered yet, they couldn’t see into the future and that it was a case of using technology more to find out what was needed. The school are in regular contact. The kids have access to teacher’s emails. Google is great to assist them in finding out info and in all honesty his school couldn’t do anymore. They even have staff on board to speak to kids who are struggling with stress or can’t cope. Don’t know about the mothers though…. Maybe theres free access to gin. !!! I’ll have to look into that. I don’t want my son to go back to school as yet though they’ve been off since March. It’s now June. Im happy for him to stay off until the September term is due to start. What’s the point in going back for a few weeks? It’s so much safer for them to stay at home safe for a few more weeks a couple of children over in England have already contracted it this past week after their schools went back. if you are wary of reopening shops and bars / restaurants etc, then why are you happy to send children back when you know that they won’t social distance, they will gather closely together. You are basically treating them as guinea pigs. Sorry, however this mother doesn’t want her child to be a human guinea pig I’d like to be able to go out and have a coffee or something though. Apart from that though, im fine. theres so many people moaning about it though saying that we shouldn’t be made to stay at home, it’s against human rights etc. for god’s sake, you are being asked to be sensible. Stay at home. Don’t pass a deadly virus around by going out and about as usual. (For most unemployed lazy buggers it won’t make any difference. They have been practising for years). We aren’t being bombed out of our homes. We aren’t being rationed. We don’t have to send our children away to strangers etc. It’s not like living through a war. It’s for a couple of months. Not 5 yrs. People haven’t got a clue. People are so bloody selfish nowadays. How WOULD they cope if it was WW3? I dread to think Im a bit dubious about the government decisions at the moment. Is he having a breakdown? He was late putting lockdown in. then late with the procedures of how to deal with those breaching the lockdown. Then Boris was really ill himself. But then when he came back, he was all for reopening everything. Hang on a minute, you nearly died. Your girlfriend was about to drop a baby, then she showed signs of it and yet you then wanted life to get back to normal??? Is he having a breakdown?? God knows what’s going on. This is the new normal for a while though. If it means that we have to wear face masks when out and about shopping etc, in parks etc or that there are less tables in bars and restaurants so that tables are away from each other for a while then so be it. At least they can start to re-open and get some money in. I don’t think anyone would mind having to wear a mask out in public for a few months if it meant getting back to some normality Obviously, you can’t eat with a mask on. But the staff can have theirs on and as long as you are 6 ft. away from the next table while you eat, it shouldn’t be a problem. We are due to have our marriage blessed in September. I know its still 10 weeks away and im being selfish but I really don’t want to cancel it. Theres only 16 of us. Im hoping it can still go ahead. England is ahead of wales at the moment. They are opening. It’s happening in England. If they want the 16 of us to wear masks during the service, that’s fine. As long as I can take it off outside for a couple of photos and then put it back on. I just don’t want to reschedule it as I know so many others who have had to. I’ve been trying to not watch the news to be honest. It’s too depressing. I don’t want a daily update of deaths. I get so confused with what you can and can’t do. Just decide what and can’t be done, announce it on a pre-organised time and day so everyone can be made aware and leave it at that. Ive got too much else to do than sit watching the TV for updates. Family and friends have taken to either face timing or whatsapping. It’s good. On a Saturday, we’ve invented the “polcon arms “which is our virtual pub. We and our mates decide what time to be ready and then we all log on, with our booze and chat the night away. 4 or 5 hrs. Later, all suitably pissed, we all log off and go to bed. No taxis, no pub prices, can go to the fridge to get munchies when you want. Bloody ideal. You can even do it in your Jim jams. Even my parents whatsapp our son every week to speak to him. They would never have done that before. They didn’t know how to. The only thing I do find stressful is the weekly shop at the moment. Luckily I shop at aldi and as they have their “ all day every day “ preference for emergency services, I don’t have to cue as I can flash the warrant card and go straight in. however, although im quite used to the social distancing In the shop, with the 2 metre squares, a lot aren’t. So many times Ive been heard to say “for F**ks sake Mrs, get out my square “as some silly cow reaches across me to grab a bunch of bananas. Oh it really winds me up. Or you get the peruses. The ones who going shopping is their weekly highlight. So they just stand there and look at the shelves, for ages, then move 2 ft. to the left and do the same. Then again. You are waiting for them to move on so you can move on but no. then they walk on without choosing anything. Stop dawdling, get in, and get out. That’s my motto. Then I had the row with the fella last week who didn’t think I should be allowed in with my warrant card if I wasn’t in work!!! I therefore told him in front of the queue which made him look like a dick that “if I was in work, then I wouldn’t be here trying to do my weekly shop would I dickhead?? “. Honestly some people. Can you imagine if I’d gone in in uniform? Parked up in full police car, blue lights going with a shopping trolley to do a full shop. Oh sorry not just a full shop, a shop also for my parents as they are isolating due to health issues. Trying to separate two lots of shopping in one trolley and going from two separate lists as you move your way along the 2mtr squares is a nightmare I can tell you. But sorry, next time, I’ll do it in full uniform rather than in shorts shall I?? That’s the only thing that’s really winding me up, stupid people! What I can’t understand is those who aren’t getting dressed though or keeping up with hygiene. What so because you aren’t going out in public as such, that means that you don’t need to wash / brush your teeth / do your hair or dress?? Ok, so we all need a good hair colour. Embrace the grey …not. Thank god for amazon prime for both hair colour and gin. I still get dressed, brush my teeth etc even if im not leaving the house. I always have. It’s like my mum said at the beginning of this, “to get dressed makes you feel better. It makes you feel more normal. “Ive always been brought up to come downstairs once dressed. I never do anything otherwise. Apart from Xmas day. That’s the exception. I will, allow myself to open pressies in my jammies. That’s because I may have new Xmas clothes. I can then dress in them for the day and have a new outfit on in time to cook Xmas dinner. Yay. That’s the only time though. Even if I don’t feel well, I still get dressed and go downstairs, even if I end up ill and going back to bed. At least I’ve made the effort. The only difference during lockdown is, im not wearing my magnetic eyelashes ( my natural ones are weak and fall out so I look like an alien ) or draw on / fill in my eyebrows ( my eyebrows have a light tattooing, same reason as the lashes, they fell out ). AND wait for it…. Im not always wearing a bra shock horror. These bad boys are rocking and rolling in my tops, in a bid for freedom. Hey im not going anywhere. The furthest I’ve gone is the back garden. Who needs to sit in a sweaty bra in the sun? Although I was embarrassed when an incident happened in the street which brought all the residents out. I went out to sort it out and came back in realising my girls had been bouncing around in my top free as a bird. Oh god, I hope no one noticed. It wasn’t cold out there I don’t think! Sleep wise im fine. A lot of people are saying that they aren’t sleeping properly possibly due to the stress of it all. Fortunately for me, that doesn’t seem to be an issue. I can sleep anywhere, anytime, standing up, laying down. No strange dreams other than the normal crap. Ive not really been affected in this way. I know my mum has though but then shes never been a great sleeper. I don’t know why it’s affecting so many like this. I think I’ve got to the point that I can’t change anything. Im doing what I can to stay and keep myself and family safe and therefore im not pondering on it too much. Theres no point in worrying about things either you can’t change or that have already happened. A few years ago I wouldn’t have been able to say that. I was one of those who worried if they didn’t have anything to worry about. Now I just can’t be arsed. It’s too much, it gives me a headache"

I have continued to suffer short periods of instability but they result from my pre-existing condition. My emotions have been subject to short periods of extremes but again these are ongoing and not caused by the current situation. Government Given the unprecedented situation I believe that the Government has done it’s best to protect and support the population, maintain health services and minimise the effect on the economy. With hindsight the timing of actions could have been different with only limited variation in the outcomes. Lifting the “lockdown” must not be rushed and hopefully the Government will not give in to the attitudes of self-serving minorities who would endanger us all. Boris Johnson has shown a more Statesman like approach than I believed he would and has provided greater leadership and confidence than a majority of our politicians. Opposition Parties (supported by the media) create illusory problems for their own ends rather than support decisive constructive approaches. News Gleaned from Local and National Radio, BBC Reporting and to a lesser extent news reporting on the Internet. I have watched most of the Daily Briefings. Have in the main provided dependable information and gave confidence that the situation was being well handled. The Scientific and Medical Advisors have consistently presented a competent and knowledgeable attitude. Some of the Government Spokesmen are confident and present themselves well (eg Matt Hancock; Dominic Raab) but unfortunately one or two others are clearly out of their depth and struggling. I haven’t had any problems with access to the news. M6756 Male 69 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance The use of BSL Interpreters is not necessary and would simply provide further distraction and confusion. There is already extensive use of sub-titles which are as easily seen as BSL Interpretation and actually contribute to the information supply rather than detracting from it. Work & home life Having Retired on ill-health grounds almost 20 years ago and as a result of living most of that time alone there has been little change. Technology I was already to using Skype and WhatsApp on a daily basis and have now also used Microsoft Teams, FaceTime and Zoom to keep in touch with family and to maintain contact with others ie Tai Chi and Exercise I have also deliberately telephoned people I would be seeing regularly normally and others who I haven’t been in contact with for too long a time. Social media platforms I consider to be anathema to real life contacts and degrading. I therefore have as little to do with them as possible. Shopping & Food There have been no changes to my diet but the enforcement of “social distancing” rules has in fact made supermarket shopping much more enjoyable ie less people and ease of finding items Entertainment & Leisure Increased time spent on my Allotment has been rewarding both physically and mentally TV broadcasting has continued in the main to provide the same rubbish that has been dominate for some time. Have increased time listening to Radio programmes especially Plays and traditional comedies. Also listened to my music more than I have for many years.. I have taken the opportunity to review my will, investments, bank accounts and to sort through lots of old paperwork, photos, family items etc and decide what to keep and what to discard. Started an on-line Course to learn to Draw better. Reading as much as ever and in particular: Jane Eyre, Tale of Two Cities, Sherlock Holmes, Book of Nothing, Children of Time and various Science Fiction and my usual Magazines: Focus, Freemasonry Today, Banking World and RHS. M6756 Male 69 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance Not swimming daily, attending Freemasonic Meetings or seeing friends. I have taken time to consider how I spend my time normally and start to decide how I will do so in future. Personal Hygiene My handwashing has increased substantially and not swimming daily are the only changes. I have had a beard all of my adult life but it and my hair are the longest they have been for more than twenty years! I am seriously considering keeping the length and style of my hair and beard longer and different than I have done previously! Sleep There haven’t been any changes in my normal sleep patterns. At my age it is unusual to sleep through the night without “having to answer the call of nature” more than once. It is also necessary for me to rest most afternoons."

My life is completely turned around, I am fearful of the future and I don’t think we are out of the woods by a long way. Health I probably had Covid right back at the start of April. It wasn’t very bad, just five days of cough, feeling hot, swollen glands and generally off colour. I didn’t need medical help and just got on with it. Then a few days later I had some sort of relapse with difficulty in taking a deep breath and rang the doctor. You get telephone consultations now and diagnosis by magic without being seen. I was told that I was on day 12 and it was a common occurrence, take paracetamol and if it gets worse ring again but he thought in a couple of days I would improve. When you live alone and have no support network it is difficult being unwell but I had to get on with it and accept medical advice. Another fortnight down the line I rang back as I wasn’t much better. This time he felt he should see me but that wasn’t straightforward. As the surgery is closed, I had to drive to a different clinic and wait in the car. I was fetched by a different doctor in a sort of spaceman outfit of full PPE and taken into what I could only describe as a cell. After various checks I was given a prescription for antibiotics, told it was probably a secondary bacterial infection and to have a chest x-ray and blood tests. I wasn’t offered a test for Covid 19. The chest x-ray meant a trip to the hospital on another day, a radiographer in PPE and answering a whole barrage of questions before I was even buzzed inside the building. The next day I had to go out yet again to get blood tests. I had to drive to the surgery which is closed to the public, park in the staff car park and stay in the car having previously given them details of my car. Two nurses appeared outside in full PPE and I had to sit in the car while they took the blood. When you don’t feel well all these excursions are very tiring and unsettling. The next day I was telephoned by the original doctor to say everything has come back clear and I should be very reassured by that. The diagnosis is post viral fatigue with no treatment other than paracetamol, breathing exercises and gradual recovery. They are getting many cases of people like me so I am told. I haven’t had a Covid test so still don’t know for sure that was the original virus though they think so. I suppose once we get general antibody testing for everyone I will find out. I am not critical of my experience and I am very grateful for the NHS help but the whole experience is frightening and none of the people I met had any feel for how it is when you are coping completely alone. I am one of so many. As for emotions, I think I have coped amazingly well really. I have lived alone for many years and used to solitude so that wasn’t new for me. What did change though was my whole social life ended one afternoon and since then I haven’t so much as shared a cup of tea with anyone since that date in March. I have followed the government advice, stayed at home, some exercise when I’ve felt like it and a shopping trip once a week through necessity. It has been up to me to find ways of coping and I have but this has been going on for many weeks now with no end date. The Government I support what they have done and appreciate their daily broadcasts with the medical experts. Everyone is stepping into the dark and nobody truly knows what is right and what isn’t. I think we have an open democracy and I trust they are acting in my best interests. Everyone is an expert in hindsight but it is incredibly tough for those making the decisions and I pray for them each day. Looking ahead, I expect the Secretary of State for health will be made a scapegoat and shunted off out of the cabinet. I think the Chancellor will be forced to put up taxes, both direct and indirect ones, to pay for the cost of the furloughs and business loans, and then ultimately he will be replaced before the next election. As for Boris, well we have to wait and see but I think he has shaped up well and tried to give us real leadership. We are going to be poorer as a country for a long time but what alternative is there? News Each day I watch the government daily update around 5pm and think that is a brilliant way of keeping us in touch. It is depressing the hear the death totals and at the time of writing we are currently around 33000. I knew one of them well so when they say each day about how each death is mourned by someone I can identify with that. I like the way the media can ask the experts difficult questions and they stand up well. I think the way they have developed all the different graphs and charts has been good too. They aren’t treating us like children, we do understand how serious it is and I think open information means more people will undertake the lockdown restrictions more strictly. You will never reach some people who think they are above the law, don’t think it will happen to them and basically don’t care I ration my news coverage as you could be glued all day long otherwise. I generally hear the local radio news early in the morning, wait until the 5pm slot, watch the 6.30 regional TV news and then either the BBC or ITV late evening news at 10 pm. I suppose there should be BSL interpreters available for all the main news but maybe that could be just via the news channel. I find it distracting from the main speaker when someone at the side is making exaggerated facial expressions and hand gestures. If I was deaf, I would probably think very differently though and I realise we need to get information out to the widest audience. I wonder how people where English is not their first language are faring and how much they understand about it all. There must be a lot of very scared, confused people out there. I am just imagining a deaf, elderly person on their own with limited English and how are they coping. Work and home life I am retired and I thank God that I am. I would be desperate if I was having to go to work still or not able to do my job. To have money worries as well as health issues would be terrifying and I am grateful not to be in that situation. I have neighbours around me who are on furlough. I think the women have coped better and I’ve yet to see any of them out on skateboards as the men are. The men are restless and want to work again but we aren’t quite there yet. Some run restaurants and they really fear that they won’t be able to open up again despite the money coming in from the government at present. There are a couple of families home schooling and the novelty has definitely worn off for the parents. One family can’t wait to send the children back but another plans to keep the children at home until September. Such difficult decisions for them all. I live alone so have no one around me. I was touched when a couple of neighbours that I hardly know passed their telephone numbers to me for emergencies. It was very kind and if I was desperate, I suppose I would ring. Since then I have had no contact with them though and if I was being cynical it feels like they’ve done their bit. Technology I keep in touch with my closest older friends by phone as none of them have computers. The computer has been my lifeline and I use email a lot to friends and some cousins abroad plus WhatsApp and Messenger. I didn’t know what Zoom was until lockdown but love it. I have been able to join in leisure classes held on Zoom and stay in touch with the real world. I realised I would be very much on my own in all of this so decided to ring a few elderly friends around that I might bump into only now and then. Interestingly, though they love to chat when I ring them, they have yet to ring me back. I use Facebook but rarely post myself. I follow several interest groups on it plus our local town page and that is very informative. I’ve found some funny sites on facebook and enjoy them. My favourite is the bin isolation group that began in Australia where people dress up in all sorts of costumes just to take their bins out. It lightens up each day to see what people around the world are up to and a good laugh doesn’t do anyone any harm. I dip in and out of social media and don’t let it rule me. Shopping and food If I could get online home delivery slots, I would use them. I’ve only managed to get one so far and that was 9 pm at night. I am forced to go to the supermarket and limit myself to one trip a week. The only thing I am having trouble buying is flour so am having to buy cakes instead of making my own at present. I had stocked up very well on everything that would keep in the way of food and household products before the Brexit scares back in the Autumn so am working my way through some of that and it definitely reduced the pressure of having to find items such as toilet rolls back at the start of lockdown. I would say my eating habits are much the same in that I am used to cooking from scratch and eating sensibly. What has changed is that I haven’t been out for a coffee, to a café or a restaurant since just before the start of lockdown so have made absolutely everything for myself. Coming up to 200 meals on my own now! Entertainment and Leisure I am in charge of my own daily routine. If you live alone and run a house properly, cook, clean, maintain the garden etc then that actually takes up quite a proportion of time. I make a point of some form of exercise each day and it varies from gardening, indoor cycling or going for a walk depending on how I feel. I only go out at quiet times and then to an area of open moorland in walking distance where it is virtually deserted. I have spent more time gardening than last year though I’ve only achieved about the same but done it at a slower pace. I was used to going to art classes and they stopped initially. In recent weeks they have reappeared as YouTube videos and interesting to watch but there is no interaction so not the same. I have discovered the WEA (Workers Educational Association) online free Zoom classes though and can’t praise them enough. They have been my salvation really as you get to interact with the tutor and other likeminded people. I’ve done various crafts, singing and quizzes. The crafts are my favourite and I’ve learnt felt and fabric flower making, needle felting, papier mache and printing. Each one has been fun and to find fun activities is so important. I plan to continue with paid Zoom craft classes when they are rolled out in the Autumn as I don’t think I will feel confident going out for some time. I spend much of my free time doing my own crafts of sewing in various forms and knitting. I’ve also pursued my interest in family history and done plenty of research. Some of the research sites have been free in this time and I have been able to explore the National Archive. I’ve dipped into some of the Museum sites that are giving free tours as well on line. I’ve turned out a few cupboards, sorted summer clothes and moved a few things around in the shed but they don’t exactly count as leisure. I watch the TV but choose what I view rather than just letting programmes role on. I record things I like to watch later and also view a number of things on the catch-up service. I listen to the local BBC radio station when I am doing housework or quiet things as it is great company. I’ve also listened to more of my CDs and become quite addicted to the wonderful music that Andre Rieu plays as it is so soothing and uplifting. I thought I would get into reading more books but that hasn’t happened yet. Instead I continue to read a daily paper but now digitally rather than the paper copy I always used to fetch. I already had three different magazines a month delivered by post and have continued to enjoy those. I find plenty to do, don’t get bored and choose to organise my time so I don’t feel alone. I relish solitude and know the true difference between that and loneliness. Personal hygiene I can’t think that anything has changed here really. I am certainly missing having my haircut every six weeks though but accept that a longer style at present is what everyone alone is having to put up with. Judging by some of the home haircuts I am seeing, then growing your hair is no bad thing and I am going to resist getting the scissors out. Sleep I don’t sleep brilliantly at the best of times and am used to long hours of being awake in the night. I don’t put the radio on in case I hit upon some depressing news. It is hard to keep the worries away sometimes but you have to accept it is part of the pattern of life at present and get on with it. I generally make a cup of tea, look out at the stars for a bit, read a magazine until I am sleepy and then settle down again. They tell us this is a once in a lifetime event. In the second world war they had deprivations and dangers of a different kind. I’ve read that all we have to do is stay at home so I am doing my bit and doing it as cheerfully and positively as I possibly can."

What has changed now is getting medical help when you need it.  Getting medical help before the virus was difficult because our health services have been drained through years of austerity. With cut back after cut back our NHS services have been stripped back and it has been increasingly difficult to even get to see a doctor. Never in my own lifetime have I had to wait weeks to see a doctor. Before COVID we were having to wait three or four weeks for an appointment.  This is not only due to lack of funding for the NHS and austere measures. Many doctors have left the profession because of cut backs, long hours and bureaucracy.  Many doctors went part time – with a growing population and increase in demand, local practices have become less and less able to offer appointments. Myself – well I have had 5 UTIs this year.  This is possibly due to my age, but never before have I had these kinds of problems.  This was a major concern at the beginning of lockdown because I was in a desperate state of pain and uncomfortableness and unable to leave the bathroom.  Initially I was able to ring my local surgery and a Nurse Practitioner would ring me back and prescribe anti-biotics straight away.  This worked well at first, but when the UTIs continued, I asked for a referral so that the problem could be investigated.  I was put off and told I would have to have 6 UTIs in a 12 month period before I could be referred to a specialist. By the fifth occurrence of this awful problem I managed to see a real live doctor who then referred me for an ultra sound.  It was interesting going into the surgery to see the GP.  I had a clear set of instructions as to how I should arrive no earlier than 5 minutes before my appointment, wear a mask and have my temperature taken at the door before entering. While I was having my appointment with the GP, I thought I might as well ask for a referral for a long term problem I’ve been having with my knee.  I thought this was the only chance I would have of getting my knee looked at properly.  Again, over the past few years of cut backs, my own doctor had been fobbing me off about my knee saying it was due to my age, and wear and tear.  So I thought I might as well push to get my knee sorted.  In these difficult times, J and I have been enjoying walking – when we are unable to visit anyone or socialise, we have at least enjoyed walking and talking to take our minds off COVID, and without our dog to walk, we need to continue walking to keep our weight down.  The only thing is, I struggle to walk any distance now with my knee. The doctor I saw referred me to musculo-skeletal and I have and appointment on the 19th Oct, so it was well worth pushing for a referral. Hopefully now, we will be able to get to the bottom of my knee problem. Mentally – well, we’ve had a very difficult time as J’s mum died in June of a Coronary Tamponade, which is apparently very rare.  It has been a terrible time for J as she has lost her mum but has not been able to have people around her to support her through this heart breaking time.  Of course she has me, but you need family and friends around you when you lose someone who is so close to you.  Mentally, it batters your head – you don’t realise how much you need the support of people until you can’t have it. One of the saddest things for J is that because of lockdown, she’d not hugged her mum or been close to her for all of lockdown.  When her mum died she said, ‘do you know, I wish that I’d broken the rules and hugged her every day’.  But we never hugged our parents because we wanted to keep them safe and not give them the virus.  In the end it was all futile anyway because although J’s mum didn’t die of the virus, she died suddenly and had not been hugged by J for months.  J was unable to say goodbye to her mum, and wasn’t even able to touch her or stroke her face when she’d died.  We are not the only people who have lost someone. People are dying every day whether from the virus or other things such as cancer, heart attacks, car accidents. Life still goes on despite the virus. This whole pandemic is seeing an increase in mental health and emotional issues. When people are losing loved ones and they can’t be with them when they die, or they can’t see them before they die – it is tragic for people. My own family situation often has me feeling very emotional and in a desperate state.  My son doesn’t speak to me – long story, and at times I feel this should not be happening when the world is in such a terrible state.  I keep thinking about contacting him, but last time I contacted him (at the beginning of lockdown) his response was not good.  Maybe I’ll try again soon. The Government Our government have been appalling – always too late to react, always on the back foot despite seeing other countries go through terrible lockdowns and loss of lives. You would think that the way other countries have dealt with the virus could inform the way we deal with it. No, our government are not that bright. But not only are they not bright, they are selfish, self-preserving, capitalist liars. They think only of lining their own pockets, giving jobs to their mates or private companies that their mates are involved with, such as the ‘track and trace’. The decisions the government have made up to now have been appalling – sending all the students back to uni, ‘eat out to help out’, allowing pubs to open, saying that our track and trace system is world leading yet it still isn’t working effectively.  God only knows what decisions they will make in the coming months.  And the coming months are taking us into winter so eff knows how this will pan out. We are in an area that is probably about to go into lockdown again.  To be honest, the sooner the better.  But the government need to support people who will lose employment and money – they don’t think about people that are living on the bread line – they never stick their noses above the London parapet. They really don’t understand poverty and have no idea how much there is of it. Our government disgust me, they really do.  Boris Johnson is a clown! News  I for one am fed up of listening to the news, or from watching it at 6pm when I sit down for my tea.  It is depressing watching people being interviewed who keep complaining because they want to enjoy their lives and just live as normal. We are not living in normal times, it is not enjoyable for anyone – but to see these people being interviewed and given air time is appalling.  The BBC need to start showing people who are fed up, but willing to do anything to stop the spread of the virus. If they showed someone saying, ‘it is awful that I can’t see my loved ones, but if it keeps them safe then that’s what we need to do’, or, ‘It is awful and lonely, but we’re alive and we need to continue with any lockdown or guidelines and rules in order to avoid more deaths’.  But they never show people whose attitude is positive despite not being able to see their families. I don’t like social media, full stop.  It has no place in my life for reading news because it is just full of angry people who want things to get back to normal.  Isn’t that what we all want? But most of us just get on with it.  Often the news is misleading or it fuels people’s anger, so there’s really no point in taking any notice of it. I keep checking the .gov.uk website for updates, but to be honest, every time they put new updates in their guidelines they don’t tell you what the updates are or whereabouts they are in their documents – consequently you have to read the whole documents again and again to seek out the updates and you can never find them. Work and home life I’ve been working during lockdown because I work at a community centre and we support the local food bank.  We have people dropping off donations of food at our centre and we then have the food bank come and collect them once a week.  We are trying to have our centre re-opened.  We have made it COVID secure and as it is a County Council building that our community rents from them, we have to have them sign us off as COVID secure.  They have done this, but as yet they’ve not given us permission to open.  Now, on 15th OCT, we may be about to go into lockdown again and if that happens, we won’t be able to open anyway.  I’m fortunate, I am paid by the community so I am still being paid. I work 25 hours a week and up to now have been kept busy supporting volunteers and the food bank stuff.  But our community centre has had no income since March so I may end up being made redundant. Regarding our home life – J and I are very happy within our own 4 walls.  We are very close anyway, and nothing has changed for us.  But, we count our blessings every day and realise how fortunate we are to have each other as many, many people have no one.  We talk constantly, we love each other’s company and our life at home ticks over nicely despite what is going on outside in the rest of the world.  Yes, we are very fortunate.  We have a lovely home, a lovely garden to sit in, and if we had to self isolate for 14 days, we would be quite self-contained and could do it without any hardship.  But I feel it for those who are not as fortunate as we are. It must be awful to be stuck inside a flat with 5 children, or to be in a house with someone who is abusive.  I can’t imagine what that would be like for some. I never ever take a single day for granted. Technology Personally, I’m quite self-contained and can live without technology.  I do keep in contact via Facebook, but don’t do ZOOM or Facetime or Whatsapp.   I’m quite enjoying being slightly isolated.  I love my own company so it doesn’t bother me. Even if I didn’t live with J, I would love the seclusion. J on the other hand is more of a social butterfly than I am.  Not in a way that she has lots of friends that she likes to see all the time. But she likes to chat to people in her work, or passing in the street, or calling on people now and again.  She is a film maker and all her work dried up before the end of March because of the virus.  Fortunately, she has been employed by the NHS to make a series of informational films regarding the virus. So she has been seeing people in her work. Because J is a film maker, she uses technology all the time and is constantly on her mobile phone either communicating with the NHS, or other clients, or is reading the news and looking for updates.  She has recently been working with the Princes Trust on some community garden work that young people are helping with. If we had to self-isolate for 14 days, I think J would find it more difficult than I would. Shopping and food Initially, we were shopping for ourselves and 8 other people within our community, including our parents.  It was quite tiring, and at times it was frightening and made us quite anxious, particularly when we were wearing masks and other people were getting too close to us in the supermarket aisles.  We still shop regularly, but we are just shopping for ourselves now.  Our dads are both doing their own shopping so that makes our shopping experience a bit more relaxed.  We were just thinking though that if we have to go into lockdown again, we will have to start shopping for people again. But if we had to self isolate any time, we have enough food in the freezer and in our cupboards to last us about 4 weeks. Some people wouldn’t have that at all.   Our eating habits have only changed in as much as we are following Michael Mosely’s ‘lose a stone in 21 days’ diet.  We both piled weight on at the beginning of lockdown because we were eating anything and everything.  We both put on over a stone in weight.  Because we no longer have a dog, and because of my knee, we haven’t been walking the same so the weight just kept rolling on. Entertainment and Leisure Entertaining ourselves is not a problem for me at all.  I relish the quiet times and have so many creative things to keep me occupied. I spin wool, knit, work on my dolls house, make tiny baby dolls from Fimo with pushchairs for them to sit in. I play the drums, sax and guitar so I have plenty to keep me occupied – in fact, these quiet times are giving me more time to do the creative things that I love doing. J on the other hand, being a social butterfly, gets most of her enjoyment through communicating with people – that’s why she makes films.  She has plenty to give her purpose through her film work, but when she has no work she gets bored. She doesn’t have many hobbies other than learning the piano, but since her mum died she has not touched the piano once.  She has enjoyed spending time in the garden.  She has also spent time reading or listening to Radio 4. We miss going out though – not that we went out to lots of places, but the fact that you can’t just go to the theatre or for a meal with friends is difficult.  These are the things we miss most.  J said that if all of this was over with tomorrow, she would book to go to the theatre every week for the next year. Personal hygiene Nothing in our personal hygiene has changed over the last few months, apart of course from our hand washing and sanitising.  When we first went into lockdown our hands were so sore from washing them all the time.  Because I work at a community centre, we were washing our hands every time we went into the centre or before we left it.  I live a minute’s walk away from the centre so we were washing our hands on leaving the centre and then washing them again as we entered our house. That was probably a bit of overkill, but we wanted to be sure we were keeping everyone safe. Sleep My own sleep patterns have been all over the place.  Initially all my dreams were vivid and always about the virus – full of people trying to get away from it, or trying to unscramble puzzles about it. They’ve settled down a bit lately, but my dreams now are still overcrowded and full of people – there is always some problem in my dreams that I am trying to solve or combat. I am constantly rescuing people or trying to make everything alright.  I’ve always had vivid dreams anyway, and often they are so bizarre that they would make fantastic films.  But my dreams are never just calm or lovely anymore."

We are really lucky to live in a six-bedroom Victorian house, each with our own room. A big garden. We can have our own space and we share meals and chores. My daughter (11) and I, plus a couple in their 50s and their 21-year old son, and another 27-year old lodger. There’s always woodworking or live music going on, or cooking or the sewing of masks. It doesn’t really feel like a lockdown. We had to do 14 days of self-isolation when one person got symptoms and I seemed to be the only one really aching to get outside into a park, stretch my legs and walk for ages. This is a vegan house and I’m not a vegan so it’s been tough having to go to a supermarket and quickly eat some kind of animal product on my way home (like a cheese sandwich or a hard-boiled egg or a tuna .sh sandwich). My body doesn’t cope well with vegan proteins all the time. When my daughter appeared to get Covid Toe, we did go to a doctor. At .rst, it was her .nger that was in.amed and a GP gave her antibiotics and ibuprofen and antihistamine. But when it didn’t heal, and she had lesions on her toes, we went to urgent care and the doctor agreed it must be Covid Toe. We had tests two days ago but they came back negative. We had to drive 40 minutes each way to a car park where the military gave us self-administering tests. So we don’t know if we did it properly. My daughter and I came back negative. Two others came back “unclear”. My feelings, well, when I .gured out my daughter must have Covid Toe, I did get scared. But then I was reassured that the doctor agreed with me on it and had read the same things I had and so it’s likely just a mild case of Covid. I’ve mainly felt relaxed and living in the moment throughout the lockdown, which has been a lovely change from my normal way of feeling. But then the owners of the house, a week ago, said they were likely to move to Scotland when this is over, to care for her elderly parents. Then I started to get anxious about where my daughter and I might live next. So my feelings are more to do with personal circumstances rather than the lockdown. I am a stats geek so am really enjoying following the daily stats, etc. And I love how capitalism is being interrupted. And how mutual aid groups are springing up. I’ve volunteered for both the NHS Royal Voluntary Service scheme (phoning up a self-isolating elderly person) as well as for a local group to buy a young lad groceries and deliver them. I love seeing how society can meet needs and has the money to do so. The Government I’m pretty livid with the government. I’d been following the epidemic, then pandemic since January. So I knew this was coming and found it criminal the way the government handled it. I believe they were made in a way to kill o. the most vulnerable and to protect the economy. The care home disaster could easily have been avoided. Why weren’t symptomatic people put into Nightingale hospitals? Why wasn’t PPE stockpiled from January onwards, with businesses asked to start producing them back then? It’s astonishing. Seems to me the government will attempt to protect capitalism above all else. Easing lockdown and then needing to reinstate it when the NHS gets overwhelmed. They are also taking advantage of the situation to introduce authoritarian technology, like the contact tracing app which is being developed by criminals who in.uenced Brexit, etc. I wouldn’t trust them with my data. News I get my news from the BBC (website and Radio 4 and World Service), Twitter (reputable scientists), and Dr John Campbell on YouTube, WHO Situation Reports, and Peak Prosperity on YouTube. I generally watch or listen to the daily press brie.ng. I am generally not impressed with it. They avoid answering the tough questions, as usual. I’ve been more impressed with Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ahern. I believe the brie.ngs should be as accessible as possible and am very pleased to see BSL interpreters sometimes when I watch it. Work and Home Life I do not have a job. I am home educating my daughter full time. As I said above, the lockdownhasn’t changed much for the house. We hadn’t lived here but a few weeks before lockdown happened. The 27-year old would normally be going to college to study but is now home. The 21­year old would normally be at She.eld Uni. The man in his 50s would normally be going to dosome freelance wood working. But we never really experienced that, so this lockdown hasn’t felt like anything new for this household. Technology Because I’ve been travelling and/or working from home for so long (nearly 20 years), I’m quite used to online meetings and using social media etc to keep in touch with people. Nothing haschanged for me. Shopping and FoodBecause I knew this lockdown was coming, I did shopping back in February for hand gel (didn’t buy more than a few bottles) and paracetamol and toilet roll. And we already bulk buy organic in this house and already were getting organic veg delivery so it wasn’t too bad. But, eventually, we had trouble .nding .our and yeast. It was strange to be standing in queues outside and to start avoiding people inside. Some shops are better at keeping people away from each other. Like M&S is where I feel safest. A local little shop is terrible and you feel like everyone is infectious and no one is using good hygiene. I’ve had some trouble .nding kale and courgettes, my favourite foods, and that has felt a bit panicky. I know we might end up with a food shortage due to the pandemic plus climate change. It’s all very worrying. Living in this house, our cooking and eating habits haven’t really changed, although I think they bake bread more than they used to here in this house. I would normally go out to eat much more than I do now. Entertainment and Leisure Because my lifestyle hasn’t changed very much during lockdown, the only “leisure activity” that has changed is the amount of Covid stu. I watch and listen to. I enjoy that. Otherwise, no change. Personal HygieneI was already using hand gel before eating out, perhaps for a few years now. So that didn’t change. But I started to wash my hands more. And I started to disinfect things that I brought home from shops. And, when I’m out, I pay attention to which hand is staying clean and which hand touches things and I use hand gel after the shopping. So I’m being very vigilant. I don’t like the way it makes me worry about what I and my daughter have been touching. We’ve been wearing homemade masks out for six weeks now and so that means I also think about touchingthe mask. SleepMy sleep hasn’t been a.ected nor my daughter’s. I did have one dream where I was and there were loads of people and I suddenly realised that I wasn’t wearing a mask! Otherwise, I don’t think I’ve had dreams out of the ordinary. I do dream every night and remember them, but that’s the only one that stood out."

Covid 19 (Update) My health is similar to pre Covid 19, both my mental and physical health remains the same. I’m fortunate that I have had no medical issues prior to or during the current crisis. I feel a bit more isolated than usual as I’m keeping my trips out to a minimum, I miss friends and family. I keep in touch by phone and text but it’s just not the same, so some days loneliness hits hard, but as I want to keep save and virus free so this is the price I having to pay. If I’m busy I’m fine, but some days when I wake I think what’s the point, but then I count my blessings. I think that the government appear to be bumbling through this crisis, there appears to be no real plan. They have tried to ensure people get financial help, which is good, but there appears to be a lot of people falling through the net. Of course these are unprecedented times but there are some world leaders that are managing the crisis better than ours. I think the lockdown was not implemented early enough, the lack of decision making that allowed 3,000 football fans to travel from Madrid, when no matches were being played in Italy, to watch the match in Liverpool appalled me. I watched them marching through Liverpool City Centre towards Anfield and then back, madness. The government also allowed the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, despite the growing number of Covid 19 cases being reported. No wonder the UK now has the largest number of cases in Europe. Going forward I think and hope that the government will err on the side of caution and ease the lockdown bit by bit to see what impact it has, as I find it worrying that we keep hearing about a second wave. Whatever decisions the government make I think that the economy is going to take decades to recover fully. I tend to watch the BBC news at 6pm, I have watched some of the 5pm press broadcasts, but it’s all getting a bit samey, but I do like hearing what the experts have to say, not so keen on the politicians. I sometimes read the news on Google but with caution. There is so much about Covid 19 on TV that I avoid some programmes, I sometimes feel that if I watched once a week that would be enough. don’t know anyone personally who has problems accessing the news. But I do think Nicola Sturgeon is ahead of the game by including a BSL interpreter when she is delivering her briefings. I would also like to see regular use of sub titles. I’m not sure why the government needs to be petitioned to include a BSL interpreter, maybe one more example of the government’s lack of direction. As I am now retired I’m not affected by the problems that face many working age people. But my home life has been greatly impacted by the lockdown. I feel that like many others I’m sure, that I have lost my freedom, I can’t really make choices, I find living on my own is difficult enough under normal circumstances, but not being able to see my family and friends is awful and I wonder at my age if my life will ever get back to normal. The challenge for me is not to over think the current situation and try to live day by day. I’ve always enjoyed socialising; but I worry that I might become reclusive as I can’t imagine a time when I will feel save travelling on holiday or going on a coach trip to enjoy a walk with the Ramblers. I’m finding just going out to shop or exercise very stressful at present as people don’t always observe social distancing. It never ceases to amaze me that people will queue patiently 2 metres apart outside shops but when they get in its a free for all. I’m not sure I’ll ever feel that comfortable in a crowd again. I used to go out most days, now I find myself thinking of reasons why I should stay indoors. I’m used to computers having used them in my work for decades, I have a laptop and an mini ipad, which I use every day, however I don’t really use social media except for Whatsapp, as the likes of Facebook, Twitter etc. just don’t appeal to me, I prefer to get my news from reliable sources and I’m not really interested in the minutiae of other people’s lives. It seems to me that some people use these platforms to either become famous or keep themselves in the public eye, I think that the lines between public and private life has become blurred, just not my idea of fun. Shopping for me is a nightmare at the moment, I find people don’t keep their distance, some people actually lean over you to reach items, and as I know two people both younger than me, who have died as a result of Covid 19 I must admit I now worry more as it seems to me that becoming infected is much more of a reality, so I am now shopping later in the day, during the quieter times, I also avoid shopping from Friday to Monday. I would say that I am eating more, as in the past I tended to skip lunch if I was out, now I seem to be organising my day around mealtimes. Food isn’t that important to me as it’s not so interesting cooking for one. I’m careful about what I eat, but since lockdown I have developed the bad habit of rewarding myself treats, I think it’s due to boredom and I’m sure I’ve put some weight on. I prefer to be out of doors, so most of my time now is mainly taken up with housework. As I’m a very practical person, in the first three weeks or so I decorated throughout, painting all the woodwork and some of the walls in my flat, that was until I ran out of paint. I also sorted out my cupboards and wardrobes ready for either the charity shop or the tip, luckily I have a garage that I can store the rubbish in for now. I haven’t taken up any new hobbies or learnt new skills, but I have read many of the books I have been promising myself I’d read for ages. I am watching more TV and I’ve watched a few DVDs I’ve had for years, the one I have selected for later is called Sunshine on Leith as it’s billed as a feel fabulous film. I’ve also watched The Merchant of Venice and The Jersey Boys. I’ve also been listening to more music; First Aid Kit Stay Gold, Hayley Westenra Treasure and Roy Hamilton the Definitive ‘50s Singles Collection are my current favourites. At the moment I’m reading The Personal History of Rachel DuPree by Ann Weisgarber. It’s about a woman who married and found herself and her family living in very primitive circumstances in the Badlands of Dakota around the time the first world war was declared in Europe. The family’s living conditions are appalling and the book tells her story, it’s probably a good book to read at the moment, as when I contrast my life against hers I know even in these strange times I’m very fortunate indeed. Sadly my exercise has decreased as I don’t go out anywhere near as much as I used to. But when I do I try to walk at least three miles. My personal hygiene is much the same as before, except now I’m washing my hands far more and I don’t go out without hand gel or wipes. I’m a lot more careful about what I touch now, so I use wipes when I touch communal doors or the bins. Extra precautions don’t bother me as safety is the overriding concern. My biggest bug bear is that I’ve not had my hair done since the lockdown and that does bother me as my roots are showing. I have a root cover spray but I don’t like the feel of it on my hair as it makes it feel as if I’ve got too much gunk on my hair and no matter how often I wash my hair it never feels totally clean once I spray it, call it vanity but I can’t bear to see roots, my hair also needs a good trim, I’m just glad I’m not socialising at present. My sleep pattern has changed since lockdown and I’m actually sleeping better. I’ve always had vivid dream, but I’m having more nightmares at the moment, some even wake me up. They usually involve a childhood family home where I find myself walking through the rooms and somehow I end up on open water either on a boat or more frightening a raft, the water gets increasingly rough and ship horns sound it’s usually at this point I wake up feeling really frightened. I have had this type of nightmare occasionally for years but usually only when I’m stressed. Most of my current dreams involve my family and usually it is when we are all a lot younger. I’ve also dreamt about my late husband a lot more recently, but these are always pleasant dreams. When I wake up after a nightmare I read my book or go on the internet to do my banking until feel tired, as it’s usually around 2 or 3 am, bit too early to get up."

Widow  Prenton    Wirral  Retired Civil Servant    Part 1   COVID 19 & Time  I was still adjusting to retirement when COVID 19 happened and I’ve found these last five months very difficult and based on government advice to older people, I began a form of self isolation, so most days seem to lack rhythm and routine.  I feel my life has been totally disrupted, time doesn’t really have as much meaning as it did pre COVID 19.  Sometimes I quite like not having to clock watch, as this seems more in tune with the natural world.  I’m finding that unless I have something I need to do  I’m much more relaxed about routines, I might get up and read for a while, but one habit I can’t break is a shower as soon as I get up.  I don’t mind the queuing at the shops, but what surprises me  is that people are happy to socially distant in queues, but once in the shops  a lot of other shoppers forget to keep their distance.   I try to do my  shopping as soon as the stores open,  as I feel very anxious out of doors, especially in crowds.  I have also found that unless I make a note of what I’m shopping for I often get home without purchasing everything I wanted.  I really miss the pleasure of browsing in shops, I  feel that some people are displaying more selfish behaviour there have been some noisy garden parties in our shared garden and two neighbours have used lockdown to fully renovate their newly purchased flats, which as yet they have not moved into. The almost constant noise from quite early in the morning until early evening has been hard to cope with so, I tried to go out most days to avoid the noise.  Normally things like that would not bother me, I would just visit friends or family, but lockdown has taken this choice away from me, sometimes I feel like my flat is my prison.  I do feel that my ability to see the funny side of situations has diminished, I know  that I don’t laugh anywhere near as much as I did pre COVID 19.   I could never have imagined the disruption this virus has caused to life as we knew it.  Whilst I  want to behave responsibly and keep safe,  I long for my life to be back to something resembling normal and to re establish routines as I don’t feel that my life has real meaning to it at present.  I live some distance  from most of my family and this has been a barrier to us meeting up and supporting each other at this awful time.  The first four weeks were fine as I spent time decorating and clearing out cupboards,  I did think the lockdown was a very temporary measure and I was confident it would soon be over. However as the weeks turned into months I found time hung heavy on my hands.  I’ve tried to develop some routines but that fell by the wayside early on.   I  did set aside time to read more and so  greatly reduced my stock of ‘must find time to read’ books, which has been great.   At first there was a flurry of family and friend’s contact via WhatsApp and text messages But  over the months this has become more a weekly than daily contact as we adjust to the new normal.   I now find that I am eating at irregular hours, probably due to the fact I am less reliant on the clock and I’ve becoming increasingly less organised.  I did start a journal at the start of lockdown but didn’t keep it up. I keep a diary, but mainly as a ‘a to do list’.  I feel that as time goes on routine in any real sense has ceased to matter to me.  I also feel less confident and I dither over making decisions and even when I’ve made a decision I spend time reflecting on whether it was the right one, which is not really like me.  The only positive from lockdown is as I’m spending less my saving have grown.  I live on my own so it is proving to be very lonely I miss my old life, I miss being around the people I love, I’ve not been able to be within touching distance of my friends and family for five months, that makes me sad and gives me a sense of hopelessness.  I feel my life along with that of other people’s is on hold.  But ironically looking back the time appears to have flown by.  I’m finding that there is much less enjoyment in life, the news is mainly gloom and doom, holidays so long in the planning have all been cancelled because of COVID 19, with two of the companies going into administration and I’m struggling to get the money back.   As I’m retired furloughing and job loss has not affected me personally, for which I’m grateful, but it must be very hard on those affected.  The closing of art galleries and museums did impact on me, meaning that I could no longer pursue some of my favourite pastimes.  I haven’t taken up any new hobbies, but I have dusted off sewing machine and caught up with some outstanding alterations and I also made a few face masks.  I have started building up a collection of house plants, which keeps me busy looking after them, one of my cacti a Bishop’s Cap grew the most beautiful yellow flower, it took ages to develop and dwarfed the actual plant so that was interesting to watch.  I’ve also noticed the way the private front garden of my property has been planted so that there is almost continuous colour, not something I’ve ever stopped to observe before.  Early on in lockdown I used to walk in the local  park, I was able to see a lot of changes taking place in nature, trees growing new foliage and creating a whole new landscape, swans, ducks and the geese laying eggs and those eggs hatching.  But it also proved to be a huge attraction for lots of people, one day people were actually queuing to see the cygnets, I found that it became increasingly far too busy so I’ve not been back in two months.  Prior to COVID 19 being in crowds never bothered me, so another pleasure lost.  Since some of the restrictions have been lifted, I’ve been able to re start some of my volunteering work, so that has given some meaning and routine to three mornings a week,  it’s outdoor physical work in a large area where few people visit,  so it doubles up as exercise and I find that it’s very calming and allows me time to forget about what’s going on in the world.    I have also met up with some of my friends and we have started going for occasional walks, usually early in the day to avoid crowds.  Sometimes we share a short story or poems which is lovely.   I do feel that we are fortunate to live in the time we do, at least technology is a distraction and I’m using my iPad far more than I ever did before for things like online browsing and the news.  We are better informed and information is available almost as soon as things happen, but I wonder if these almost instant updates have  created a more stressful world.   I  also ventured out twice recently on a train journey into Liverpool, once for a much needed dental appointment and then to go to a pre booked exhibition in the Walker Art Gallery, but both trips were less stressful than I anticipated and one was very enjoyable.  I have found my sleep pattern has changed recently, I’m waking up a few times during the night resulting in me feeling more tired than usual, but that could be the heat.   I am also very  frustrated by the government’s lack of clarity regarding masks, social distancing etc.  A lot of it seems ill thought out and quite frankly wishy washy,  it would have been much better if the governmental tackled the issues head on in the beginning, imposing more stringent measures and maybe we would have been in a better place now, rather than in a deep recession. I think that this government led by the current prime minister values popularity over all else.  At the moment I feel like I’m waiting for my life to start up, I need to be busy and I miss the  structure of my pre COVID 19 days.   I miss not being able to make plans and feel confident that they will happen.  This has led to feeling that my days are very disjointed and  lack discipline, I’m trying to walk so that overall I average at least three miles a day.  I do at times despair of how life is, but I know that there are people for worse off than me so I count my blessings. I can’t see much changing in the near future, although holidays are being advertised for 2021 I don’t feel confident enough to book one yet.  My whole attitude to holidays has changed, I doubt I will book a holiday in advance again, but instead just book a day or two before departure.  If COVID 19 has taught me anything it is nothing is certain in this life."

In February New Zealand recorded it´s first case of Covid19. In March the case numbers here started to climb and politicians were talking about ´self­isolating´ and ´social distancing´. On 19 March borders were closed to everyone who was not a resident or citizen and by midnight on 25 March we were at Alert Level 4 (the highest level) of the Covid19 alert system and locked down at home in our 'bubbles'. And so started a very peculiar period that I suspect we will be talking about for the rest of our lives. New Zealand has managed to keep virus case numbers low (around 1,500 with 21 deaths at the time of writing this). We are past the (first?) peak and are in the process of moving down through our Alert Levels.  On 28 April the Alert Level was reduced to 3 and about two weeks after that we moved to Alert Level 2 which is where we are at as I write.  Most people can get back to work and school, although there are restrictions around the sizes of gatherings and behaviour in public spaces. Border controls remain in place, and the Government is scheduled to review restrictions on 25 May (after a couple of weeks at Level 2). My experience over the last 2 or so months has been a mixed bag. Emotions have been up and down. In the beginning I felt very anxious and was waking in the night and not being able to get back to sleep. I was worrying about my parents in the UK and when I might see them again. I was worrying about losing my job and what that would mean for our finances. My partner describes me having a ´meltdown´ as the seriousness of the situation became more apparent. I had strange dreams that I couldn´t exactly remember but that I woke from feeling really stressed. A few weeks into lockdown and on the surface the anxiety levels started reducing - I was adjusting, and we seemed to be getting a handle on the virus in New Zealand, and I had dramatically reduced my News intake so I wasn´t living and breathing Covid the whole time. However both my partner and I still had little outbursts: getting disproportionately annoyed or angry about a tiny thing, or just waking up in a really bad funk that soured the whole day.  There was this kind of adrenalin rush because this dramatic world event was evolving, but at the same time my everyday life was very humdrum and non-dramatic so I felt a disconnect between the level of worry and my experience. My partner was onto the Covid story very early, reading stuff posted on reddit from people around the world who were seeing the virus first hand. There were also disturbing videos on YouTube showing terrible scenes from China of people being dragged from their homes to be quarantined and hospitals overwhelmed and mass graves. At the same time I was reading The Times online (we have a subscription) and The Guardian, and they didn´t seem to have much reporting about Covid (maybe just one article a day). But I was doing a little bit of cover teaching at a language school in January (last year I got an ESOL qualification and have been trying to get a bit of teaching experience) and there was some concern there about students returning from China after the holidays, which made me feel that this event was closer to my life. As the news story and the case numbers started growing around the world it was quite frustrating trying to understand what was going on - the information was so incomplete. I was sucking up as much detail as I could and starting to feel like things were a bit out of control. The more I read, the worst I felt, and eventually I decided that I needed to pull back. I have continued listening to The Guardian Science podcasts about covid, for some hard facts about the science. I try to plan my lunch break so I can watch the New Zealand daily briefing, and I have started watching the 6pm News on TV (something we had fallen out of the habit of before Covid as we tended to get our news online). For New Zealand news I have been reading the Radio New Zealand website, and I still dip into The Times and The Guardian online when I want to know more about the world picture. The Prime Minister started doing daily briefings to the media just before lockdown, often with the Director General of Health (chief civil servant at our Ministry of Health), occasionally other Ministers and the Director of Public Health stand-in, and more recently the Director General has done the briefings alone. The briefing is normally at 1pm, and is broadcast live on one of the main free to air TV channels  The New Zealand briefing always has a sign language interpreter (or actually a few that swap in and out). I think sign language is the third official language of New Zealand, alongside English and Maori. Recordings of the briefings are available online, on the government covid website and on the TV channel website.  More recently the briefings have stopped happening at weekends, and instead the Ministry of Health releases a written update on virus cases and test numbers. All the New Zealand case and test numbers and a number of graphs and charts are also published on the Ministry of Health website. I believe that in general New Zealanders are happy with how our Government has handled the pandemic. Reading about what is going on around the world it feels like New Zealand has dodged a bullet. The lockdown has felt very extreme at times, given how few cases we have had in comparison with other countries, but I am grateful our Government has given us very clear direction: we had to stay home and our wages were subsidised rather than us having to weigh up the risks ourselves of whether going out to earn money was worth it. From the beginning the focus here was on saving lives by trying to eliminate the virus completely This was explained as a health  response that would also give the country the best chance economically, as the period where the economy was shut down would be shorter.  It is too early to know if this was the best approach, but I think it has been easy for the country to get behind the message of staying home to save lives, and putting people before profit. As we got towards the end of our initial Alert 4 lockdown there were people speaking up about we should be getting back to work quickly, but I think the progression down through the alert levels has been well handled and I have confidence that our Government is using the best information they have to make sensible decisions. Now in Alert level 2 there is more chatter about whether specific rules are good or bad and about how the Government isn´t doing enough to help particular sections of society or particular industries, but this is around the detail rather than the substance of the Governmetn response. Compared with the New Zealand Government I think the British Government response was too slow, and they haven´t prioritised the right things, and their communication has been muddled. I have been working from home throughout lockdown. I am self-employed and am part way through a 6 month contract which usually requires me to work at my employers premises. On Monday 23 March we were all sent home from the office after a Government announcement about the plans to move up the alert levels. I was told to take my laptop and anything else I needed to work from home, and to assume I would not be back in the office for a long time (ie don´t leave any perishables). The office building only opened back up on Monday 18 May, but will be run at 50% occupancy until further notice. Staff have been split into two groups and are allowed into the office alternate weeks. However, for most people it is optional to come into the office at all, so many of my colleagues have chosen to stay home for now.  Some people are staying home because they are still nervous about the health risk, others because it is more convenient for them. I am due to be in the office for the first time next week after 9 weeks at home, but at this stage will probably only go in one or two days. I am fairly confident that working in the office with hardly anyone there is pretty low risk, but I am concerned about catching a train to get there. I have not enjoyed working from home: I have felt isolated and unmotivated and have found the amount of time I am in front of a screen and on conference calls very tiring. I do not like the way the lines between work and home have been blurred during this period. I have tried to combat this by working in one room (our spare bedroom) and closing the door and trying not to go in that room at the weekends. But it is one of the darkest, coldest rooms in the house and being stuck in there all day might be worse than having work spill out to the rest of the house. I have had feelings of guilt because compared with people who have lost their jobs or whose financial situation is more precarious than mine, I am very lucky, but I am still annoyed by it all.  My workspace at home is pretty decent, I have a large desk and a good chair and can close the door on the rest of the household (my partner) if needed. I was having trouble with just a laptop screen (at work I have two large monitors) so we ordered a monitor online and that has made things easier and me a bit more productive. I have continued to be paid at the same rate for all hours worked, up to my pre­lockdown standard working week of 30 hours. Before lockdown I used to do my 30 hours over 4 days (roughly 7.5 hours per day), and have one day off each week.  Having a day off a week was a bit pointless in lockdown, so I changed to working my 30 hours over 5 days, ideally 6 hours a day, but this proved difficult some days because people booked meetings assuming I worked full time hours, so if I have done too many hours on previous days I try to finish work at lunchtime on a Friday.  As we head back to the office and have more freedom to get around I am trying to move back to my 4 days a week situation. I am currently working in a team of 6, within a larger department of around 50 people. My team has a regular daily 'stand-up' meeting that used to be at 9.30 in the office, but moved to 8.30 whilst we have been at home because no one has to commute and so we were finding we were ready to start work earlier.  We are moving it back to 9.30 now as our routines get more back to normal.  Some of the people in my team have enjoyed working from home because they have found it easier to concentrate, although there has been frustration about the number of meetings some days. We used to have a weekly coffee catch-up when we were in the office, which we have moved online.  We meet via online meeting software (Microsoft Teams) and all turn our cameras on (for most other meetings we keep them off and just have audio) and talk about things other than work.  Some team members like to relocate outside for this (weather dependent), or include their pets. We also tried a team lunch one time, where we sat at our computers with lunch and chatted while we ate. It sounds weird but it was actually nice. We are quite a new team, who only started working together in February, so this online socialising has helped us to get to know each other a bit better.  One of our team had twins last week and we all got to meet them online this week which was lovely and maybe something that wouldn´t have happened in quite that way pre-Covid. I was also on a call this week with someone who I know outside of work (his partner is a very close friend of mine), and his daughter heard me and came on the call to say hello, which was cute and seems to be okay behaviour in current times. Our department has a weekly general meeting where the leadership team makes announcements and gives updates on how things are going. Again this is done via Microsoft Teams which was a product we would use sometimes before lockdown for meetings with colleagues in other locations. We are all asked to mute our microphones and turn off our cameras and then just the person speaking turns on their camera and microphone. Any questions are via a chat session in the meeting software or privately afterwards. Some team members are not very good at following these rules and so we sometimes get to watch someone eating a biscuit, or yawning, or staring aimlessly out of the window obviously not realising everyone can see them. And then there are the random background noises, or the loud typing which can be a bit annoying. I think someone was loading their dishwasher during one meeting! Our department also tried hosting a weekly social  hour on a Friday, to replace end of the week drinks in the office, I have never been to this in lockdown, it just seems like it would be awkward. I am also invited from time to time to meetings with more senior staff for general updates and a bit of morale boosting - 'you´re all doing a great job in the circumstances' kinds of stuff.  Where the attendance is larger some senior managers are using Workplace (Facebook for businesses) to broadcast.  There are regular emails and online posts (on the work intranet) keeping us informed about what is happening around the business the same as before lockdown. My manager said she would be calling to check in on all her direct reports 1 on 1 each week, but I have only had 3 (or 4) calls in 7 weeks. I am not sure if that is because I am pretty low maintenance, or because I am contractor rather than a permanent employee. I think in general the company where I work has been trying to support us all at home, and as far as I know there have been no redundancies, although it will be interesting, as everything opens up and the longer term financial impacts become more apparent, to see if there will be job losses. My partner has his own business and was unable to open under alert levels 4 or 3, so he has only gone back to work this week. 7 weeks is a long time for a business to have no income. Luckily he is his own landlord so he could pause rent payments, and the Government wage subsidy enabled him to keep paying himself, his business partner and his one employee something over the lockdown period. He is now looking at what other Government relief he can access to provide some cashflow while he waits for things to get moving again. He thinks his business is still viable, but it is clear that a lot has changed around the world and it is hard to know how that impacts his ability to make money.  Luckily we are both savers and have a financial cushion that means we are not under any financial stress right now. Our bank has allowed us to reduce our mortgage payments for the next 6 months, and our expenses during lockdown were very low.  I have noticed however that our supermarket shop is more expensive than pre-lockdown. For the first 5 weeks of lockdown my partner was at home all the time whilst I was working, which was sometimes tricky but also less lonely.  He started getting up later and staying up later, and one morning stubbled from bed into my office and a (only audio luckily) meeting.  He was wearing only his pants and asking me what the time was - which was funny in retrospect but a bit embarrassing at the time. Over the first couple of weeks we developed a lockdown routine where we would sit together for lunch and watch the daily new briefing at 1pm. Then I would finish work around 3.30 and could go and do my daily walk, or an online exercise thing. He was doing all the food shopping and most of the cooking. We started having our dinner earlier than normal because we were home, and also started going to bed earlier (because there is a limit to what you have to talk about when neither of you has been anywhere). We have both put on weight during lockdown, from a mixture of eating more and moving less. To fill his time my partner took bike rides (going out for daily ´local´ exercise was permitted here), planned elaborate meals, baked bread and found projects to do around the house and garden. When the projects that it was possible to do without access to DIY supplies ran out and he was bored of cooking, he got grumpy and played online games. Since we moved to level 3 he has been going to his business premises most working days, doing sorting and organising and cleaning ready for opening again. He also stores parts from a car he is restoring at his work, so when he ran out of ´work´ things to do he has been cleaning and sorting those. I think he has enjoyed having time for projects, but has not liked having no income. We have both been keeping in touch with friends and family a lot more than normal, partly from worry and partly as something to do to fill the time. As we live in New Zealand and have lots of family and friends back in the UK we were already using Skype and FaceTime before Covid19 came along. Before Covid19 I would talk to my Mum roughly once a fortnight, via a paid for Skype service that allows me to call her landline from my computer or phone (she does have Skype on her tablet, but doesn´t keep the tablet on all the time or near her to hear the Skype calls coming through). Now I am talking to her 2-3 times a week and checking in with my sister to try and spread our calls out throughout the week, so Mum is talking to someone most days (she lives alone). My Dad calls me via Skype about once a fortnight which is similar to how often we talked before Covid19. He is locked down in England with his lady friend - they were not living together before this. My sister and I would usually talk once a week pre-Covid19, now it is 2-3 times per week with a lot more text messages in between. My partner would FaceTime his parents once a month, but that is more like weekly now.  He also has an Uncle who lives in New Zealand, and they FaceTime fairly regularly normally (once a week/fortnight) - the frequency of those calls has also increased. My brother and I would generally speak via Skype or WhatsApp calls once every few months - but I have spoken to him 4 or 5 times since the start of lockdown. In the beginning of lockdown I heard from a few old friends, and I also reached out to friends overseas. I have been using messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, a lot more since lockdown, to just check in with people with a quick note. Depending on the time difference I might end up having a bit of a chat if they respond straight away.  I have been very careful with the tone of my messages as I am very aware other people may be having a very different experience to me.  I have been having better and worse days, when I am feeling more or less positive about the future and when my energy levels are higher or lower, so I figure everyone else is similar but on their own scale. Most people seem happy for a message and are trying to make the best of lockdown, at least thats what they tell you in a quick chat. There is also quite a bit of joking and humour, about new activities tried and gone wrong, or home schooling/home working problems. A couple of my friends are in pretty tough situations, which is hard to hear about, but there isn´t anything to do except for listen. Early on in lockdown I called my Aunt in England.  I usually communicate with her by email rather than calling, but I was thinking of her and her husband being in the vulnerable category, and also that she doesn´t have any children of her own who would be checking up on her.  She was keen to stay connected with me and my siblings and suggested a group chat. Apparently her husband´s family were doing something like this so that relatives in different countries could feel connected.  After much backwards and forwards another Uncle set up a group that includes me and my sister and brother and their kids, and my cousins and the original Aunt and Uncle.  We have shared some photos of our lockdown walks and home baking, and compared experiences around the rules where we are living and our working or schooling situations. The level of communication on the group has dropped quite a bit since we first set it up. I am finding I have less energy for keeping in touch as the lockdown goes on, and there is so little news when we are all just stuck at home that there is nothing much to chat about. Also as we in New Zealand start to come out of lockdown and life here gets back to normal I feel awkward about being so much better off than others - which is not to say that anyone in the chat is having a particularly difficult time. My energy for most things has dropped off during lockdown.  The first few weekends I set myself tasks to sort through long forgotten cupboards and boxes. I sorted through old photos and letters, and I don´t think I was alone, I have been sent old photos by friends and family that they had uncovered obviously during similar sorting. I tried to get into some stay at home hobbies too: I tackled a few jigsaws and some embroidery; I wrote letters; hunted out my kindle although never actually read anything on it; in the garden I got down to my ready for Winter weeding and my partner tackled some major excavation in preparation for a vegetable patch we have been planning for a couple of years. I went back to trying to learn Indonesian, despite my major motivation for this -a plan to go and teach English there - is not really viable at the moment. Without a commute I was 'home' from work early, and with trying to stick to my 6 hour work days, and my partner not working at all, we started having dinner early (5pm) and then being ready for bed by about 9pm having watched enough TV and not having anything to talk about.  As lockdown stretched out my motivation for hobbies faded and my major past time now is watching TV: Netflix, Lightbox and TV OnDemand as well as a lot of The Chase (UK version shown at 5pm every day here).  I have watched a number of UK drama series that are available via our free to air channels here. I have also been listening to a lot of podcasts, including a few new ones that I have found during lockdown. My commitment to exercise at the beginning of lockdown was really good, but has reduced through lockdown to almost nothing now.  In the first few weeks I was getting out most days for a walk around the suburb (maintaining physical distance from others of course). From our house I either walked down the hill and up another road to do a loop, or crossed the highway at the bottom and walked along/beside the beach. I generally walked at lunchtime or after work in the week, and early morning at the weekend to avoid meeting too many people. One time my partner and I took a walk together, but mostly he preferred to go cycling.  The weather was pretty good for the first few weeks we were home, and I noticed an increase in birds around - presumably because there was less traffic noise.  My weekly dance exercise class was cancelled before the lockdown, but the teachers made daily classes available for free via instagram, and I tried those out 2 or 3 times. I also did yoga a couple of times along with YouTube videos by a lady called Adrienne, whose online classes I have done from time to time in the past. After 3 weeks or so that all started feeling too hard, and around that time our clocks changed and it started getting darker earlier in the evenings. As we moved further into Autumn we experienced a couple of storms that kept me in for a few days and next thing I knew I had not left the house for a week! Now, as the lockdown is lifting there is no real restriction on being out and about walking, but despite meaning to get up and go walking at the weekend I haven´t managed to recapture the initial lockdown enthusiasm for the outdoors. As soon as lockdown was announced I decided I was going to do an experiment to not wash my hair - isn´t the natural balance of oils supposed to return eventually so you don´t need to wash it? I lasted a couple of weeks, at which point my hair was really gross and greasy.  I was rinsing it in the shower, but no shampoo.  I was having to tie it back everyday and was really embarrassed to turn my video camera on for work calls. At this point my partner observed that it was hard to tell if I was wearing pyjamas or not because my clothing was so casual it looked like sleepwear.  I was also showering less, and some mornings would just fall out of bed and pull on something loose and elasticated about 10 minutes before my first meeting of the day.  I usually dress quite smartly for work, although it isn´t required and most of my colleagues just wear jeans. I generally have separate clothes for work and home, but this division had blurred and I was 'going to work' wearing things I might slouch around the house in, but never wear out in public. One day I just decided to wash my hair and I felt really great afterwards and I realised that not bothering to get dressed properly or wash my hair had not been good for me and I felt much more positive for making the effort.  Since then I have been showering daily and washing my hair every couple of days - my pre-Covid normal schedule. I have long hair at the moment, and I usually get it cut every 6 or 7 weeks, so I haven´t minded too much not being able to go to the hairdressers. I also stopped dying my hair a few years ago when the battle against the white hairs was becoming too time-consuming, so I haven´t been missing having it coloured. I am booked in to have a cut next weekend now that hairdressers have been allowed to reopen, I am a little bit nervous about it, but I also think I should try and get back to normal things. My hairdresser called to reschedule after my usually appointment didn´t go ahead due to lockdown. It was really nice to hear from her, although she is not exactly a friend, she has cut my hair for lots of years and it was just good to speak to someone different!"

What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months?The political response has been a real mixed bag, some aspects, the furlow scheme, small business grants and bounceback loans have been excellent but the decision to exclude those shielding from the furlough wind down and the failure to lockdown early, particularly when testing was not available have shown that overall leadership has been really lacking. Dominic Cummings is a disgrace. The crisis has also exposed the real prevalence of yes men in the cabinet . For the opposition Keir Starmer has been highly effective at remaining constructive while holding the Government to account. The government's questionable media tactics, creative counting of tests and deaths also cast a dark shadow. As I write (29/05/20) the lockdown is in the process of being lifted and 'track and trace' being implemented. I expect that the 2M social distancing rule will be relaxed slightly to make transport and hospitality more viable, and the next budget to raise taxes more or less across the board.

I haven't been listening to Radio 4 in the morninghttps://docs.google.com/documenUd/1Qkt4jeWGqoUhqTV7u5fm1a501opxegPp8kutDHSSkYo/edit	5/12as I had been doing over the past year, partially because C is here, partially because the lockdown has played havoc with my routine. I've watched a couple of the press conferences but mainly seen clips on the 6/7 o'clock news, to be blunt I'm not watching them for the most part because I don't believe what I'm being told. Signing press conferences is a sensible idea, particularly for live events. The cynic in me is wondering if Nicola Sturgeon saw one of Jacinda Ardern's press conferences and thought 'that'll make me look statesmanlike'.Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges?I'm continuing my PhD from home, the work has pivoted to incorporate the shutdown of non-essential businesses (in our case pubs) into the research so we (my supervisory team and I) can assess the impact of this shutdown on the brewing industry as a whole. So rather than writing my literature review and methodology I've been interviewing participants and have just started transcription (the files are uploading now, but as the recording format didn't work with the transcription software and the only app which I could find to convert them was on my phone I've had to download the audio to my phone, convert, reupload to onedrive, download to the pc and then reupload to Trint and the internet isn't playing at the moment so it's taking forever) which is one reason why I'm doing this now. (The other reason is I don't like listening to recordings of my own voice). Otherwise I still work one shift a week at the ML	I on Saturdays. I've been furloughed from this so probably won't be back until July when they allow pubs to reopen. Strangely I'm much better off at the moment because I still get my stipend from ARU and because the furlow pay is based off a 52 week average of my earnings and I was working full time before I started my PhD in September I'm earning £173.87 pw rather than -£35 pw, I'm also not spending any money in the pub...Homelife has been fine, C and I have been getting on well, it's just a frustrating position to be in, we just have to wait it out I suppose. No kids which makes things easier, but both of us working at home isn't great for my productivity. We're having more takeaways and sitting outside more but otherwise, its pretty much business as usual.Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like?https://docs.google.com/documenVd/1Qkt4jeWGqoUhqTV7u5fm1a501opxegPp8kutDHSSkYo/edit	7/12	Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and lnstagram to keep up to date or escape from the events?I was using Whatsapp before, I'm using it a lot more now but as I don't use facebook, instagram, twitter or any other social media that's not surprising. I'm in three'covid-19 social isolation groups' one for doing a quiz on saturday night with ex colleagues from the pub who are spread around the country and continental europe, one with most of the men from that group for playing poker on Friday nights (even though I don't really like playing poker) and one with people who I went to school with who are still in Loughborough. These are all good, I've spoken far more to people via these groups and zoom in the past couple of months than I have face to face for years (particularly those with kids). My only regret is that it seems we have to do a quiz first as an excuse to talk. I'm hoping that this is something which we will continue to do intermittently (perhaps once a month) when the lockdown is overShopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same?It was strange when the shelves were briefly empty in the first few weeks, but everything is more or less back to normal, it's been a bit of a relief that our supply chains haven't broken at the first sign of stress and hopefully there will be a significant push to make them more resilient in the coming years. We've been ordering more takeaways and meal boxes but that is mainly because there's very little else to spend our money on.Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading.Some minor diy projects started, none finished as yet. Replacing a fence in the garden, bringing the (former owners) old greenhouse back to life and stripping the wallpaper from one of the spare bedrooms but it's very much a work in progress as we're still both largely working from home.Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this?https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qkt4jeWGqoUhqTV7u5fm1a501opxegPpBkutDHSSkYo/edit	9/12For the most part I have been less concerned about personal hygiene, certainly in the first few weeks I was showering less and less (I hit a personal low of one shower for the week in about week three) It's more or less back to normal now, by which I mean showering on alternate days. It's strange but I think if we had a bath I would have preferred it, just because I would have added a bit of variety. I was due a haircut and a shave probably a couple of weeks before the lockdown started, I usually do my own but I'd been putting it off and was too busy in the first week or two to do it myself so have just been letting it grow. Letting it grow became 'a thing' after about the fourth week, I've never had hair more than an inch or so long so I thought now would be a good opportunity to try it, ditto full beard which is usually very short although very little hair grows on my cheeks it's quite a long now. I can't stop touching it. I'll be keeping them for a while, I'm hoping to have a short ponytail or maybe a manbun by the time lockdown is lifted and I get back to work, just for shits and giggles but who knows? I've taken to wearing an Alice band or baseball cap when it's clean as it is both very thick and very fine and so it gets in my eyes which I'm not used to and don't like, ultimately that's probably the reason I'll cut it off, but you never know...Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe.Some disruption to sleep because I'm not using as much energy, and sleeping in late. Working from home has made me even lazier particularly on the weekends but haven't really changed anything, I've stopped reading in bed, not sure why, although I haven't read in bed since we've moved really, that's something I need to start doing again. C is similar, although her 'work' days are more structured than mine which I think helps. No recall of dreams, I never have any bad ones though, not any more.https://docs.google.com/documenUd/1Qkt4jeWGqoUhqTV7u5frn1a501opxegPp8kutDHSSkYo/edit	11/12"

Since I last wrote about COVID-19 for Mass Observation, staying at home has become quite draining. I find it hard to believe that there will ever be a time where I will be able to see other people again, but I know this won’t last forever. The number of new cases each day here are gradually decreasing and I think most people are now focusing on how the “new normal” is going to be enforced when we are allowed out again. Health Thankfully, none of the people I live with have suffered any major physical or mental health issues during this lockdown period. None of us have shown any symptoms of the virus so far. A few years ago, I was suffering with mental health issues and I saw a councillor at school once a week. Over time, I reduced seeing them to once a month as my mental health started to improve. When school closed, they emailed me to say that they would check in with me once a fortnight, as they are doing with all their other pupils that they see. Emailing them has really helped me to work through any issues that I have and I am so grateful to have someone outside of the family who will listen to me. My emotions have been extremely varied over the past few weeks. I have noticed that they will drop dramatically if I feel I haven’t had a “productive” day. This usually entails schoolwork, reading in the garden, violin practise, working out and writing. I would love to get out of this mindset where I feel that spending an entire day on my phone is a bad thing, but I am finding it very difficult! I think it is because I was working very hard for my GCSEs, and so when they were suddenly cancelled, my brain found it hard to adjust to the fact that I no longer have to do any work if I don’t want to. Since it was supposed to be half term next week, I am not going to do any schoolwork during this time. I hope this will improve my mental health. The Government At the moment, Wales, Scotland and Northern Island are still being told to stay at home, but the British Government is allowing people in England to see people outside their household as long as they are socially distant from one another. They have also said that Primary Schools may open to some students on the 1st June. I understand that they want to get the economy moving again, but I am worried that this is happening too soon. Since we have the second highest number of deaths from the virus in the world, it concerns me that we are moving faster than a lot of other countries. I also think the government is underestimating how hard it will be to socially distance, especially in cities. In the coming months, permitting that the R number is still low, I think that the British Government will open schools in September and allow lots more people to go back to work. However, I don’t think any of this will be full time and I doubt that anything will go completely back to normal until a vaccine is found. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was another spike in cases, especially during July and August when people may think it is safe to socialise again. Overall, I think the government is more focused on restarting the economy rather than saving lives, and already the impact of this has been devastating. News I mostly check the BBC website for news. I prefer to do this in the afternoon so it is not the first or last thing I think about. I find that lots of it is negative and since everything is beginning to calm down I have checked it less. My mental health is definitely improving because of it. We haven’t been watching the daily government briefings, but we always know it’s happening because our wifi usually goes down at five o’clock! My mum prefers to watch the ten o’clock news as it  just gives the main details. I usually go to bed at this time or I lose sleep thinking about what I’ve watched. No one I know has experienced challenges with accessing the news and I believe it’s vital that it is accessible for everyone during these times. I have noticed the BSL interpreters at Nicola Sturgeon’s broadcasts and wondered why they weren’t used for general UK broadcasts. I think they should be introduced as soon as possible. I also think it would be good if the briefings were translated into other languages. It could help people living in the UK who don’t have English as their first language or don’t speak it at all to understand what’s going on much better. Work and home life My GCSEs were cancelled, and I therefore have no compulsory work that I need to be doing. However, my school has put up optional tasks for us to step into our A level subjects. I have decided to only focus on the subjects I am taking next year, which are English, French, History and Welsh. For French and Welsh, I learn vocabulary and grammar and I have also been watching films and TV in those languages. I have been reading the Wolf Hall trilogy for History, as we are studying the Tudors next year and I am currently on the third book, The Mirror and the Light. For English, I have been working my way through classic novels. Since lockdown began, I have read The Great Gatsby, Wuthering Heights and David Copperfield. All of the work has been really enjoyable and I feel like I am making much more progress at home. In school, I had to spend a lot of time doing work that didn’t seem to teach me anything at all, and I definitely prefer to work independently. Lockdown hasn’t had a very big impact on my home life. As I am quite introverted, I like to spend lots of time at home anyways. I don’t think any of the relationships with the people I live with has changed much. My parents can be annoying at times, but I know that they mean well, so I can cope with it. My sister and I get along well, and we do this by leaving each other alone most of the time. If I ever get really irritated by them, I’ll go up to my room for a while. I feel very privileged to have a space I can call my own and it has been invaluable during lockdown. Technology As a teenager, I am used to using technology, but for my parents, this has been a challenge. They have never had a smartphone before, but I have given them my old one so they can be on our extended family’s group chat. It took them some time to get used to it, but they rarely need to ask for my help with it anymore. My mum’s work asked her to trial Google Classrooms with the classes she teaches, and since my sister and I use it for school, we taught her how to use it. My mum made a fake class for us to join and gave us some “assignments” for us to do. In school, we have to use Google Classrooms responsibly, so I took the opportunity to spam the comments section of this fake class! I have been having online violin lessons. I use Google Duo for this, and the video calls have only cut out once or twice. I have noticed that the quality is much worse when someone else in my house is on a video call, so we have been trying to schedule them at different times. My friends sometimes video call me on FaceTime or Whatsapp. It’s nice to catch up with them and there are only ever connection problems when the wifi dips at the five o’clock briefing time. I have always struggled with communicating with my friends online and I much prefer talking face to face. Texting makes me feel anxious and I often take hours if not days to reply to them. Thankfully, my friends are very understanding about this. All of my extended family live outside Wales and through technology, we are now seeing more of them in lockdown than we did before! We have been keeping in touch with my dad’s -very large -family through our group chat on WhatsApp. Many of them live in London and some of them have had COVID-19, so this chat is a great way to check in on them. We have kept in touch with my mum’s side of the family through Zoom. We have done an online “escape room” with some of my cousins and though it took hours to solve, it was lots of fun. We are going to do a second one with them later today. I have been using social media to escape what’s going on. I use Instagram the most, as it is a good way to see what my friends have been up to. My ballet school and my orchestra group both have Facebook pages, so I have been following them for any updates or resources that they share. I have found TikTok to be the best way to completely switch off from the outside world and have enjoyed spending hours watching funny videos on there. Shopping and Food My mum is the “designated shopper” in our family and tends to do a big shop at Sainsbury’s early on Tuesday morning, and a smaller shop at our local Tesco on Saturday morning. We are vegetarian and there has been a lot less meat and fish alternatives available for us, as well as baking goods.  At the beginning of lockdown, the fruit and veg company we use stopped delivering for a few weeks, but we now have our weekly deliveries back again. My eating habits have definitely changed during lockdown. I am now drinking over 2 litres of water everyday, and it has made me feel so much better about myself. I have also been snacking less, as I am using up less of my energy. My sister and I now cook a meal for us and our parents every Friday and it has been fun learning how to cook properly. Entertainment and Leisure By far my favourite part of lockdown is how much more time I have to do my favourite thing in the world: writing! I like to write first thing in the morning, and when I was at school, that meant getting up at 5.30! Since lockdown, I have been getting up at 8.00 and writing for an hour and a half before breakfast. Doing this puts me in a positive mindset for the rest of the day. I now have time to edit my work too, and I like to do this around mid-afternoon. As a result of all this extra time, I am now extremely close to finishing my story, and considering I have been writing it for over two years, this is very exciting for me. Another thing I have loved doing since lockdown is spending time in the garden. I feel extremely grateful to have one right now and I try to go there at least once a day. I have enjoyed re-reading some of my old childhood books, including The Hunger Games and His Dark Materials trilogies and the Harry Potter series. I have also read lots of stories by two of my favourite authors, Hilary Mckay and Jane Gardam. If I don’t feel like reading, I have some scratch boards that I can draw pictures on, and it’s very therapeutic. I am currently doing a big spring clean of my room to make it a nicer place to work in. So far, I have sorted out my wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelves, desk, and storage boxes. Tomorrow, I shall attempt to dust all of these spaces, which I have been putting off for weeks! I have been doing lots of exercise at home to make up for the forty minutes it would usually take to get me to school. Every evening, I do a fifteen minute HIIT workout by myself, and then another one later with my mum. I think my core strength has greatly improved because of this. On the weekends, I like to do a barre work video that my ballet teacher sent me. I have been watching a lot more Netflix since lockdown began. Some of my favourite movies I’ve seen so far are The Breakfast Club, Crazy Beautiful You, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Midnight Sun and Ladies in Black. I have just finished the series Outer Banks and I loved it! It was about a group of teenagers who go searching for gold and it was very fast paced and exciting. I did feel a little sad watching it though, seeing as I will probably be spending my summer being 16 stuck at home instead of having adventures. Personal Hygiene My personal hygiene hasn’t changed much since lockdown. I only have one pair of black leggings which I have worn almost all the time, but I change my t-shirts every day. Since it is getting hotter I like to wear shorts and sometimes dresses, but I certainly don’t miss jeans! I have to have a shower every other day, or my hair gets very greasy, so that routine hasn’t changed. I think I have been shaving more than I usually do, as I like to go out to the garden to tan since the weather has been hotter. I have been feeling much better about my body since lockdown began, as I finally have the time to take care of it properly. Sleep I have always been very lucky when it comes to sleep and rarely have problems with insomnia or nightmares. I am definitely getting much more sleep since lockdown. I got around seven hours sleep when I had school, but I get at least nine hours now. Sleep is what motivates me to work out, as it takes me much less time to fall asleep when I do so. I usually go through phases of having very vivid and crazy dreams for about one week every four months. This last happened in late February but since lockdown, it feels as if they have continued, although they are much less vivid. My craziest dream so far was a few weeks ago when I delivered a baby in Tesco! It was right next to the checkouts and I remember feeling very pleased with myself when I had done it. I also remember another dream I had where I went to the theatre at 11.30 PM with some of my friends from primary school and one friend from high school. We kept stopping off at different places and I was worried that we were going to be late. When we eventually arrived, it was not the play I originally thought it would be, An Inspector Calls, but a production of Grease (An Inspector Calls was the play I was supposed to be studying for my English Literature exam, which my mum and I had seen a week before lockdown. We had watched Grease as a family a few nights before this dream). The most interesting dream I had was last week. I was looking in the mirror and was watching my hair, which was spiky and sticking up everywhere, turning grey! I was very freaked out by this, but my mum who was with me in the dream said that it would turn back again and she was right. I think this was probably symbolic to all the time that has flown by in these past few months."

Although a knee injury has prevented me from doing any walking, which has been frustrating, I have made a point of doing exercises at home as part of the routine of the day. I am sure a daily routine and regular exercise have been helpful in maintaining a generally positive outlook during these strange and uncertain times. Apart from seeking advice, remotely, from a physiotherapist, I have not had to seek medical help. My wife has found the lockdown more challenging than I have and has said more than once that she has felt her mood fluctuating as the weeks have gone on. Some days she has got up, gone for a run, been proactive by completing several jobs around the house such as baking, whereas on other days she has felt completely demotivated and spent much of the day watching television. I would describe myself as being emotionally stable, and resigned to a sustained period of time at home. I have volunteered for extra shifts (as a volunteer) at the local hospice and think that the time spent there is helpful. I meet and speak with a number of people and it provides points of reference during the week; it also breaks up the week for my wife. As a list-maker I tend to note down what I want to achieve and that helps shape my day. The Government The government is in an unenviable position dealing with this unprecedented situation. It seems to me that a number of decisions have been appropriate and based on scientific evidence and trends seen in other countries. Reactive decision making is always challenging, but the attempts to protect the economy seem to have merit and have been broadly supported by independent bodies and opposition parties – a positive sign. However, based on several well researched articles in the press, some of the decision making prior to the lockdown, and in preparation for a potential pandemic, seem to have been poor. Advice from a government advisory panel (2018) about such preparations appear to have been ignored which means the nation was under-prepared as far as protective equipment for front line staff and testing were concerned. These were serious omissions and have had significant consequences for many people. I suspect the inevitable public inquiry will find shortcomings in the government response whilst acknowledging the enormous complexities of the situation, and is likely to be critical of the support given to care homes which have experienced significant problems and do not seem to have been well served by the government. On a scale of A-E I would rate the government’s response as C+. Late to get started but improving as time goes on. Going forward, the government faces enormous and unenviable decisions to support a return to what many people refer to as the ‘new normal’. A balanced approach needs to be made; mitigating against another potential spike in the virus is important, so too providing enough safe space for people to return to work, study and leisure and to advance people towards a modified version of life prior to March 23rd. The transition of children returning to schools will be a real test. The prime minister talks of taking ‘baby steps’ – this seems to me to be the right approach. Babies often have stumbles as they advance towards walking with confidence and surefootedness; we should expect similar going forward. News We have made a point of watching the BBC coverage at 5.00pm, more closely in the opening weeks than we do after seven weeks of lockdown. Like many people I know, I find it frustrating when politicians fail to acknowledge when they have got things wrong or do not answer the questions asked of them. Failure to acknowledge weaknesses over providing PPE is just one example of this. When I see government briefings in other countries – Australia, New Zealand as well as Scotland – there is usually a sign language interpreter present; the same provision should be made for the Downing Street briefings. Work and home life I have increased the amount of volunteering I am doing. I currently do four shifts each week (about 15 hours) at the local hospice and have also applied to be a Telephone Buddy for Macmillan where I would be trying to support one or two people with cancer with regular telephone conversations. By doing so I have tried to support the national emergency situation. In turn this helps me because it makes me feel useful. I am lucky in living in a pleasant house with space and a garden. I also have an amazing wife and we seem to have coped well, albeit the occasional difficult day for my wife – see above. Our children are grown up and living in their own flats – we are in touch with them regularly, especially our son who we speak to daily. We also have a family Skype every weekend to share what we have been up to. I miss not being able to see our children and look forward to when we can be together again. Technology Technology has been important to many people, me included. As well as speaking to people on the phone and via text messages, I have used Skype, Zoom and WhatsApp regularly to stay in touch with family and friends. This has been important to helping me stay connected. I follow just seven people on Twitter – my only form of social media. Shopping and food We have used local shops to purchase food and household goods and supported this when we can with deliveries from one of the major supermarkets. We have asked the local dairy to deliver more goods alongside our bottled milk, such as eggs, carrots and fruit juice. We intend to maintain this support of local convenience stores who have served the community so well in recent weeks. I suspect many others will do the same. We have tried hard not to drink more wine! Not always with success, although this has been good news for one UK vineyard where we have placed several orders for British wine. We have tried a number of new recipes, especially early on in lockdown when certain fresh food items were in short supply. My wife has baked biscuits – delicious! Entertainment and Leisure We have undertaken a number of jobs around the house. The garden has had more attention recently and several over-due tasks such as painting the garden gates have been completed – the good weather has helped with this. I am playing one-move-a day chess games with our son which has also become part of the daily rhythm of life. My son wants us to keep this going after lockdown concludes. So do I. I have watched more television and we opted to purchase Amazon Prime. We are spoilt for choice right now and Thursday evenings have become ‘film night’ when we make a point of sitting together to watch a feature length film – again an important part of the weekly routine. We miss going to the cinema and look forward to the big screen experience when we are allowed to do this. Personal hygiene My daily ablutions are unchanged and form part of my daily routine. I have a strip wash in the morning and a shower at the end of the day. When I was working I used to shower in the morning and evening but this changed when I retired. I shave every other day, unless I am volunteering when I would attend the hospice clean shaven. Sleep I have tended to sleep better in recent weeks and have noticed that my dreams are more vivid, and often about people from the distant past. My wife has also slept better."

In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My response I am 71 years of age. I have underlying health problems: type 2 diabetes, a heart condition called AF and I am slightly overweight because I lead a sedentary lifestyle. Apart from these common conditions, I am healthy. When it comes to wellbeing I consider myself to be good, in ways that most people would find surprising -as I will explain in this response. Health to me, means the absence of any physical condition that has a negative impact on one's life. I mentioned above that I am slightly overweight. The negative consequence for me that arises from this is that it is a risk-factor. I have to take medication for my type-2 diabetes in order to reduce the risk of that condition either becoming worse or of killing me. My weight prevents me from eating and drinking some food products that are common place -such as cream cakes or sugary drinks and foods that are high in carbohydrates and fats. It is not that I never eat such things but that I consume them in moderation on rare occasions and have to compensate for this by several days of eating only very healthy foods. I was asked to share the first five words that came into my mind when I think of 'a healthy body.' These are: Painlessness Energy Sleep Relaxed Contentment In order to be clear why these words were chosen, let me explain them. Painlessness is being free from chronic pain or discomfort. Old age brings aches and pains and these are often related to the weather -such as changes in temperature or humidity. Chronic pain would include something such as toothache that is experienced over many days or even weeks. Energy refers to feeling one has enough vitality to get through the day as opposed to feeling constantly worn out or tired. There are some days when I feel more energetic than others. But overall, on average, I feel I have the kind of energy that I need in order to live the kind of lifestyle I choose. Sleep. I sleep more than I used to when I was working. I cannot get through the day without having a nap during the day. I take a snooze on the sofa and this usually is for an hour. I can do this. It does not interfere with my life in any way. Day-time sleeping benefits my life and wellbeing. Relaxed, as opposed to tense or anxious, is my normal state. I am largely stress free. There is little I need to feel anxious about. Contentment is a long-term feeling of being satisfied with one's condition in life. I am largely content with who I am, what I am, where I am and how I am. Not to be confused with being complacent. Or with being self-satisfied. It is a sate of being calm. I am relaxed about my life. Identity. I said I was 71 years old. I do not see myself as an old person. I do not feel old. I know I am officially elderly but I do not see myself as decrepit. I do not see myself as being very different from how I was ten years ago. I feel no obligation to act my age. I do not dress like an old man. If I look and behave like a middle-class white person then that is because I am a middle-class white person. I am happy with that. It presents no problem. I have completely abandoned 'sexual orientation' and see the idea of having a sexual orientation as being no longer relevant to one's lifestyle. I think it is an old-fashioned and outmoded psychologist's concept left over from its conception in the 1970s. Our society should let go of the notion of sexual orientation and let it fall into disuse along with a load of other legacy ideas inherited from the past. Our society should not need it any more. I would like to say the same for race but sadly we are nowhere near getting towards social colour-blindness. Oddly enough, this kind of thinking does not apply (in my case) to gender. I see myself as being a bloke. I am very content to live in a world of men and women, of males and females. I am very happy to accept that, for some individuals, gender can be transitional. No problem with that. When it comes to being male and masculine I am happy in my own skin. If other people change their gender then they should be free to do so. Those around should respect that it is their choice to decide on their own identity. They should not be disadvantaged as a result. I have always been healthy. I have never been in hospital, as a patient. I have never had a life-changing injury. I have never suffered from a chronic disease. I became aware of health much earlier than I became aware of the idea of wellbeing. In fact I can date my becoming aware of wellbeing as a concept because I happen to have got a job in a clinic where it was a term used every day. That was in 2010. The clinic where I worked (as an administrator) cared for people with a serious disease and those who supported patients talked about their wellbeing. That was when I first became conscious of wellbeing as a word and concept. The more I think about ideas such as health or wellbeing the less I understand them. Back in the 1970s, everyone talked about 'community' in an unthinking way. Social and public services were provided 'in the community.' It was a word that was plastered on everything. 'Community-this' and 'community-that.' Remember Thatcher's 'Community Charge?' Saying that something was 'community' was a deeply and intrinsically political act. Community was plastered on everything in order to make feel people it was OK ­warm and cuddly -whereas, in reality, what was really being done was to sugar the pill of cuts and rolling back the state of public services or, in some cases, increasing prices and costs. The government talked about caring for people with mental illnesses 'in the community.' That was done to make people feel that cutting mental health services was perfectly acceptable. We needed, it was said, to reduce dependency on psychiatric hospitals and to treat people in the community. It was a smokescreen for making cuts and doing nothing. Hence, I am wary about using the word 'wellbeing' as a political weapon. As a term, 'wellbeing' smacks of the same set of beliefs as 'community.' As an idea, it is more than just being well. When I was young, my parents were responsible for looking after me. I left home when I was 17 and became responsible for myself. Being responsible for looking after myself continued until I got married at the age of 33. Having a wife, we shared responsibility for health and being well as a family. That continued until 2003 when we were divorced. From then onwards I became self-sufficient. From 2003 to 2020 I have been on my own. No one looks after me now. I am solely responsible for keeping myself well. My parents had little or no concept of health and certainly never used the word 'wellbeing'. Back in the era of the 1950s, through to the 1960s, people talked only about illness. In the common tongue of those days, health was a synonym for fitness or for freedom from disease or illness. As a child I had chickenpox and possibly measles. I had to be taken to the dentist to have a tooth taken out. That was probably the extent of my parent's having to care for me in respect of illnesses. Conversations about health never took place, as far as I can remember. My parents inherited all the bad health habits from their parents. Sugar for example. My mother used to always put two spoonfuls of sugar in my tea. She sprinkled sugar over everything -including breakfast cereals. I never had a good teeth as a child. I suffered from tooth decay for most of my life because my mother liked sugar. She had been brought up in a sugary world. She had a sweet tooth and it never once occurred to her that sugar was a problem. Her generation was brought up on a sugary diet. Sugar -to them was as harmless as smoking. They probably both had pre-diabetes but I never knew for sure if this was the case and they never said anything to me about their blood sugar levels. Given their fondness for sugar I suspect they both had diabetic conditions but these were either never diagnosed or if they were they never said anything to me about it. My own diabetes was not diagnosed until I was well into my sixties. I do not recall my mother having to take medications for diabetes. She died at the age of 82. Both my parents smoked all day, every day. I remember that when my parents were in their sixties they both had all their teeth removed and had to wear dentures. That was the accepted practice. It meant that people no longer had to worry about the cost of dentistry. It was the accepted medical mantra that people of a certain age should have all their teeth removed. Even today, the removal of all the teeth is still being recommended to people above a certain age. It is something I have refused and will always refuse for as long as I can. My parent's acceptance of sugar as being healthy and not something to be avoided was handed on to me and continued well into my adult life until medical science began to see it as being a problem. I was probably in my fifties when I stopped adding sugar to my tea and coffee. I went to a secondary modern school where I received a secondary education. Health was a minor part of the biology curriculum. We were all forced to take part in PE (physical education.) Once a year, a nurse looked at us. Her main concern was to see if we had infestations (such as lice or verrucas.) One or two of the boys at my school were obese but most were of normal build for their age. There was no sex education. Workingclass boys, in the 1950s and early -60s, were usually fit and not overweight and lived a healthy life eating mainly good foods. All that changed after I left school in 1965 when the food industry gave us fast foods, high-fat and sugary food products and drinks and supermarkets. Televisions came into every home and subjected the whole population to advertising profitable foods that were (as we now know) unhealthy. I learned to cook at an early age. When I lived on my own (from the age of 17) I ate well. I do not recall ever being hungry for long. During my teenage years and up to the time when I went to University, I was in almost continuous employment. Some of the jobs I had (when I was a teenager) were in hotels and restaurants where food was provided as part of the job. When I lived and worked in London I was always well fed and ate well. I also had a job where I was constantly running around and so I did not become fat. As an undergraduate, I ate well and, when not living in hall, was able to cook both for myself and for my friends. My undergraduate diaries are full of references to me holding dinner parties. Our university had an excellent student health service. In those days I smoked a lot and drank heavily, worked excessively and slept poorly. I had 'colds' on a regular basis. Lifestyle 'colds.' Cigarettes and beer took their toll on my health. But I could not have got through the pressures of university life without them. After I left university, in 1975, my lifestyle continued in much the same way as I struggled with demanding careers and high-pressure jobs. I continued to suffer from poor sleep, tiredness and coughs and sore throats. It was not until I stopped smoking tobacco that I became free of these problems. I remember running marathons during the years when jogging was all the rage and nearly everyone did it. In those days the streets were full of people jogging. I think that was in the 1980s. I learned to drive and spent a lot of my time sitting in a car travelling around the country every week as part of my work. When not driving, I was sitting in offices attending meetings and conferences. Two decades of leading a sedentary lifestyle. I also enjoyed swimming and playing badminton. It was not until I retired that I started to become overweight. I ran my own business and spent all day in a chair at a computer keyboard. There was little opportunity, during the day, to go out for a walk or do some cycling to keep fit. Gyms were nearby but they were expensive and I felt unable to take advantage of them. Adolescence Looking back at my adolescence, I probably noticed that I was going through puberty when I was ten or eleven. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was not something we were taught in school. I started to shave when I was 16. That was after I had left school and started going to work. I had to look smart and well presented. Beards or other types of facial hair were prohibited in my line of work. It was not until I was an undergraduate I grew a beard and had long hair. At the time, being hairy was an obligation. I cannot remember my voice breaking when I was a teenager. I probably understood a little about such things because I was a self-taught scientist. I was interested in medicine and human anatomy from an early age. I loved watching surgery and operations being broadcast live, in great detail, on the television. As an undergraduate I studied social sciences and took a special interest in human sexual behaviour. In the 1970s, sociology began to be influenced by the growth of the women's movement and feminism. It was also the era of the rise of gay liberation. And anti-racism. These issues made sociology more interesting. Life as a student offered many moments of self-realisation and constant concern with social change and protest movements. Students began to adopt rituals focused on gender. We became used to talking about 'he and she', 'men and women' and ''his or hers.' As I child, I grew up using the masculine gender to also include the feminine gender. We talked about men as a term that also included women. With the rise of feminism that had to stop. It was no longer a man's world. We began to accept that men and women were (or should be) equal. We also began to accept that people were either straight or gay and that in either case they should not be discriminated against. Our way of talking and our attitudes had to be politically correct and believed that everyone had equal rights. Men urged women to burn their bras and some of them actually did. I lapped this up. It appealed to my political, moral and ethical perspective on life. Some men dressed in women's clothes in order to make a statement about the patriarchal nature of society. Being masculine was frowned on. Men were allowed to be affectionate towards each other. Blokes were allowed to express emotions. The stiff upper lip of British society was dismantled. We left the 1970s and entered a brave new world of social attitudes that was markedly different to that of our parents. I never became a radical in my behaviour because my career was in formal settings where such things would been unacceptable. Privately, I could have discussions with women and men that pivoted on our acceptance of anti-sexism. I was popular with women because I portrayed the 'new man.' Sensitive, emotional and caring. Sharing child care. Changing nappies. Cooking. Helping with the cleaning. Treating women with respect and not patronising them. We actually had conversations about periods and feminine hygiene. Something forbidden to our parents. Men might have joked about women having periods but this was utterly alien to our parent's generation. I worked as a volunteer in the youth service. I remember when we gave working-class teenagers lessons in sex. In doing this, we talked about body parts using the same words the young people themselves used. We taught sexuality as it was and did not dress it up in the terminology of bourgeois liberals who used elaborated words borrowed from medical science. We were a bunch of highly educated liberal progressives who wanted to help disadvantaged young people from poor working-class backgrounds. We were the sons and daughters of the sexual revolution of the 1970s. Growing older I retired when I was 65 and began to receive a state pension. That was a rite of passage. When I was an adolescent I had my fair share of depression -the kind of Sturm und Drang that was and probably still is typical of the middle to late teenage years. Between the time that I started at secondary school, in 1960, and when I left, in 1965, I had a troubled adolescence. I now think of this as my emo era. I received no help for this. None was available. Children's counselling and psychology services were in their infancy and were used almost exclusively by the middle-classes where parents understood the needs of teenagers and were determined to get help where it was needed. As I said before, I left home when I was 17. I moved from my childhood home to London and that was with the permission of my parents. I learned to become independent and self-reliant. It was the best thing I ever did. Life in London was not without its problems but I coped with these and worked hard and gained a place at University. Something not done by any of my childhood peers. I am not convinced that I actively maintained my own health. Ideas about a healthy lifestyle did not really seep down into the British world until the 1990s when we had the rise in running and jogging and the smoking ban and an obsession with eating healthy foods. I remember when television celebrity chefs started to talk about healthy foods and show how people could eat well for less. Gone were the fads of the 1960s and 70s -people started to throw out their old chip pans and pots filled with cheese or oil into which you dipped skewers of meat and vegetables. Landfill sites began to receive hundreds of disused fondue sets. Instead people bought quiche trays by the hundreds.  We stopped frying things in lard and went over to vegetable oils. Supermarkets began to fill up with healthy low-fat alternatives. Advertising and marketing people filled our television screens with foods that were healthy. The TV channels were full of women in Lycra leotards demonstrating aerobics to music. Even men did it. Remember the horrors of Mr. Motivator? All of this came at a time when I was unable to be influenced by it because I spent all my working days either sitting in a driving seat, at a desk or on a conference chair. In the 1970s, running began to boom in the UK. Even I watched the London Marathons on the television. Britain began to see the rise of fitness gyms. I never went to a gym. I either never had time for such things or could not afford it. Running in the street was cheap and you could do it whenever you had the time. Jogging helped me to give up smoking. At first there was nothing better than having a fag as soon as you got home from running. In the 1990s, I worked in local government and my council had a health clinic that offered free courses to people who wanted to give up smoking. I went to one of their group sessions and gave up smoking. That lasted for ten years during which time I never smoked a single cigarette. One night I went out clubbing with a mate and he offered me a fag. By then I was so drunk I accepted it. From then on, I continued to smoke tobacco until about three years ago when I stopped buying tobacco and took up vaping. Which I still do. I do however still enjoy the occasional cigar at special times, such as after Christmas dinner. My fitness regime, during the lockdowns, has been limited to walking in the park. When it is not raining. I do not go out in the rain. Never. People keep telling me I look much younger than I am. Part of this might have been due to getting involved in rock music. I began to attend rock music gigs from 2002 onwards. The bands that played at these events largely comprised teenagers and men in their early twenties. So, from my early fifties, I became a live music aficionado and for several years went out to gigs nearly every night of the week. Most of my friends were men half my age. Gradually that way of life reduced until the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March 2020 when all the venues had to close. But, being a rock fan helped me to avoid the worse excesses of growing older. When I went to gigs, to see bands or rappers, I dressed the part. I wore a hoody and a baseball cap. People thought I was joking when I said I was in my fifties or sixties. I had to explain to them that when I was born, King George VI was on the throne. They had known only one monarch throughout their entire lives ­Queen Elizabeth. Now I seem to be venerated as a kind of elder statesman of the punk and metal scene. One of the advantages of the COVID restrictions is that we now have be seated for rock concerts. I find it hard to stand up for any length of time. A couple of years ago I went to my last outdoors rock festival. No more festivals for me. I simply can't do it any more. To sum up, I am growing old disgracefully. I have no role model in my head for what an elderly man should be like. My ancestors were expected to act their age and to live a life suited to a certain age group. That no longer applies. I think this might be why so many people now live to be one hundred or more -it's not just about the NHS keeping people alive -society has forgotten how to be old. People live longer because they have more life in them. My forbears lived in a world which expected people to die before they were four score years and ten. Elderly people were expected to behave in a certain way and become decrepit if they survived beyond sixty. Most of them dutifully obliged. Getting ready to leave the house My parents occasionally went out for an evening, leaving me at home. I know this because I have black and white photos of them attending formal functions, dressed up in their very best clothes. These photos were probably taken before I was born. When I was a toddler, we had one of the first televisions and my parents tended to stay at home and did not go out much. If I was taken out -to attend a wedding for example -I would be dressed in my best clothes and great pains were taken to ensure that my face and hands were clean and my hair carefully brushed and combed. If my parents engaged in rituals at the time of going out, I was unaware of it, being too young to appreciate that such things happened. When I became a young teenager, I saw my father heading off to the local pub. He did not make any preparations for such outings and did not dress for the occasion. By that time the whole family had gone downhill and deteriorated into slovenlyness. Not my mother, of course. She continued to work as a waitress into her mid-seventies. Her work required her to be smartly turned out. My father wore a uniform -that of a naval officer who was required to observe certain standards of dress and appearance. As a child of primary school age, the only times I can remember my parents going out was when they went to the local public house, just up the road from where we lived. No photos exist of those outings but I know, from having seen old films from the 1950s, that men wore ties and women always wore some kind of hat. The pub crowd was informal but not untidy. That lifestyle changed when we moved house (to another part of town) and I started to go to secondary school. From 1960 onwards, my parents rarely ever went out, at least, not as a couple. My mother worked in the evenings and one adult had to remain at home to look after the young members of the family. But when I went out, when I was a teenager, I paid great attention to my appearance and dressed as best I could in the clothes that I could afford. Going out was a ritualistic experience and it was essential that great attention was paid to one's appearance. When I lived in London, I mixed with society and had to have a range of different styles of clothing to suit the varied occasions I had to attend -from white bow ties and black tailcoats for formal dinners through to jeans and T-Shirts for drunken parties of the bohemian set. When I started work (in 1965) I had to be smartly dressed. Being an office worker, it was beholden on me to wear a three-piece suit. I remember my very first suit -I had it made at a tailors. I think I looked very smart in it. My hair was always carefully combed and cut to an appropriate length -short. My first three jobs were in the legal profession. Smart appearance was de rigueur. After I abandoned that career, I went to work in a travel agency where I served the public. That demanded crisp white shirts and sensible ties. Sometimes I wore a jacket -only the upper half of me was visible to the customers. In London I led a very active social life. That continued when I was an undergraduate at university. When I moved to my present town, in the mid-seventies, I continued to spend most of my evenings out but that was attending political party meetings and committees, more so than social events. Jumping a few decades -now in the Covidian era -social life has all but disappeared. Selfisolation has prevented me going out unless it is necessary. When I have to leave the house, these days, it involves a complex series of procedures that must be planned well in advance. I have a written list of all the things I must take with me before I can shut the front door. From bus passes to face coverings. Before I leave the house, I engage in one specific ritual -I always tell the cat that I am going out. I say the words, 'see you later, cattygator.' She cannot understand human speech, but she seems to get what is happening. You can tell by the look on her face. In future years... I see a time when people stop pontificating about that  meaningless word -wellbeing. My forbears used to greet each other with the words, 'Hello. How are you? Are you well?' There was a standard set of responses. These varied with age. Back in that day, people were either well or sick. Elderly people used to engage in protracted conversations about their illnesses and complaints. It was an expected ritual. We now have a national health service that deals mainly with being ill. I was born in an NHS hospital. Health has become the new illness. This change in language has become most evident in terms of mental illness. It is now no longer acceptable to used words such as 'mad', 'insane' or to refer to people as 'lunatics' or being 'bonkers.'  People now experience mental health issues. We are now all expected to be happy but no one has ever been able to define what that is. People are quite capable of explaining what it is to be unhappy -to be stressed, depressed or experiencing anxiety. During the lockdown of 2020, stress, loneliness and anxiety became widespread as people were denied access to their loved ones and forced to isolate from their normal methods of socialising. Those who ignored the rules of distancing caught coronavirus and became sick or passed it on to their families. Early in 2020, I did a number of courses in coronavirus pandemic management. Out of my own interest. I wrote extensively about the epidemic in this country and around the world. It was, after all, the thing that dominated British life in the post-Brexit era. My knowledge of the virus and the illness it caused went far beyond that of the ordinary person. I might have carried the coronavirus asymptomatically but I have never became ill from it (touches wood.) People will continue to give a high priority to their health and marketing and advertising will ensure that we are not permitted to forget that we must all consume products that contribute to our health and wellbeing. Even after the vaccine has taken effect, we will continue to live in the new normal of a virus-threatened world. We might have faced the coronavirus in 2020 but from next year the world will face new viruses. We will have to adapt to a new normal approach to staying free from disease. As global warming changes our physical environment, we will all face new challenges. Most of the population, in this country, has now become risk averse. Gone is the carefree life that we have enjoyed since the end of the second world war and the foundation of the NHS. Global migration of people has posed a whole new set of threats to our health and wellbeing. As sea levels rise, that will get even worse. My prediction is that, in post-Covidian life, the term 'wellbeing' will fall into disuse and be replaced by more cogent words or phrases to denote how we feel about ourselves and the lives we lead.

Throughout the epidemic, I have not had any physical or mental health issues and have not needed any professional help with either physical or emotional issues. During the lockdown period, from 23rd March, life went on here in my flat much as it always had done. Even before the lockdown started, I lived a fairly isolated life. When the bars, pubs and music venues closed, my life became more isolated. I have not required any medical help and, this year, I have not experienced any of the symptoms normally associated with COVID-19. I am retired. I am not employed. That is not to say that I do not work. I am a writer and I continue to write on a daily basis. That is mostly what I do all day and have always done. I keep myself busy. My day is structured with a routine that hardly ever varies. When the weather is fine, as it has been for most of April and up to now in the middle of May, I have gone for an exercise walk in the large park opposite my home. I also walk to the local shops when I need to get groceries or go to the chemist to collect my monthly subscription. I have underlying health issues including diabetes and a heart condition. Being careful has been important to me. I have self-isolated to protect myself. Over the past few weeks, my emotions have been stable and relatively unchanging. Some of the things I saw on the television news or on social media have made me angry but this was momentary and I soon got back to my normal state of mind. I have not seen any variation to my emotional state over the course of the lockdown. I have not lost any loved-ones to the virus.The GovernmentI have followed the government's management of the epidemic very closely. Every day I watched the press briefing broadcast from Downing Street. I keep statistics so I can have my own dataset with which to examine the course of the disease in this country. Generally, I have been satisfied by what the government has done. I do, however, feel that the government's handling of testing and their supply of PPE has been less than perfect. In certain respects, what the government has done has been too little, too late, in my opinion.Today (10th May) we are due to hear what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has to say about the future of the lockdown. We are not expecting any dramatic changes. I agree with this. Lifting the restrictions too soon and too quickly risks a second wave of infections. Boris Johnson talked about the need to allow people more time to exercise outdoors and that restrictions on this would be lifted and as from Wednesday. People will be free, he said, to take as much exercise as they like, as many times as they wish, during the day. This will allow people to take part in sporting activities with one other person. Two people could play tennis together provided they observe the recommended distance from each other throughout the game. Golf was another sport that could played from now on under the same restrictions. Members of a household could sit together in the park. An individual would be allowed to meet with one other non-household friend or relative in the outdoors provided they observed social distance.For people who cannot work at home, the prime minister encouraged a return to work if it is safe to do so by keeping a safe distance from others in the workplace. Employers were encouraged to ensure they implement measures designed to keep their employees safe. When going to work, he said, public transport should be avoided. He encouraged people to go to work by car wherever possible.A new COVID alert system is to be introduced to indicate the level at which the epidemic is. It will be similar to that use for terror threats. The system has five stages. The country is currently at level four. The first level, coloured green, is where there is no virus. The government's aim is to bring the country down, through the lower levels, to the green one at which there is no longer a viral threat.People in this country are becoming restless and itching to get back to work and to send their children to school. Most commentators (including me) are thinking about the new normal. Life will not return to what itwas in January. British culture and its way of life of its peoples has already changed; even after the lifting of the lockdown, we will not return to the normalities of life as we knew them.Today, 28th May, it is possible that the government will announce further easing of the restrictions and might possibly move down to level three on the new COVID-19 risk state. The government has already announced that some shops will reopen in June and also some schools. The response of the public had been mixed; some people (being called 'new risk averse') are fearful that this could lead to a second peak in the rate of infections. The fine weather in May has seen an increase in people going out doors on beaches and at beauty spots. Pictures and videos have emerged of crowds failing to self-isolate. Generally speaking, however, the British public have been compliant with the restrictions. It is being said by some experts and commentators that our country will be free of the virus by September and if not then by the start of next year. Provided that there is no second wave. This is credible if the public continue to observe the advice of washing their hands, not touching their faces and keeping their distance. I believe that coronavirus will, like the influenza virus, become endemic in this country and will continue to pose a risk going forward. If a vaccine is found and becomes widely available it is possible that the risks of the epidemic will decrease to a manageable level, just as it has done with other viruses. It is difficult to assess how the public will react to the overall approach the government has taken to the management of epidemic. Opponents of the government will, I am sure, be critical of its slowness to act and its inability to provide sufficient supplies of PPE. There will be an ongoing debate about the way that the secondary care system has been managed (or mismanaged) and the government will be blamed for the high level of deaths in homes for elderly people.NewsRight from the start of the epidemic, I have kept a series of my own coronavirus diaries. In these, I have recorded what I have seen on the news, in both this country and around the world. I have also looked into the history of epidemics. In one of these articles, I looked at people who are sceptical about the whole thing and see it is being a conspiracy. When we do start to get mass inoculations, there will be those who refuse them, just as there have been (and still are) those who refuse other kind of immunisations. Some people refuse to have their children inoculated against measles, mumps and rubella. One wonders if this kind of thing will be seen with the coronavirus inoculations. In cases where individuals refuse to accept a vaccine, there could be consequences. Inoculation certificates are already being considered. People who have not been inoculated against the virus could have sanctions applied against them or be refused permission to do certain things because they could pose a risk to others. It is not yet known (at the time of writing) if a vaccine will be found but several laboratories around the world are working to make one. In this country, a great deal of effort is being into the development of a test and trace system; if and when this becomes available, it would allow localised outbreaks to be controlled and this might allow the wider restrictions to be relaxed. I have not been offered a test. I do not know whether or not I have had the virus or have it now.I have watched the news on broadcast television and have also studied what has been published on websites concerning the pandemic. Last month, I did an online course about the coronavirus epidemic produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I am due to start the second part of this course on 25th May. I have also watched a series of movies that feature how other epidemics have been dealt with. Although some aspects of these movies were fictional, their general approach to the topic was based in fact and they presented the issues well, in most cases. I probably know more about the science behind the pandemic than most people, having studied it, written about it and explored it in many ways.Watching the daily press briefings from Downing Street every day (and I have watched all of them) has given me valuable insights into the workings of government and the methods practised by the many scientists who have advised them. A variety of top cabinet members have led these media events and most of them did a fairly good job, in my view, of answering the questions that were fired at them. They worked closely with the one or two scientists that were also there with them. Compare the way our government handled the press briefings with the way the President of the USA, Donald Trump, handled his and one sees straight away how more superior was our government's approach. In answering questions from the media (and also from members of the public) the politicians mainly repeated the mantra set down by the cabinet. Stay home. Save the NHS. Save lives. (The original mantra.) It was always clearly visible on the front of each of the three lecterns. It was repeated ad nauseam. I was impressed by the way that each of the minister seemed to know what they were talking about and by the way that they called on the scientific advisers to add to what they said. The message was later changed to a new one: Stay Alert. Control the virus. Save lives.I have been generally impressed by the press briefings. I have reservations about some ministers not fully answering questions posed by journalists. I fear that the body of scientists selected to advise the government have been ineffective, too cautious and somewhat bureaucratic in their style of working. The advisers have been an impressive collection of professors. They have conducted their work to a very high standard. The downside of this is that opportunities have been missed and innovations have been brought in too slowly or too late.I have always had easy access to the news. I have read the BBC website on a daily basis, watched the television news broadcasts and also listened to radio news broadcasts, daily, throughout the course of the epidemic. This is partly why I chose to write a detailed diary of the epidemic and also wrote a series of articles dealing with special aspects of it. I noticed that the BBC had recently placed a notice on the screen saying that sign language interpretation is available from the broadcasts by the World Service. Not something anyone had thought of at the start of these Downing Street broadcasts. In Scotland, however, appearances by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have always had a signer in the background. Given that the BBC had used signers in many of its broadcasts, I fail to understand why this was not introduced right from the start of the press briefings. I assume that most people could switch on sub-titles on their television, computers or smart phones. That of course does not help blind people unless they have a text reader.Work and home lifeI am retired. Throughout the lockdown I have continued to work, as a writer. I am not employed in this capacity. Some would call it a 'hobby.' I regard it as being my life's work. The epidemic has given me much to write about. I am still producing my weekly coronavirus diary. [See below under Note] I receive a state pension. Finances have not been a problem for me during the course of the lockdown. In fact, the lockdown has has relatively little impact on my home life. Not being able to go out to concerts or to the pub has been what I have missed most. Some of my friends that used to visit me regularly now do not do so; they tend to be people in my own age group who are also vulnerable and need to self-isolate for their own protection. I live alone so I have no household to worry about. I have no relatives living anywhere nearby me. The few remaining relatives that I still have, live miles away. They are not people I would have seen without the lockdown. I do however keep in touch with people over the telephone and via social media. If I needed help I could easily get it. I have always had a plentiful supply of food throughout the lockdown. I have had no problems in obtaining groceries either by having it delivered by supermarkets or by walking to the local shops to get it.My one child is now a grown up who is looking after his own child. Had there not been a lockdown I might have seen my son and grandchild. I do not live with anyone so my home relationships have not been affected. I have been free of the challenges that most other people have had to face during the lockdown. I have been free of the kind of challenges experienced by people living in family groups. I see my personal situation as being unusual and not typical of the experiences of the vast majority of people.TechnologyI was an early adopter of new technology. One of the first who used personal computers and mobile phones. When the Internet started, in this country, I quickly took to it and have been using it on a daily basis ever since. During the epidemic, I have not started to use anything new. I have a smart phone but it is not connected to the Internet. It cannot therefore use apps. This has been a problem on one occasion. I registered to become a volunteer with the NHS through the system called Goodsam. This requires all volunteers to download and install an app. I chose not to connect my smartphone to the Internet. I could not, as a result, participate as a volunteer to help others. My computer does not have a camera. I have not therefore started to use video conferencing. This does not trouble me. I know what my friends and relatives look like. I have not missed being able to see them. I have stayed with touch with friends and relatives through telephone calls, text messages and social media. I use Facebook and Twitter. For entertainment, I watch broadcast television and I have an account with Netflix. I can also use BBC iPlayer when there is something I want to watch. I do not use lnstagram, which is oriented to mobile phones rather than to the desk top computer I use.Many people these days have laptops which have built-in cameras. My technology is relatively old-fashioned. My desk top computer has a full-sized keyboard which I must have as a serious writer. The whole system, together with the broadband transmitter, takes up two large desks, in my flat. It is a relatively powerful systemand it meets all my needs as far as communications technologies are concerned. My broadband has not been affected in any way throughout the lockdown period. There no camera on my computer system. Even if t did have a camera, I am not sure how I would have used It. None of my elderly relatives In other parts of the country have computers let alone video conferencing.I have been well able to keep up with events, follow the news and research learned articles about the virus and epidemics. I mentioned above, that I have already done part of an online course about the coronavirus and COVID-19 disease. I have also watched several documentaries, on my computer, about the disease.Shopping and foodFood has not been a problem for me. I have had a sufficient supply of food and groceries in stock throughout the course of the lockdown. Obtaining supplies of food for my cat has been difficult at times but now I have several weeks supply of wet pouches in the cupboard. The one area that has been a problem for me has been finding delivery slots on the main supermarket websites. Early on, I was registered as a vulnerable adult under the NHS system. This information was passed to the main supermarkets that I use. Even so, I found it difficult to get delivery slots when I have tried to order groceries on line. The one supermarket that gave me dependable delivery slots was Iceland. So far, I have four deliveries from this source.Much of the day-to-day food I need, I get from local shops that are within easy walking distance of my home. From these local shops I have also been able to obtain disposable gloves and face masks. I have made good use of these. I doubt that wearing a face mask afford me any protection and, because I do not have symptoms, I doubt I am infectious. Wearing a face mask is more to do with setting an example and showing sympathy with others during the lockdown.During the lockdown I have eaten well. There have been no changes to my diet. I have put on a little weight but that it due mainly to taking far less exercise. I regular takes walks in the park but I have not been doing exercises at home. I do not have a bicycle. Before the lockdown I used to go to the gym. This has not been possible for a long time. I consume a varied diet and need to as part of my management of blood sugar and cholesterol, both of which can be a problem for me. I have a heart condition and take medication on a daily basis for this.Many of the local shops I visit are cramped. It is not possible to stay two meters away from other customers. In one local supermarket I have had to queue to get in. Not for long in most instances. In another store I have never had to queue to get in. When t get home with tins, jars and packets, I wash my hands and then put on a pair of disposable gloves to handle the products. Before I put my groceries into the cupboard, I sterilise them with a strong alcohol fluid (surgical spirit BP) and any fresh fruit is washed in hot soapy water. I used the Internet to search for information about the length of time the virus remains active on a variety of different surfaces. When ever I go out to a shop or to the chemist I always wear gloves. When I arrive home I wash my hands and sterilise anything I have brought back. Even when letters drop through the postbox, I wear disposable gloves to open them. Plastic carrier bags that came with the online deliveries were sterilised or quarantined before using them. I believe that some items can be quarantined for 72 hours before being handled.Entertainment and leisureMy day has fallen into a largely invariable routine. As soon as I get up I switch my computer on and start working on my writings. I switch on the television in time to watch the Downing Street briefing, usually at around five o'clock. I never watch broadcast television before that time. When the six o'clock news comes on, I eat my dinner. By seven o'clock, most of what I am interested in has finished, so I can put off the TV and read a book. At 21:00 I put the television back on if there is anything worth watching. If not I do some more writing, watch iPlayer or Netflix. Everyday I watch my choice of movies or series on Netflix, before going to bed. I have occasionally watched programmes using BBC iPlayer during the afternoon. This is rare but there have been times when I have tired of writing.I tried to take up painting as a hobby, during the lockdown. I took out my stock of paints, brushes and paper and did one session of painting. Since then, I have not gone back to it. Having a demanding programme of writing to do, I feel I am not short of a programme of work and certainly have not felt I have a lot of spare time on my hands to pursue hobbies. I live in a rented apartment; there is therefore no need for me toengage in DIY. The one time when an urgent repair job was needed, I phoned the landlord and it was done the same day. A workman was found and he came and did the job within a couple of hours. This surprised me; I thought It might have taken a lot longer than it did. I do my own cleaning. Nobody comes in to my home to provide me with services of any kind. When it comes to domestic duties I am self-sufficient. If small problems occur in the flat I can nearly always fix them myself. My cupboard has a supply of tools, spare parts and cleaning fluids should I need them. Living as I do on the top floor of an apartment block, I have no garden. I have some house plants and a house cat to look after.During the lockdown I have not learnt any new skills. I have gained a lot of new knowledge. Especially about virology and disease control. I never play games. Not any kind of games, in any way, shape or form. I have taken walks in the big park next to where I live, when the weather has been fine, but this has not always been possible. There have been days when I have had to wait at home for deliveries. I could have done exercises at home, indoors. But so far I have not. Most of my daily exercise is gained from doing cleaning and domestic chores. Since the start of the lockdown, I have been largely self-isolated and have had no visitors to my home. This has not been a problem for me. As I said above, my way of life has not changed much since before the lockdown started.My principal diet of television is watching documentaries. Sometimes there are movies broadcast that are worth watching. Occasionally, there are comedy programmes that are bearable. Have I Got News for You is one of my favourites. I am very selective about what I watch. Very picky. I know what I like and what I do not like. And I will not watch television programmes for the sake of it. Over the past few days I have greatly enjoyed the 'Shakespeare in Quarantine' series on BBC iPlayer. King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice. All done by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Very entertaining.Very enjoyable. And there is Netflix. The adventures of Merlin. The Medici. Devs. The Last kingdom. The OA and now Ex Machina. These are what I head for on Netflix. When I want to listen to music, I play it on YouTube. There are plenty of interesting films on the Internet, if you know where to look. There have been days when it has been difficult to find suitable entertainment but, generally speaking, these have been few and far between. I am reading David Copperfield by Charles Dickens. This book arrived in February and I am now about half way through it. I order all my books online through a specialised bookseller. I am never short of reading material.I have read a succession of books during the lockdown. I am working my way through David Copperfield. At the same time I am also reading Joyce: A portrait of the Artist as a young man. I recently finished a couple of novels by Kafka. Not sure why I got those but, having purchased them, I felt obliged to read them. Very strange stuff. Not what I expected. One does not read Kafka for pleasure. His work is not entertaining. I did get a lot of pleasure from re-reading my first novel, correcting the typing errors as I went through the manuscript. It provided a delightful story about a group of English teenagers who go on a package tour of Italy. It made me laugh; it made me cry. I just wish it could be published. My daily programme of work engages me in writing and editing my own material. My spare time is limited. I have never been bored.Each evening, when I get into bed, I put on the World Service of the BBC and listen to the business programme. If I get into bed early enough, I can listen to the shipping forecast. It is always preceded by a piece of music called Sailing By. I know every note of this piece and so does my cat. We have listened to it hundreds of times by now. I even have a map of the shipping areas around British coastal waters stuck on the side of the chest of drawers next to my pillow. Now I know the location of many of them. The radio, as broadcast by the BBC, is an odd British tradition. They always play the national anthem at the end of the broadcasting day. It helps me to fall asleep and it goes off when the timer runs out.Personal hygieneDuring the lockdown I have washed my hands over twenty times a day. My hands have been very clean. The problem is that I have developed sore patches at the base of my fingers due to not having dried them properly. I went to the chemist to get something to treat these sore patches. I have also taken to wearing rubber gloves when doing the washing up to protect my skin. I use antibacterial washing up liquid; it will not protect me against viruses but it will protect me against the risk of picking up bacterial infections which would pose a risk to my health if I did become infected by the coronavirus. Being at home all the time I have not shaved as much as I did when I went out on a regular basis. I have become lazy about my personal hygiene. Not being in the presence of other people has lead to me being less conscientious about my personal hygiene. I am the only person here and the cat does not mind if I smell a bit. It takes me a long time to go tothe shops. I feel the need to shave and wash before I go out to get groceries.I never used to clean the groceries before I put them away. I do now. It is possible that those who put the tins on the shelves, at the shop, could have infected them. The virus does not survive for long on such surfaces but one cannot be too careful. Better to be safe then sorry.During the course of the lockdown my personal habits have not change much. It has been a case of more of the same. If I do go out doors I always wash my hands when I get home or I sterilise them with an alcohol solution. I have always complied with the restrictions imposed by the government.SleepDuring the lockdown, my sleep has not been affected. It is only now, at the end of May, that sleep has become difficult but that is because of the hot weather and would have happened had there not been a lockdown. I have not experienced much in the way of anxiety and stress and have not experienced depression during the course of the restrictions. Isolation has not affected me mainly because I had already got used to it before the outbreak of COVID-19. I have had a few episodes of insomnia. I have no idea why these occurred. It might have been because I spent too long sleeping during the day. I have not had nightmares caused by the epidemic. I dream a lot and many of these dreams have been interesting. It it just my mind working through the stuff that minds work through. Nothing to do with the coronavirus. More often than not my dreams are related to what I have been watching on the television or on Netflix. When I do find it difficult to get to sleep at night, I listen to the wireless. Hot weather affects my sleep worst. I used to have nightmares about nuclear war but I was a lot younger then. I lack any sense of personal fear about the epidemic. I am not anxious about it. I avoid taking silly risks but otherwise I am complacent about the whole thing. So many people have died from COVID-19 - 37,460 to date. That is a lot of people who have lost loved ones. I feel the pain of the British people but death is not something that has affected me pesonally.NoteAs I said above, I have written a series of coronavirus diaries. I will send copies of these to The Keep when they are finished.Please post your response to: Freepost: RTGU-AYJE-YSSC, The Mass Observation Archive, The Keep, Woollards Way, Brighton, BNl 9BP."

The Government I am writing Part 2 two days after Boris Johnson’s TV address to the nation (May 10). I am of the opinion that in January last the Government was too slow to take the necessary action to mitigate the effects of Covid-19, therefore people have died, many prematurely. I fully support the lock-down and have applauded front-line workers, whatever their occupation. In the light of Boris’ latest ‘stay alert’ exhortation, I expect news of a second wave of the disease resulting from a slight relaxation of the ‘stay at home’ lock-down’. News I read the Daily Mail and watch evening TV news bulletins – Granada, ITN, and Channel 4 news – Monday to Friday. I have no particular opinion with regard to Government press broadcasts. Sign language interpreters are necessary to keep deaf people informed. It is singularly noticeable that Wales, Scotland and Ulster briefings do employ sign language interpreters, but not England, for some reason. Home Life As a retired person, aged over seventy, I have remained indoors except for daily exercise in the form of walking with my wife. Technology I am completely indifferent to the new forms of technology. I do not keep in touch with friends via Facebook, Twitter, or any other tools designed to connect with remote platforms. Shopping and Food My wife undertakes the shopping for groceries at the local supermarket. On the last occasion she found that queuing before admittance very inconvenient. She has taken to buying fresh fish by telephone at a local fish supplier. Meals have stayed the same, based on healthy and appetising menus. Entertainment and Leisure We have arranged nothing special to entertain us. We read and watch TV in the evenings. Covid-19 has not impinged on our usual activities both indoors and in the garden. Yesterday evening a broadcast entitled Hospital was shown on BBC 2, depicting one day in a London hospital as staff tried to deal with a shortage of oxygen and very ill patients. Personal Hygiene Hand washing immediately on arriving home from a shopping exhibition. Handrails, door handles, wheelie bin grips, and even the steering wheel of the car receive attention, courtesy of cleaning with antiseptic cloths. Sleep I suffered from bouts of insomnia before the onset of Covid-19, so to have them now is just a continuation of the condition. Dreams are vivid and often unpleasant if not ranking as nightmares. My wife rarely speaks of dreaming. She is always there when I wake up upset by an unpleasant dream. My dreams are varied in content and often place me in an disadvantageous position. I don’t relate my dreams to Covid-19."

I have never had a lung infection that bad, and at one point Ithought I’d be left with permanent lung damage. Fortunately I recovered well, although I do still have tired days. This experience meant that Iwasn’t scared ofcatching Covid19 as I may have already had it – however I was annoyed there was no way of finding out, as there was no testing for the general public. In terms of mentalhealth, I alreadyhave a ‘mentalhealth toolkit’ as I amprone to depression, so I continued life as usual, making sure I exercised regularly, ate and slept well, kept to a routine, contacted friends regularly etc. My pets are a reason to get out of bed every morning, I have not had a day without getting dressed, have not massively overeaten, and have had no severe anxiety. In fact, to alarge extent, lockdown suits me as I don’t have the pressures to be social and the stress of keeping a public life going. I have needed no medical or professional help. I attended a dental appointment for repair of a broken filling plus X-rays the day before lockdown took effect;I told themI’d done 2 weeks in self-isolation and was now symptom-free, they were happy for me to come in, and I was comfortable with their hygiene precautions. I’mglad I did, given how long this has gone on for… initially wewere told 3 weeks, then extended another 3 weeks. I have had the feeling since the start that this would go on a lot longer than people expect, having followed the science news since January and read about what was happening in other countries. My emotions have been up and down. Days of perfect contentment, in the garden, in the sunshine, hearing birdsong, knowing that nature has a chance to recover, quiet streets, long walks, people caring for each other in local communities; but also days when it was an effort to get out of bed, nights when it was hard to get to sleep and/or I woke several times, anxiety dreams often involving travel, general grumpiness and unsociability, bad and sore tummy, lethargy. Catching myselfgoing down the routeof‘I’museless’ and changing direction quickly (been there too many times in my life already). Some anxiety about the future, more along the lines of ‘what should I be doing in the next few years’ rather than ‘is this Armageddon/zombie apocalypse’! The Government Have made an almighty balls-up of the whole affair, on top of the criminal policies of previous Tory administrations! Ideologically-driven decisions, along the lines of keep the country open for business (untilit’s too late to contain the outbreak), U-turns, the realisation that the NHS is the lynchpin after so many years of underinvestment, running it down and privatising-by-stealth… So many lives lost unnecessarily, I amashamed of our country. Too little, too late, bluster, obfuscation, Boris Johnson and his administration are totally out of their depth in the crisis. I see the measured and calm leadership in other countries and despair. In the coming months, sadly, I see more of the same. Partial easing of the lockdown is starting to occur as of this week, but the message is confusing and the other countries of the Union are having none ofit. ‘Be alert’? I have no faith that we will avert a second and potentially much larger spike in cases and deaths. I am very concerned that BME people and poorer people are bearing the brunt of this. The working class are once again merely cannon fodder. All I can hope for is that the Tories are removed sooner rather than later and that the next Government, be it Labour or some sort of coalition, listen to all the sciences properly and rebuild with people and the planet in mind, not making money for big business and shareholders. We have the opportunity now to re-green the economy and make it work for all, not a very few at the top. I can only hope we take it. News I sometimes watch BBC News at 6; I sometimes buy an i newspaper; I get my science news from New Scientist, which I read on my tablet every week via a library app, and from other forward-looking science email newsletters. Sometimes I click on reports that appear in my Facebook newsfeed, eg Guardian articles posted by others, but several news sources overall. I avoid the Right Wing press even on newsfeed though. I have not been watching the daily government press broadcasts at 5pm, relying on clips on the 6pm news rather than have to endure Raab and Johnson taking the stage fully. I have not experienced any challenges with access to the news and don’t know anyone who has. I was impressed withNicola Sturgeon’s briefings and think sign language interpreters are a good thing in general. More inclusivity! Work and home life I have two sources of income from paid work normally, one of which has continued and the other came to an end before lockdown but can’t be restartedwhile all this is going on. The one that has continued is my part-time work as PA/Carer for a man with autism who gets Direct Payments to employ me. He is very anxious about the pandemic and is taking extreme measures to avoid infection. I am in contact withhimdaily, keeping up our ‘coffee dates’ on Tuesday by phone, and I get shopping for him once a week and deliver it to his house, using disposable gloves and keeping my distance. If the weather is OK we then walk his dog round nearby fields, physically distanced. He heard from the Agency or Social Services that he was to continue paying me as usual even if the hours had to drop due to the crisis, so that is a relief for both of us. However, it is not enough to live on. I am very fortunate that I have some savings to fall back on. My major source of income is as a Supported Lodgings Provider for Somerset County Council Social Services, for teenagers leaving care. My most recent placement came to an end in February, meanwhile my youngest daughter returned from studying in the Netherlands while she was applying for MA courses and finding work placements, and she started doing some temporary agency work until the first placement started. She was due to be working with Youth Empowerment schemes in Bulgaria starting in April. Meanwhile I was going to do major redecoration and work internal to the house before my next lodger placement. All that has fallen apart. Daughter’s work closed down and she had to sign on, but has not yet received any money, so I’ve been supporting her financially. She has applied to do online TEFL workbut there were manyhoops to jump through and that hasn’t started yet. No workmen will enter the house so nothing moving on the home improvement front. And daughter is stuck here indefinitely, in the bedroom I intend to use for lodgers. I miss my grandsons the most. I was a regular carer for them before this hit – they are both pre-school and the youngest is not yet talking, so it is hard. Ican’t see themat a distance as they don’t really understand whyI won’t come near them. We do video chats, at least. My son and his girlfriend are in Bristol; I am fortunate that I have one at home, at least, totally by fluke. Otherwise she would have been in the Netherlands, possibly without an income. We get on fine in the house, both fairly easy-going and we keep to our own rooms a fair bit. Technology I watched friends setting up Zoom to do online classes and meetings, but didn’t feelI had to initially. I did an online attempt at singing with members of one of my choirs for a birthday gig we’d had to cancelin April, but it didn’t work – for that I used mydaughter’s laptop and she set it up. Now however I need to set up Zoom on my laptop for a committee meeting for my other choir, which is tomorrow. We did a practice last week to make sure we could all access it. I’m not comfortable with online meetings or technology in general, although I can get used to it fairly quickly if I have to. However, I do use Messenger on my phone, both video calls and for voice-only calls, to see family and occasionally one friend. I have returned to actual letter-writing, especially initially, and written to distant friends and one in Australia and phoned old friendsI’ve not seen for a long time including an ex-boyfriend. I use Facebook but not Twitter or WhatsApp. I find myself scrolling the newsfeed several times a day, to keep up with locals and get reports from elsewhere in the country. In many ways it is a comforting ‘bubble’ ofpeople who agree with me or share a similar outlook, but I am aware of a lot of fallings-out and polarisation occurring. De-friending is trending… Shopping and food I have not bought any food online. I do a shop once a week, for myself, a neighbour who is self-isolating and my employer/client. My daughter comes with me and also shops for another self-isolating friend. That makes the supermarket experience into a bit of a challenge as we both have lists and need to find items which are unusual to us. The local Morrisons has been fine most weeks, flour is still rare but no shortage of fresh vegetables and fruit and most other items after the initial toilet roll rush. Whether there is a queue to get in depends on time of day, and people are all complying with distancing rules inside and to reach the check-outs. One week I attempted Tesco’s for my employer, and it was a horrible experience, not to be repeated. Long queues to get in, a strict one-way policy and long queues to get out, all the while ‘public service’-style announcements adding to my stress with a flavour of doom. I have a neighbour who shops at Aldi, also local, so she gets anything I particularly want from there. I know many neighbours and we look out for each other, swapping savoury dishes and cakes. There is a corner shop up the road which I use occasionally – for the newspaper, milk if I run out, and their discounted fruit and veg. There is also a farm-shop-type stall on the road near the bypass, within walking distance for local milk, eggs, butter, cheese etc, and I drive by on my way to the supermarket to pick up bags of compost for my seedlings. The Co­op on the High Street is also walking distance – I have only had to use it once when the corner shop had no newspaper, but I did find white bread flour there which another friend was desperate for. We are a small town in a rural area. Neighbours have allotments. People keep chickens. We won’t be short offood. My cooking and eating habits have changed because a) daughter is at home and likes to cook, and b) neighbours drop food in as a way of keeping in touch. I am eating more cake than usual! Other daughter has also been baking regularly and we do doorstep swaps, seedlings/clothes/cakes etc. Entertainment and leisure I stilldon’t watch muchTV, and ifI do it is alwaysBBC iPlayer. I have radio 3 on a lot and have once forayed into radio 4 territory. I have kept up my language learning on the Duolingo app on my tablet – started before this struck, Greek, Dutch and Spanish. I try to do some lessons every late afternoon or evening but will sometimes miss a day. I read and do Sudoku and have done a lot more gardening than usual. I read magazines on my tablet through a library app, New Scientist every week, and monthly BBC Wildlife, BBC History, BBC Science Focus, National Geographic, and occasionally others. Once a week I read the i newspaper. A neighbour drops in old copies of LRB for my animals’ bedding and I willalways read them first. I do sudoku from a book of them in bed when I wake up and as I go to sleep, and sometimes but not often during the day (usually the ones in the newspaper or free publications that come through the door) – I find it soothing, part of my stress relief. I have been listening to my old LPs some days, the turntable is a fairly recent acquisition so I still have a lot to work through after many years of them being stuck in the attic. I text or phone friends regularly. I go for a walk every day, sometimes over an hour but generally 20 mins to half an hour. I have done some unaccustomed cleaning, but not enough. Starting off seeds and repotting seedlings, hardening them off, planting some out, has kept me amused more than usual, also weeding, mowing, animal care (guinea pigs and quail). I have also done kitting, lots of overdue clothes mending, and some tapestry. I exercise at home some days, probably not often enough. Before, I went to a gym and attended yoga classes once or twice a week. I’ve not wanted to do Zoom yoga. Ido some weights exercises and some jogging around the house, but my main exercise is my daily walks or digging beds for vegetables/weeding. Once I went for a bike ride after my daughter (or rather, me) bought a second-hand bike, I aim to do this again. In terms ofTV, I’ve been watching Killing Eve, end of series 2 and all of series 3 so far; Primates, a new wildlife series, waiting for the next episode; started In My Skin but given up after 4 episodes I think; Back to Life; series 3 of The A Word. Initially I was watching BBC news at 6everynight, but now it’s occasional. I don’t watchTV everyevening, probably no more than 3-4 nights a week. I don’t listen to podcasts. Ialways have radio 3 Breakfast on from 7.30-8.30 with my alarm, sometimes I continue with it, also the afternoon or weekend shows. I like background classical music and familiar voices. I read a lot of novels and some non-fiction, depending on what I find or what neighbours lend me. The main one to note is HilaryMantel’s The Mirror and the Light, the 3rd from her Wolf Hall trilogy, which took me over 2 weeks to read. I like literary fiction and historical detective novels but will read a wide range of material. Personal hygiene I have kept to a fairly strict routine, not much different to everyday life before this. A shower and wash hair every third day; clean teeth twice a day; moisturise every morning. I started to wear make-up when I went out in the initial weeks, unusually, but have dropped that now. I get up and get dressed every day, although getting dressed is sometimes later – it is now after 10am and I am typing in my pyjamas, for example, but I will get dressed as soon as daughter is out of the bath… I don’t miss haircuts or personalcare appointments as I rarelydid them anyway. Hair gets trimmed twice a year usually, Iwear it long and curlyor tied back if it’s in the way. Sleep I do not have insomnia or nightmares, but I have been waking up in the night more often, have been taking much longer to get to sleep sometimes, and have been finding it harder to wake up and get moving at times, with more vivid and narrative dreams often including elements of travel, of anxiety, of people I know who died, of childhood scenes and places and of current events, all mixed up together. For example this morning I dreamt that I was pregnant with my ex-boyfriend’s child but in atime ofCovid19 (I amseveralyears post-menopausal)."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health The worst week for me was just before lockdown started when my mum was really unwell: I was very fearful about her health – it wasn’t certain if it was Covid or not (she didn’t get a test) but I was panicking that if she was seriously unwell then the Covid situation would prevent her from seeking/accessing help – or it could have been Covid. Her symptoms were extreme dizziness, nausea, generally feeling unwell and feeling out of breath when trying to get out of bed and move around the house – but no cough or other Covid symptoms. I’ve not hadtoseek medicalhelpexcept for a phone appointment withmy GP forfeeling generally fatigued and unwell over the past few weeks – she recommended getting some routine blood tests done to check for things like anaemia, butI’ve notmanagedtogetthesedone due tolackofaccess to routine phlebotomy services. My emotions have been heightened: sometimes feeling sad, frightened and pessimistic – and at other times very stressed, irritable, even panicky about my own health at times. Other times I have felt happy, grateful and appreciative of the good things in my life, and motivated/determined. The Government I think the UK has handled this situation fairly badly, but even more so due to the austerity measures over the last few years than the actual crisis – ie the NHS has been chronically underfunded, services cut to below a safe minimum, a serious lack of nursing staff, pressure on doctors, lack of GP’s etc – and bad decisions made about PPE stockpiling and pandemic preparation. We also did not enforce a rigorous lockdown soon enough (or extreme enough) and failed to learn from/prepare when we had a chance – it felt like the government were complacent and seemed to think the virus would magically stay away from the UK! I think the lockdown measures are ending too soon give that we have no robust test/track/trace system in place – it’s bound to lead to another surge of infections and deaths, disproportionally affecting low-paid workers and people who are being forced back to work while wealthier people or those in certain industries can continue to take time off or work from home. I think the government will be forced into putting lockdown in place again; either that or find a way to invest far more heavily in testing/track/trace measures as other countries have done. News I’ve been on the Guardian website several times a day on my laptop and phone – compulsively at times, but then at other times I’ve had to limit my viewing/reading as I’ve felt too depressed/worried/frightened from seeing too much. I work in healthcare so partly want to be informed as much as possible – but also I find it really hard reading the details of people working in Covid wards/hospitals as it all feels too close to home. M-O Number: H6109 Female, 42, single, Bristol Mental health nurse I continue to buy the printed copies of the Guardian and Observer at the weekend. I have not been watching the daily broadcasts or experienced any issues in accessing news. Work and home life Work: I work as a mental health nurse on an eating disorders unit. I was desperately worried that we would end up being closed and redeployed – which would have been my worst nightmare: the acute admissions ward on site with us became the ‘Covid ward’ for the acute inpatient service trust-wide, and it was a possibility (if our unit had closed) that I might have ended up having to work there. I feel very lucky that this didn’t happen. Our unit has been deemed an ‘essential’ specialised service and remained open, but the changes have happened thick and fast – first we started discharging patients so we could do social distancing, and because some patients were judged at more risk of contracting Covid on the ward than they were from their eating disorders. We were left with the patients who were the most unwell or complex – and also trying to cope with having some staff off work self-isolating (pregnancy or vulnerable groups) as well as trying to put in place all the required measures such as PPE, distancing etc – so there was a huge impact on the care/treatment we usually provide. Therapeutic groups stopped for a while, and patients were spending a lot of time in their individual bedrooms alone. We then moved to a larger ward, which means I now have to either use public transport to travel to work or walk for about an hour, or occasionally get a lift or a taxi. We had to take several new admissions within 2 weeks, to get back up to our usual capacity – which has been stressful and tiring, as has the travel. However there have also been some positives: we’ve got some great staff working with us from services that have been temporarily closed or scaled back, and some of the new band 4 student nurses on extended placements. They have all brought a lot of enthusiasm with them, which is an amazing attitude to have (and makes me feel ashamed for having felt so frightened about the idea of being redeployed myself) – and we now have more staff on most shifts than usual. The ward is much bigger so that we can run more of a therapeutic programme again, splitting groups into smaller sub-groups in different rooms or at different times – and using 3 different dining rooms at mealtimes to enable more space between staff and patients. Logistically this is extremely challenging and has been very stressful to implement – but now that we have more staff, who are getting used to working in eating disorders (not an area most of them knew anything about!) it has been getting a bit easier. We have also had a lot of changes in PPE guidance and clothing: again, it all makes work more time-consuming and stressful, but now we have scrubs which mean we don’t have to wear the plastic aprons (hot and flimsy!) except if doing close physical obs – likewise gloves. We do have to wear surgical masks on the ward, which we all hate – but if we’re more than 2 meters away from other people in a large enough room then we can take them off There has been a lot of new information and online training relating to Covid that I’ve had to try andtake inandprocess:I’m a staffnurse (sometimesthe only qualified nurse onshift) soit has felt anxiety-provoking trying to engage with that – imagining what if you have a cardiac arrest and are trying to frantically don apron/gloves/eye protection etc when usually you would be jumping straight in and doing CPR (which would be nerve-wracking enough – but at least without all that added fear and complication!) M-O Number: H6109 Female, 42, single, Bristol Mental health nurse We have had 1 suspected case on our ward but the swab came back negative and the patient remained quite ‘well’ – just a raised temperature. We had to isolate her and barrier nurse her for a couple of days while waiting for the results. Now we are in the new ward (which has en-suite bathrooms, whereas the old unit didn’t) we are isolating all new admissions in their rooms until tested. We are doing a lot of work to try and minimise risks, but still it’s easy to imagine that if one person (staff or patient) did contract it, it could still spread... All in all, it has been a very tough period, and the changes look set to continue – but I continue to be happy at work: I work in an area that I am passionate about, and have wonderful colleagues – we have supported each other through it all, remaining cheerful and keeping the sense of humour that MH workers seem to share and need. I don’t know how I’d have coped if I’d had to isolate at home alone with the fears in the news and the worry about paying rent/bills etc if my job was not secure. That said, work has been even more stressful and exhausting than usual – and Ido feel I need a break. I’ve lost weight, and am finding it difficult to eat more (not a good situation given that I need to look healthy to be a positive role model for our eating-disordered patients! – and I do have a past history of anorexia myself and know I need to be careful to avoid relapse in times of stress). But I’ve got access to some confidential support and clinical supervision at work, so am trying to use that as well as prioritise my own wellbeing a bit more. I tend to skip my breaks, but am trying to break that habit. Overall, I am worried about maintaining the changes at work once the redeployed staff return to their regular services again, and we have to do the same with fewer staff. I’m also worried about how much less support there is for people with MH needs generally, especially in the community: it’s a dire situation at the moment. But I am trying to take it one day, one week at a time and not look too far ahead... Personally I have a lot to be grateful for in my work situation, and am very mindful of that. Home: I live alone but the situation has prevented me from seeing my parents/sister as planned since my parents began self-isolating a week or so before the official lockdown started, and my sister has been living with them. Even now I don’t know when we’ll next be able to meet, as I’d have to use public transport to get to them (train journey is about 40 mins) and this doesn’t feel safe enough – for me or even more so in case I were to pick something up and infect them. M-O Number: H6109 Female, 42, single, Bristol Mental health nurse Technology I’ve been very glad of things like email, texting and Facetime –I use these about the same amount as usual. – I also speak to my mum on the phone at least once a week, again about the same as before, but all of these are more valuable to me as I’m not seeing anyone socially. Have recently been using Houseparty a bit too, to do quizzes with my parents, sister and her partner – it’s a bit glitchy but we also enjoy and value keeping these routines going. It’s nice to see them all pop up too, rather than just texting or talking. I’ve been using Instagram about the same amount, but Twitter less: Instagram I focus on photography and foodie accounts, which have been influenced by current events but in a positive way. Twitter feels a bit overwhelming as I follow mainly nursing/mental health/NHS accounts. I miss hugs. Shopping and food I only buy food in stores rather than online – I don’t spend enough to warrant online deliveries and usuallyprefertogointostoresinperson,andIdon’tlikehavingtoarrangetobe in to receive online orders. However since Covid I have often wished I was an existing online customer! – but I guess I feel it’s more important that vulnerable people are prioritised for delivery slots. I have been anxious about shopping, and have changed the stores I go into, and I go less often. I used to pop into Waitrose a couple of times a week for a free coffee and a couple of bits of grocery, sometimes maximising the newspaper offer on days I usually buy it – therefore saving quite a lot. But the last time I went there was a horrible experience: just before lockdown when people were panic-buying but before the social distancing measures were implemented. The shop was crowded and stressful, and I didn’t get everything I needed due to empty shelves. I’ve been past there a couple oftimes but the queue outside didn’t look as well-spaced as Tesco, and I felt too anxious to go in. I have also not been into the little Polish shop near me, where I used to go for milk/essentials – again it has made me feel too anxious because it is very small and I worry about feeling trapped inside. Instead I’ve been going to the big Tesco roughly once a fortnight, as early as possible, as it feels ‘safer’. I tried going there once during the special ‘NHS hour’ but there was a huge queue of NHS workers so I gave up and went away – but that was during the worse week of panic-buying. I’ve also been going to the smaller supermarket branches nearby a couple of times a week, for my newspaper at weekends plus fresh and frozen veg/milk/toilet roll etc: eg Co-op, Sainsburys Local, Tesco Express – even though I didn’t usually use them as the prices are higher. In the last week, I have also been to Lidl a couple of times: I walk past there on my way to work now, and took advantage of there being no queue outside to stock up on a few things (coffee, cereal etc – things that are cheaper there). Generally speaking availability has drastically improved: 2 weeks ago the shelves were almost empty but now it’s just a few things which tend to be low in stock. This all does cause me quite a bit of anxiety as I have ahistory of eating disorders, and find it difficult to spend more on food (in the past I used to walk miles to get things at the cheapest possible prices) – and I still feel more anxious about eating if I think I’m running out of key items like fresh veg, milk etc. But I am coping. M-O Number: H6109 Female, 42, single, Bristol Mental health nurse My eating/cooking habits have stayed roughly the same, although there are a couple of things that I am no longer buying (a supermarket own-brand of Ryvita-style crackers, and eggs) mainly because they were often out of stock in supermarkets and I began to panic about not knowing if I’d be able to get more. So I just stopped buying/eating them. I continue to cook and eat the same kind of things otherwise. Entertainment and Leisure I did increase my exercise (running) around the time Covid became more of a concern... to the extent that I hurt my knee and had to stop for about 3 weeks! I’m doing it again but it’s become more stressful with so many more people out jogging/running, and a lot of people not being very considerate/mindful of the 2 meter rule. Now that lockdown is easing there is more traffic again, so it’s becoming harder to avoid pedestrians/cyclists/traffic.... I will have to try going even earlier in the morning. I’m doing a lot more walking – sometimes as an alternative to running, and sometimes to get to/from work (my workplace is now an hour’s walk away not 15 mins). Otherwise I haven’t changed or taken up new hobbies: I’m still working full-time. I do miss planning/going to the theatre and to see art/dance etc. Watching TVis one ofthethingsthathashelpedme mosttodistract/relax/forgetaboutCovid:I’ve been watching a wide variety of things – the latest seasons of Better Call Saul, Homeland, and catching up on some things I didn’t watch at the time (Billions, the old UK version of House of Cards), as well as some documentaries about music/arts/social history on iPlayer, and current series like Masterchef, First Dates, Have I Got News For You etc. I have also been rewatching old episodes of Allo Allo and The Americans (comfort viewing and something to discuss with my mum and dad who are also watching them). Personal hygiene No changes in personal hygiene, though I could do with a haircut! Sleep My sleep hasn’t changed much ( I take medication for anxiety which helps with sleep – predating Covid) but I am dreaming more intensely and memorably: a lot about work, shopping for food, and slightly stressful/anxious situations."

In March at the beginning of lockdown, people announced various time fillers into their day and what they would do to keep boredom at bay.  For me, I found I had less time for me personally and even less time to contemplate how I could use it more effectively. With my boys being homeschooled, my husband and myself working at home and with building work starting on our new home, it was a time pressure monster, well that is how it felt.  I started to feel burdened trying to manage any kind of normal routine for the boys, work and then time to walk the dog, do the housework and cook supper. I experienced anxiety mostly I think because I felt like a failure.  I was failing to be a mother as I saw it, I was failing to keep my head above water with work hours, I was failing to project manage effectively our house refurbishment and I was failing to devote time to my animals.  I also felt like I was ill equipped to deal with how I felt about the situation and how I could support my children through it too. Rhythm, Routine and Homelife Consequently, something had to give.  Luckily I have a superb boss and he is very pro work life balance, so really the only pressure on me was from myself.  However, I sought help and telephoned my doctor for antidepressants.   The whole lockdown for me was like standing still in a melay of turmoil around me.  I felt like I was having an experience which I could neither control nor stop.  I spent the time listening to audiobooks and tuning out of life mostly.  Skulking away as much as I could from everything.  As the antidepressants took charge, my weight lifted and I felt much more able to cope with the whole situation. I stepped back from the build, and let my very capable builder get on with it, only asking me or my husband questions when he needed to.  I encouraged my husband to help with supper and household chores.  I made sure I put time aside for walking the dog, which had a two fold benefit.  Firstly, she was much happier, and secondly it gave me time in nature, our woodland, alone and out of the house, away from the computer and boys demands, letting their father take the lead. Now, months on, I am trying very hard to keep the balance.  I have taken a week away from work to coincide with half term and have spent a lot of time sleeping, walking and alone.  I know that I must not work over the hours I am paid for but it is hard because it helps me feel connected to those I used to see everyday at work.  Screen time meetings wear me out, but I am conscious of this and will be making sure my routine is adhered to as much as I can for my own mind. So instead of walking around in a daze not knowing what to do with myself I am now up early, out with the dog, back to shower change then breakfast and work.  After work I have an hour to myself doing whatever I want, of course sometimes this is supporting the boys or doing house things but I  P6588 try to limit that to only 1 or 2 afternoons a week.  I plan to meditate more, get back to my yoga, even if it is online and not feel guilty for any of it.  Evening times once my husband has finished work, we both cook supper and after supper have time with the boys before the youngest goes to bed and the older one disappears for gaming time.  It is a new routine for us, and for now we are all coping better.  I guess, as circumstances change we will adapt too.   Sleeping has always been an issue for me, years of working shifts does not help, but now I hope I am conquering this too!  A routine bedtime and wake time really helps me personally."

However we finally settled in Northumberland in 1992 and have lived here ever since.  We downsized three years ago, leaving a very rural environment to live on a small housing estate.  I miss my old house but understand that as we get older we maybe need to be closer to services.  I'd love to be able to go back to that sort of situation though but i don't think that my husband would agree.",Married,Married for 46 years,Associate professional occupations,Police service staff (Legal Dept mgr),Employee,Police service staff (Legal Dept mgr),Bank Regional Director,,"COVID-19 pandemic (2020-);COVID-19--restrictions--lockdown;News and current affairs;Emotional states;COVID-19--public information;Family members;Life events;Employment and occupations;COVID-19--government and policy (international);Teaching and education;Family life;Communication;Leisure time and social activities;Shopping and retail;Partners (personal);Food;Lifestyle, health and well-being;Society and social behaviour;Personal hygiene;Housing, homes and gardens;Sleep;",Digital;Word Processed;,,6,eng,07/05/2020,"Response to the Mass-Observation Project Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)'.

It’s as if we’ve never had challenges in our lives before. To me, there’s lots of things in life that provide challenge and that’s the way it’s always been to my mind. This is different because of the fact that we are all facing the same problems at the same time. It’s getting lousy now. At first I was ok with the situation. I think that I’m very lucky compared to many. I’ve got a nice house on a small estate in a pleasant part of the world. I can get into the countryside to have a walk in around five minutes from my house (no driving of course). I can’t imagine how somebody living in a high-rise block as a single parent with three kids can manage though. I’m trying to keep my pecker up but it’s becoming more difficult. I’ve sort of given up with the news. So many reports saying so many different things that you don’t know what to believe. It’s not news really, its mere speculation and that’s not helping anybody. I’ve been getting really angry with some news reports which seem to be more intent on sensationalising the situation. As if it wasn’t sensational enough! The BBC on Sunday excelled itself. “The Government has admitted today that people are finding the lockdown difficult.” No shit Sherlock. I seem to remember that the Government says every day that they appreciate that times are difficult for people so how is that news? There’s far too much of that so I’ve given up. I follow the daily briefings and listen to the relevant minister and the science and medical reps and then I look at the statistics. After that I generally get up to prepare the evening meal. The media ask the same questions day after day. I’m not convinced that they listen to the answers. They just have to say something because they’re on the tele. Of course there should be BSL interpreters available and it’s rather shocking that nobody has realised that the failure to provide that interpretation is a serious omission. If we’re all in this together surely that includes those who are hard of hearing as well? Or do they have some sort of immunity? I don’t entirely trust statistics. “More or Less” on Radio 4 perfectly illustrates the manner by which statistics can be manipulated to present a particular point of view. It should be compulsory listening for the nation. I look at Twitter from time to time, but I don’t like the nasty comments that some anonymous cowards appear to indulge in. That’s the unpleasant side of social media. However the memes and comments which appeared when Trump speculated about disinfectant and bleach properties were brilliant and really cheered me up. So I’m finding lockdown more difficult than I did, that’s for sure. I wake up every morning with a kind of knotted feeling in my stomach and then have a little debate with myself as to whether to get up or not, Of course, I always do in the end. My husband would only start a lecture if I didn’t so I try to avoid that if I can. I was feeling a little optimistic that maybe we could start to see a little easing of things by June, but I don’t think that is possible now. There are particular difficulties for me. My eldest daughter was due to have her second baby at the end of March and I was scheduled for go down to Essex to help out. I was going to fly from Carlisle to Southend. I was really looking forward to it. But, of course, that all went by the wayside when the restrictions came in. I did get my money back though. But I was very sad to miss it. C was born safely and is well, but I haven’t been able to visit or hold her. She is nearly six weeks old now. I said to my husband that she’ll be in school uniform before I can get to cuddle her. Then my youngest daughter CK was due to be married in April to R, who is a Romanian guy. They had people coming from all over the world for the wedding in Manchester – Australia, Canada, Italy, and Romania of course. Everything was arranged and paid for and we were all looking forward to meeting up again. My son, DK, lives in Australia with his wife and two children and we don’t get to see them very often. It was going to be a grand reunion. That all got postponed and has been re­arranged for October, but I am becoming more dubious as to that going ahead as well. Lots of talk about “long-term” situations are not very encouraging. Those two situations continue to cause me anxiety. CK is also worried about her job. She works in marketing and was going to start a new job with a big company right as the lockdown commenced. She had already left her previous employer but they took her back on during the furlough period and so she has a reduced income but no guarantee that her new job will happen. She’s signed a contract but that apparently has no significance if they withdraw the job offer. So by June she could be unemployed. I’m very worried about that. In Australia, my son is working from home and his wife, who is a graphic designer with Quantas, has been laid off until June. She may know after that as to whether she will be made redundant or not. Her Mum has already been made redundant from her work as an accountant with a leisurewear supplier. Things in Australia appear to be a little easier, as the kids are still able to go to school and nursery. No pubs or restaurants but some of the shops are open. News reports yesterday stated that Australia and New Zealand may try to form a “bubble” to allow travel between those two countries but nowhere else. DK would not therefore be able to come to the wedding, even if it were to go ahead. Travel generally is likely to be disrupted for a considerable period of time I suppose. That’s another problem for the wedding. R will obviously want his family to be there and his Dad lives in Canada. I can’t see it happening if travel means that they can’t fly to the UK. My second eldest daughter, LC, is a lawyer specialising in insolvency and bankruptcy. The fact that she is so busy tells you all! She is stowed under with cases and attended a hearing from her bedroom via video link last week. It was bizarre. She had to show the judge that she was alone in the room and that there were no funny devices around. She had to spend the weekend tidying up her bedroom so that the judge wouldn’t think that she was an untidy skunk, even though she is. Her husband, DC, is self employed but hasn’t been working, even though he probably could as he works as a plumber and maintenance agent. He generally has work from another bloke who has many properties in the region, but I don’t know what is happening with that. He couldn’t qualify for any help as he has only been set up from the beginning of the year, so he didn’t have any tax records on which to base his claim. Needless to say he is not impressed with the government. My husband, SK, isn’t overly impressed with him though. SK says that as he works outdoors most of the time he could get out and work. He seems to spend all of his time gaming and SK is extremely critical of him and his moaning. They have a son, NC, who is five and had just started school. DC doesn’t want him to return to school until he is happy that it will be safe for him to do so. I’m concerned that NC is missing out on things though. DC is supposed to be doing the home-schooling bit and I’m not convinced that he is putting much effort into it. They don’t seem to get dressed either and spend most of their time in their pyjamas. These little routines, getting showered, getting dressed do make a difference I think. I just hope that NC doesn’t fall too far behind. I did buy him a set of books from his reading scheme and L says that he has been reading but I’m not sure of the level of effort going into it. His Dad wasn’t very academic, even though I think that he is a highly intelligent guy, so I’m not sure what level of encouragement he’s getting from that area. Time will tell I suppose. My eldest daughter, VG and her husband, DG, appear to be doing well with their eldest , HG and the new baby, CG. DG is a teacher at a secondary school in Essex, very committed to the kids who he teaches. He’s been delivering lessons on Zoom and also goes into school on a rota basis to assist with the kids whose parents are working. He says that there are not many at the school. Only about five or six. He feels that some kids, where the parents maybe don’t bother, will fall way behind with their education. The school has its share of problem children (ages 11-16) but DG is so committed that he wants to try to find ways of helping them. He gets a little despondent as he realises that there is not much more that he can do. If only we were all given the benefit of prophecy that would allow us to know what would happen in the next twelve months. We have clearly not got everything right. Statistics are telling us that we have the worst level of deaths in Europe. How has this happened? I have my doubts when it comes to comparisons with other countries. There are all kinds of other factors which can influence the outcomes after all. I was thinking the other day that whilst we still say that the number of deaths is still low percentage wise, how would we react if over 700 people were killed in a single day in an event such as a fire, a bombing, or an air crash? It would be shocking wouldn’t it? Now we see 200 deaths as being an encouraging sign of improvement. It all seems to be rather bizarre. I speak with the family every Saturday using Zoom and we take it in turns to organise our weekly quiz on Kahoot. It’s R’s turn this week. We meet at 11 am so that DK and his family can join in too. Some of the questions can be really funny and a bit off the wall. I’ve learnt a little more about technology since this business started. I’m a member of a local creative writing group and we organised a meeting on Zoom. I offered to start it as host. None of us are particularly tech-savvy so it took half an hour to get everybody on. That took up half of the meeting time, but it was nice to see everybody, and they were all well and glad to be able to join in. I spoke with two of my siblings on Sunday as well and that’s the first time we’ve managed to do that. I don’t know why we haven’t done it before, even prior to Covid because we all live in different parts of the country. CK’s wedding was going to be the first time that we’ve all met up in quite a while and, of course, that didn’t go ahead. We’ve agreed to meet up again in a couple of weeks and to stay in touch so that’s something positive that’s come out of this business. I’ve been looking at YouTube a lot, remembering different events. I love sport so I play some of the old triumphs but as I support Fulham there’s not so many of them! I follow rugby and cricket as well and I really miss not being able to go and see the games. It seems to me that this is something that is going to be difficult to deal with. I’m not so bothered about Premier League as I think they’ve been greedy for quite a while and it serves them right. But I feel for the smaller teams and whichever way they’re going to sort out promotion and relegation to the various leagues there is bound to be a degree of unfairness attached to the process. I just hope that they can keep going. After the initial panic buying which we all got caught up in things seem to have settled down and whilst we may have to queue there is nothing like the fuss that there was at the beginning. I can get almost everything I need with the exception of flour, which doesn’t seem to be available at all. We went out yesterday to do our weekly shop and SK was told that we couldn’t go in together – only one person per trolley. They’ve just brought that in this week. SK was not happy and stomped off back to the car in high dudgeon. I just got on with the shopping. He has had moments in the past few weeks where he just seems to lose his temper over nothing. I guess that it’s all to do with the tension and worry over this wretched business. I cook every day and as we are both following a certain type of diet (low carb, low sugar), I plan the meals out for the whole week and then shop accordingly. As we’ve made so much progress we have the occasional chocolate treat, but you’ve got to keep that sort of thing under control or you’ll be undoing all of the good work done to date. We’re both Type 2 but we’ve done so well that I think that we’re now classed as pre-diabetic. Still plenty to do though. Some people on the estate have organised things like vegetable deliveries, egg delivery and beauty products. One person has arranged for a takeaway van to visit in a couple of weeks, so we have to put our orders in and collect in an allocated time slot. It’s something to look forward to. One of the guys has just started an exercise group which runs on a Saturday morning, which is just as well if we are starting to eat takeaways. The other Saturday one of the little girls who lives down the road had her seventh birthday and her Mum put something on our resident Facebook page to say that she (her daughter) was feeling a little low because she couldn’t have a party or anything. So she asked us whether we would go along and sing “Happy Birthday” to her. So we all trotted down and at the appointed time her front door opened and out came E to a chorus of “Happy Birthday”. She was really surprised, and I thought that her Mum was going to cry. Then we all clapped and gave her a little present and card. It wasn’t quite a party, but it was the best that we could do, and I think that we were all glad to join in. We do our NHS clap on a Thursday and there are plans for a big party once the lockdown is lifted but it might be that that is quite a while away yet! The other week we, (SK and I), had a blazing row in the car park. He said all sorts of nasty things to me and I haven’t forgotten them. I took off my wedding ring and I haven’t put it back on yet. I may do at some point, but I was deeply hurt at his remarks and it isn’t something that I can just get over. It was nasty . A couple of days later I asked him whether he meant what he said, and he replied that he hadn’t, that he was sorry and that he was ashamed. We’ve been married for nearly 45 years and it would appear from those remarks that he had never been happy. He said that it wasn’t the case and he didn’t know why he had said what he said. Can you simply forget about that sort of thing? Should I? I was so upset about the whole business that I’m still trying to decide what to do. The trouble with SK is that he always has opinions that he thinks others need to hear. I’ve sort of learnt to switch off, but I can make a little remark and then have to endure a twenty-minute lecture. He may be right about some things, but he isn’t always right, (who is?). It reminds me of a Pam Ayres poem called “They Should Have Asked My Husband”. It describes him perfectly I think. I can be speaking with somebody and he will just come in and take over. I hate that. I’m not saying that he shouldn’t speak but he tends to start promulgating and I can’t get a word in edgewise. And he shouts because I think that he may be a little hard of hearing. Of course, he denies all of this. Perhaps being thrown together for long periods of time, being unable to go out and do our different things is making life a little more difficult. Things that previously may have been of no importance now seem to be more irritating. Don’t think that I’m not able to stand up for myself though. I’m quite capable of standing my ground when I need to. It’s just that sometimes I can’t be bothered, so I switch off. I’ve been doing a lot of reading. I love to read, all sorts of things. I’m currently wading through Antonia Fraser’s book on Mary Queen of Scots. Actually, I’m re-reading it as the last time I read it was when I was about 16, so I’ve forgotten most of it. I read Hilary Mantel’s latest and I’ve also read in the past couple of weeks “On Chapel Sands” by Laura Cumming, “Things in Jars” by Jess Kidd, “The Mesmerist” by Wendy Moore and “The Five” by Hallie Rubenhold. I’ve read “Bookworm” by Lucy Mangan and “The Churchill Factor” by BJ on Kindle. I prefer holding a proper book if I’m honest and I do find some of the choice on Kindle quite limiting. It’s good for when I’m on holiday (wonder when that will happen again). I’ve ordered Jon Sopel’s book on the White House and Trump and that’s being delivered today. I’m looking forward to that. Trump fascinates and repels me in equal measure. I still can’t understand how he got to be President. I write a lot, partly for the group but also because I’m trying to finish my second novel. I am still trying to get an agent interested in the first one but no luck so far. I always get the same general response, which is to encourage but “it doesn’t fit our brief at the moment”. I enter some writing competitions, (there are loads of different websites), but I’ve only been long-listed once. I won’t stop trying though. At least this lockdown gives me more time to concentrate on that part of my life, which I really enjoy. I can’t go to the gym now and I can’t meet up for coffee with anybody so there’s just me, the old man and my books and writing. I miss meeting up with LC and NC a great deal but hopefully that won’t be for much longer. We walk nearly every day and ensure a minimum of 10,000 steps. I’ve got my Fitbit to keep me right on that. The only thing which gives me a problem are the cyclists, usually clad in lycra, who insist on whizzing about with little care for walkers who may be in front of them. Some of them are downright dangerous and act as if they’re in the lead of the Tour de France. At least the considerate ones and the people we pass who are also walking say good morning and are friendly enough. We keep to the social distancing advice rigorously and are often diving into hedges and so on to make sure that we maintain the two-metre space. I’ve noticed in the past couple of weeks that there seems to be less adherence to this amongst some and there definitely appears to be a little more traffic on the road, although it is still nowhere near the levels that we are used to. I’m very keen to have a haircut as soon as possible. SK has ordered a pair of clippers which is fine for him as he generally shaves his head anyway. I’m tempted to ask him to do mine in the same way. I did have my hair shaved once when I had cancer seven years ago and it didn’t worry me at all, but SK appears to be reluctant to do it. Anyway, they aren’t going to be delivered until June, (a very popular item on Amazon), so I’ve got time to think about it. SK is spending a lot of time in the garden now that the weather has improved. He’s got various projects on the go and he really gets stuck in with gusto. Wood has been delivered and he is planning some new features as a result. It’s not that we have a massive garden, but he has designed it from scratch and it’s beginning to look really nice. I do wonder how much has been spent on it but that’s his hobby and it’s fair enough. Just before the lockdown I’d got membership of English Heritage. We were going to spend the summer in visiting all sorts of places. We’ve already got National Trust membership so I thought that English Heritage would give us full access to everything. Obviously, we haven’t been able to go anywhere so it will be interesting to see how they deal with the membership situation. We’ve spent quite a lot of money on Friends of Alnwick Gardens, Railcard, National Trust and English Heritage and we haven’t had any chance to use them. We are still sticking to our routines of washing, both ourselves and our clothes. That’s very important I think. There’s no need to let yourself go. My dental appointments were all cancelled, and we pay into a monthly dental plan with BUPA. We haven’t heard a thing from them and there’s nothing on their website. Basically we are paying for a service which we can’t access. I know that it’s very difficult for dental services in the current climate but maybe we should get some of our money back? It will be interesting to see what happens later in the year. We mainly watch tv in the evenings. We subscribe to Sky, although I don’t know why, as most of the programmes are not very entertaining for me. I like history and some films, but not Marvel stuff. We both enjoy “Killing Eve” but I tend to prefer documentaries but definitely NOT reality tv, which I can’t abide. I’ve never watched things like “Love Island” or “TOWIE”, for example. The people are so shallow and vacuous and especially in times like this they are more irrelevant than ever. I like to be cheered up and I enjoyed “Have I got News for You” even though there is no audience. It still works. Other programmes don’t work so well. “Question Time” is definitely much better without the baying masses but Graham Norton’s show seems quite flat. Soaps were full of miserable people living miserable lives, so I haven’t watched them for years anyway. Corrie has never been the same since the departure of Hilda Ogden, in my opinion! I appreciate that all media is trying to help people to cope with the situation, (leaving aside my remarks about journalists though) and that they understand that they have an important role to play in this. So good for them that they have stepped up to the plate and are trying to do their best. The stuff produced for children’s education, for example, is varied and entertaining at the same time. I’m learning a lot! I also love to see the daft videos that people are producing showing their various endeavours. They cheer me up a lot as well. I have found sleeping to be more difficult over the past few weeks. I am trying to work out why. I don’t sleep during the day and I don’t use social media before I got to bed. I usually read a book before I turn out the light but then I find that I wake up around two or three in the morning and I can’t get back to sleep. I suspect that my anxiety levels are the cause of the problem. I did have a dream the other evening when I was in a claustrophobic situation, hemmed in by boxes and I couldn’t get out. I felt panicky and distressed and it woke me up. I took quite a while to get back to sleep after that. It’s the only experience that I’ve had though. Well, that’s me for now. I’ll read this in a few years’ time and wonder what all the fuss was about!"

I didn’t begin writing this part until 6 July so now I have some perspective on the last few months. have been keeping a journal since March and I can see how my experiences and feelings have changed during lockdown. I am not a risk taker and happy to follow any instructions, so despite not being in the vulnerable category, I was taking precautions and preparing for the worst before the official lockdown. I felt most worried in March to May but can see things are now improving and have relaxed a little in the last month. I am not as obsessive as I was, but am still taking precautions e.g. sanitising post and shopping and not using supermarkets. When I first saw the initial reports coming from China at the beginning of the year it worried me a great deal to hear about people of cruise ships, flying back from skiing holidays etc. Although I could understand why people would be reluctant to lose money or miss out on their holiday, I couldn’t for the life of me see why people would risk their health for that, and were continuing to travel abroad with that looming on the horizon. However I assumed that the UK would be well­organised, we were an island and could isolate easily, that people would be quarantined coming into the country. As an adult I have rarely travelled outside the UK and am always surprised at the huge numbers of people that are always moving around the world and I was dismayed in the early days of the pandemic to see the lack of restrictions introduced to incoming visitors or residents. There was understandably a lack of information about the virus, but the Government simply did not seem to be taking what was happening in the Far East seriously, and it seemed that the overlying assumption was that the UK population would simply not co-operate in the same way as people as China or Korea. I remember one commentator saying ‘we may not ever know if we did too much at the beginning of the outbreak in the UK, but we will certainly know if we did too little’. That has turned out to be somewhat prophetic. At the beginning of the year I had seen a repeat of a BBC documentary first screened in March 2018 about the potential for viruses to spread. This was made in conjunction with Cambridge University, using an app downloaded by volunteers and focussing on Haslemere. It was fascinating to see how a ‘super-spreader’ (who worked in a hardware shop) had ‘infected’ so many other people. And to see it spread throughout the country within weeks, was extraordinary. The threat of a pandemic similar to SARS or Ebola was well known and many scientists and others have been warning us for many years, but we were still not prepared. The hope that something happening in China wouldn’t impact us too much, was quite wrong of course. I am retired but do voluntary work for various organisations including the National Trust. In February I started working at an additional location. The first day a friend and I met the ranger, together with another new volunteer and we shook hands all round and sat at a picnic bench to discuss the work. After a while it transpired that the other volunteer was an English teacher from China, where his Chinese wife and his two children, were in lockdown in the in-laws’ flat. He said ‘don’t worry, I don’t have the virus’ and we laughed, and I said ‘I’m glad I’m sitting upwind of you’. He had returned to Britain before the Chinese New Year, to visit his UK family. Because he could no longer return to China as planned he was looking for something to do. This incident brought home to me just how inter-connected our world has become, and although this was early in the pandemic, and we had no idea quite how it would impact on the UK, it did ring alarm bells. I was already worried about the reports from China. My friend and I were concerned, and I was trying to work out in my head; how far away is Wuhan from the district that teacher had been working? When is the Chinese New Year? End of January. How recently had he flown back to the UK? Before February. How long before our meeting, was his trip? We had met on 21st February, so this seemed to be beyond the two-week suggested incubation period. Phew. My friend and I met a few times after that, to do litter picking on a stretch of the South West Coastal Path and on beaches well-frequented by visitors and with several latched gates on the path. The other volunteer was working elsewhere. The news about the pandemic grew, and though we thought outside activities wouldn’t be so affected, we personally did take precautions by using gloves and a plastic bag to avoid touching gates with bare hands. On 10 March, I attended a funeral of a friend’s husband in Torbay. Shortly before, the first Covid 19 infection in Devon was diagnosed in that area (school students who had been on a holiday in Italy). I did think twice but decided to go to support her. I took precautions like using sanitiser and offering it to people I was giving lifts to, who were all grateful, and although I thought I probably shouldn’t, I did hug my friend once. At the wake at her house later, she directed people to wash their hands, and though I tried to be careful and keep apart from others, I was quite surprised that other people didn’t seem to be worried and were still shaking hands a lot. I felt a bit uneasy, especially handling her crockery, but reluctant to show too much anxiety in such a social situation. Typically British I suppose, not wanting to cause a scene. People talked a little about the virus, but it wasn’t the main topic, and most seemed quite laid back about it, laughing about not being ‘infectious’. I was glad to leave and get home. The last litter picking session was 21 March and my friend and I were travelling there separately, and practising social distancing with each other and other users of the paths, but were concerned to see lots of groups of people not changing their behaviour at all. Worryingly for me, this included a large party walking with my next-door neighbours who wanted to stop for a chat. I did my best to step up a bank to avoid them. The week before lockdown was a weird time; I had a real feeling of being on the brink of something awful. I have a history of mild anxiety and although consider myself resourceful, knew that living on my own would bring additional worries especially if I was to become unwell. That week I had to attend a health clinic on two consecutive days and although advised it would be better not to drive, I didn’t want my sister to take me (she was self-isolating early) and I didn’t want to take a taxi either. The clinic was well-organised and quiet so I felt OK there. Seeing the panic buying in supermarkets on TV was truly appalling. I shopped on the way home from the clinic, including for my sister who hadn’t been able to get certain items on her online shop. I had to go to three supermarkets in total and it was hard not to over-react when seeing those empty shelves. I have a good store cupboard and stocked freezer at the best of times however so wasn’t overly worried. Nevertheless I bought a few things that normally I wouldn’t have bought until I had run out of them, such as frozen vegetables and long life milk. I didn’t need loo rolls though; I normally buy recycled or bamboo products online and had a good stock anyway. I had nursed my late husband and still had some supplies of wipes, sanitiser and gloves, so felt lucky I wasn’t having to worry about those. In fact I was able to help a friend who was having problems getting them. At home I decided to turn part of my ornamental bed back into a veg patch and my last shop was not to the supermarket but to the garden centre to get items for salad and veg growing. I felt relieved that I was prepared for what I thought was coming, but what worried me most at that stage, was the potential risk to my sister’s access to food and medication. I was very thankful that her organic veg box delivery would continue, and that she had been able to sign up for supermarket delivery. That last week I also had central heating engineers visit. I had prepared the utility room and cleared the adjacent loo in case they needed to use it, provided sanitiser, soap etc. When they arrived I opened the front door and stepped back, tried to keep apart from them and was surprised that neither of them seemed particularly self-aware. They obviously had not had any instructions or guidance about precautions or distancing. One clearly had a cold; that was enough to really worry me. Thankfully they didn’t have to stay long, but not before I had to sign their handheld recorder. I really did scribble my signature at arm’s length and wouldn’t hold the recorder itself. After they left I disinfected every surface I thought they could possibly have touched. My anxiety in those days was (and continues to be) tinged with real sadness as I tried to prepare for whatever was coming but I had no-one to really share this crisis with. My late husband was enormously practical and would have thrived on tackling problems and finding solutions. However if the pandemic had happened three years earlier, it would have been horrendous dealing with that in his final months when I had nursed him at home. I still receive support from the hospice that cared for him (and would normally be doing voluntary work for them) and it is sobering knowing that patients and clinical staff are still dealing with terminal illness and end of life situations in the midst of all this uncertainty. I know I am fortunate to have a comfortable home with reasonably up to date technology, a good sized garden, access to the woods nearby etc. I watched with worry about stories of other people without those things. I was glad that daily exercise was permitted from the start and I think that was a good decision. It angered me though to see reports of people not distancing, sharing outdoor gym equipment, cycling closely past others without any consideration etc. I go for my daily exercise early in the morning to avoid other people and only once have had a concern when the paperboy passed me quite close from behind. I am still anxious about touching my gate when coming in and out, and leave the gate open so the postal workers don’t need to touch it. They often courteously close it, so especially in the early days I would go out to wipe it down with bleach (I was sanitising my letterbox every day too). These days I just avoid touching the latch or top of the gate. I have a mild heart condition and while not catergorised as vulnerable or on any medication, decided from the outset before any formal lockdown, that I would self-isolate and not go shopping personally. The first weeks were a strange mixture of a heightened feeling of being alive and connected with the rest of the world through TV and radio and internet, and what it was slowly coming to terms with, but I also felt deep anxiety for what was happening and what this pandemic could mean for our species. We were having to change our way of living, day by day. I felt safe staying at home, discussing with friends and family what was happening and how we were dealing with it, taking part in various activities and events and watching and listening to TV and radio. But it was obvious that the NHS’s ability to cope was a huge issue, and many days I woke with a start, feeling anxious and more conscious than usual of my ectopic heartbeat. My GP had given me the option of medication for my condition, should it become too much of a nuisance, although it is not necessary from a clinical point of view. But because of my experiences caring for my husband, I have a heightened worry about falling ill, let alone think about how I would cope having to go into hospital for any reason during the pandemic. I feel I can cope with the condition by continuing to practise mindfulness mediation, using a programme I discovered several years ago. I have upped my practice, using the website’s new online resources designed for the pandemic. Having a routine of doing this twice a day is helpful, as is walking in my nearby woods early in the morning. I also feel better by preparing for the worst. I have packed a bag with essentials should I be taken into hospital for any reason. I have made out a sheet with my personal details, next of kin, health history etc. I make sure that I don’t leave keys in the doors so that my family can get access if necessary. I also have the backup of Benenden membership which is a friendly society offering a GP and mental health helpline, but thankfully I haven’t yet have to seek any medical advice from there or my own GP surgery. I have developed a sensitive tooth and suspect I might have lost part of a filling, and another tooth appears to have a crack, but unless they worsen I shall wait. My spectacle prescription is due for review but I will probably wait until the end of the year before making an appointment. The problem being of course, that I may be less happy to go in the autumn if there is a second spike. My hairdresser has been in touch to say the salon is back in business, but again I am leaving that for another month or two. I’m not overly conscious of my appearance, can manage at the moment with unruly hair. My hygiene and dress habits haven’t really changed, though I have bought some additional joggers as I am spending every day at home. Because my hair takes longer than before t dry, I don’t wash it every day. I am using make up even less frequently than I did before as I am not going out and meeting people much. It took me three weeks initially to get a supermarket click and collect slot. Luckily my nephew was able to drop some fresh food off in the meantime (he was self-isolating too but managed to get a home delivery through his business) which was a great treat. I hope I’ve always appreciated what I have, but being without tomatoes or bananas for example, for several weeks, reminded me how fragile our supply system is, if people aren’t responsible. The situation has made harvesting my own lettuce, spinach and carrots especially rewarding. I enjoy cooking and have continued to batch cook and freeze as usual. I have to be a bit more creative with some of the ingredients, and substitute if I didn’t have the right items, like making flour out of porridge oats to make biscuits for cheese, as I couldn’t get ordinary flour. I had not used online grocery shopping before the pandemic, but have found it relatively easy to use. I have bought from Tesco and Sainsbury, but overall I find the Tesco operation smoother than Sainsbury, both from the items on offer, the substitutions made, and the ease of the website. Collection slots are much more easily available now. I much prefer to shop in person than online for various reasons. Living alone, the size and quantities offered online are not always appropriate. I am an avid label reader and although supermarket websites do list ingredients, it is not always possible to get the full information. Understandably the shops tend to offer most popular items, so some things I specifically look out for, won’t be offered online. For example, there will be dozens of brands of chocolate biscuits available, but few, if any, made with Fairtrade chocolate and without any palm oil. I have had to make some compromises, such as accepting non-organic milk as a substitute. I like buying loose vegetables if they are the right size, as bags sometimes contain too large a quantity. Buying loose online can be difficult though, as when I ordered two sweet potatoes (I was unable to specify the weight, only the number), they were two huge ones, far bigger than I needed and less practical to use. I have plenty of home-made soup in the freezer made from the surplus of various veg. I am only ordering once a fortnight to make up a large enough order to avoid paying extra for the service, so have had to plan meals in a little more detail than usual. But it has made me consult my books and online websites to find new recipes and that has been worthwhile. So overall my buying habits have had to change slightly. Both supermarkets I have been using allow the buyer to specify if substitutions are acceptable, but only Tesco allows a comment to be made. For example, I could specify ‘free range only’ if organic eggs weren’t available. I drew the line at accepting pen-reared pork as a substitute from Sainsbury when they were out of stock of outdoor bred chops, though I would have accepted any other outdoor reared cut. Some of my friends have had to rely on their family to buy shopping as they don’t have the ability to order online but are self-isolating or shielded. One has had great help from their village community. Others have health issues and are over 70 but have still been going to supermarkets from the outset as they are not confident about using technology and unwilling to contact the supermarket to get priority home delivery. So I feel lucky that I have access to online shopping and a car to collect it, as I wouldn’t have qualified for delivery in the early days, though I guess this might have changed (I haven’t bothered to check, as I am happy with collecting). I was very worried when I went to collect my first order as I hadn’t done it before and concerned about being in proximity to the assistants. I had chosen the largest Tesco store locally as although it was not the nearest to me, I knew the car park was big and wouldn’t be difficult to navigate to the collect point. It was well organised though and there was very little interaction with the staff, they were pleasant and efficient. I had put large open bags in my boot into which I could put the carriers with as little handling as possible. I sanitized the groceries at home, either with a bleach solution, wipes or soapy water and those items I didn’t need to refrigerate or use for a while, I left to one side to quarantine. Where possible I took fruit and veg out of their packing and put loose in the fridge. I continue to do the same procedure. Another thing that worried me about going out for the first time to collect, was the fact that my car hadn’t been used for three weeks. I wanted to test it well before my collection day but worried that starting it might drain the battery so I would need to take the car for a drive to make sure it was recharged. That was technically against the regulations at the time. If I left the testing until the morning of collection of my order and it didn’t start, the breakdown service might not sort the problem in time. I read driving organisation’s websites, talked to people and running the engine on the drive wasn’t recommended, so in the end, I started the car early on the day of collection and then risked taking it for a drive for half an hour to ensure a charged battery. It was my first trip anywhere other than a walk to my local woods and I felt quite worried and guilty about just driving around. I then went out to collect my shopping later in the day. It was those sorts of unexpected issues that took up a great deal of my mental energy and caused me anxiety. Since the beginning of lockdown, I have kept lists of DIY and gardening jobs I want to do, and together with my other interests, I have continued to keep my head down and stay at home. When permitted to do so, I met with my ‘support bubble’. We have met several times since, but not every week. By mid-July this included having a birthday meal in my home, which I would have been very reluctant to do in April. Since restrictions were relaxed, I have been meeting a friend regularly outdoors for a walk and a socially distanced coffee (using our own folding chairs and flasks) and we have been fruit picking. As I started to go out, my diary notes the events like ‘first visit to garden centre’ (last thing in the evening, so at a quiet time) ‘first -and to date the only -visit to shop for groceries in person’(not a supermarket but the local farm shop in a big barn, mask on despite not at that time being required by law) and today as I write this, my ‘first visit to council green waste centre’ (nine bags today – about a quarter of what I will probably end up taking). I have done quite a lot of DIY, clearing and sorting of cupboards etc around the house since the lockdown. I am quite practical and have been able to sort a few problems out myself to avoid calling anyone in. I have also been doing a lot of gardening which is a normal activity for me. I am an avid reader and have been getting through quite a few books, some my own, some ordered through the digital library service, and I have bought some online too. Reading new titles and revisiting old ones. Poetry too, which I enjoy. I wrote a poem for an event for a local music charity associated with the hospice, which was published online and won the contest. I have always found it comforting to lose myself in another world in a book and that applies to TV and films too. I have found particular joy in watching videos like Master and Commander and the Harry Potter films again. I only have Freeview, but with BBC I Player, catch-up TV on my laptop, and DVDs, I have plenty of things to view. I have restarted some tapestry I began some years ago, and have also been practising the guitar. Because I have had to stop my volunteering which I did three days a week, I miss the social interaction that gave me, and the sense of being useful. Although one litter picking group has started working again, I have made the decision not to go back for the time being as the woods where I work (not the local ones I walk to) are busier than usual and I would feel too vulnerable trying to physically distance while working. I don’t see a lot of my neighbours although many of us took part in the clap for carers on Thursdays, so I heard them (I have high hedges around the garden). The next door family is approachable and have been thoughtful, bringing around a cream tea for VE celebrations, and offering to cut part of my hedge. So I don’t feel too isolated. My sister and family live in the same city and although I don’t seem them every week, we keep in touch by phone, Zoom, Whats App and Skype. Zoom was new for me, I enjoyed learning to use it and regret that my other friends don’t use it. I felt the Government’s decision to lockdown to protect the NHS was right but it came too late. As said before, I was worried about people travelling back from places with outbreaks such as Italy but no restrictions being placed on them and that was highlighted when the first case in Devon in Torbay was recorded prior to my attending the funeral on 10th March. I can remember saying to my sister in the early days I was very glad to be in the UK, where I felt the National Health Service would mean the response would be well co-ordinated and organised. That we were an island which would help us to isolate. In hindsight that wasn’t the case, partly to do with ignorance about the virus, the reluctance to really look at other countries’ experiences and take the political decision to shut the country down. So much energy was put into getting the NHS ready, which of course was essential, meant that resources were concentrated there without including care homes into the whole system. It is now clear that many opportunities were missed. For example, too much emphasis was put on getting supplies from large companies of PPE rather than sourcing from the very beginning, from a wide range of smaller organisations. I guess there were bureaucratic hurdles like tendering, to overcome, but this meant that supplies were slow in getting where needed. The construction of the Nightingale hospitals has been an extraordinary effort by everyone, and shows what can be done with the right co-operation but where was the same impetus to resource care homes to ensure isolation of people coming out of hospital with the virus? It was left to individual providers, some better than others, to muddle along; all the time the public was being assured by ministers that supplies were getting through, when clearly they weren’t. (NB: since I wrote this early in July, the Panorama programme on care homes has aired and highlighted these issues). I watched every five o’clock briefing for the first few weeks to begin with, then later just waited for the headlines on the news, as the briefings were taking up too much time to watch. They were an important way to get the latest information, however ineffective sometimes the players (interviewers and interviewees) sometimes seemed to be -questions often repeated by different journalists and not answered comprehensively. But overall, I think they were a useful tool in communicating the restriction, showing the number of infections and deaths, especially in the early days and while accepting the shortcomings in some of the statistics, they were a focal point for the country to engage with. I heard one overseas commentator wishing their country’s politicians and health minsters would do a similar briefing – anything but the silence and rumour-mongering they were experiencing. It is easy in retrospect to see the shortcomings of the briefings, but they were the best we had at the time. It would have been good if the TV briefings had included a BSL interpreter. It’s surprising that all news programmes don’t anyway as a matter of course. Other countries seem to be ahead of us there. Considering the briefings were so important, they should have been as inclusive as possible. There are continuing complaints about confusion of instructions, but I think there are bound to be in such a complex, quick-moving situation. And I think a lot of people tend to expect to be fed instructions, rather than being pro-active in checking updates on Gov.uk for example. I have signed up for the daily GOV.uk emails and so now get much of my information about regulations etc from there. I am impressed by the amount of work going on behind the scenes to address so many different aspects of the Covid legislation, arrangements, etc. Despite all their difficulties, it is quite staggering the way that most agencies are working together to deal with the ever-changing situation. But I also worry about the huge amounts of resource being poured into keeping that all going. I sometimes feel helpless in having to be a bystander in what is happening to deal with the pandemic. I see some great initiatives in some cities to track and trace, some wonderful co­operation, especially across local authorities and devolved governments, and some admirable liaison between research organisations, universities and health companies. I can but hope that someone is pulling together all the best initiatives so that we can implement those if we have a second wave. I have downloaded the Zoe health research/Kings College London app, to take part in the Covid Symptom Study. The only way I feel I can contribute to fighting the virus is through helping with research. I get the majority of my news from BBC national and local radio and TV, and online BBC News (including BBC Sounds). I feel on the whole it gives unbiased news and I like their ‘reality check’ news items. I have relatives in British Columbia who are thankful they have a calm Premier and an excellent senior health official handling the pandemic, which is under better control there than the UK. Yet my cousin still watches BBC news as she finds it has integrity. I watch ITV news occasionally as it tends to be lighter in tone, but I avoid watching Piers Morgan as I find him too confrontational and egotistic. It is interesting to see that in countries like New Zealand and BC where the pandemic outcomes are so much better than the UK’s (though geography and demographics have a lot to do with it, obviously) the political parties in power are on the liberal and left. I wonder if the mindset of a Conservative government not to impose on personal freedoms, had too much influence on the willingness to lockdown earlier, and now is also influencing opening up too early. I listen to Radio 4 a lot; it wakes me in the morning and I listen to the World Service at night if I can’t sleep. In the first couple of months of lockdown, I found myself waking with a start, listening to the news and feeling panicky as the death rate kept rising and almost every news items was pandemic-orientated. I then made a conscious effort to switch to Classic FM or Radio 2 for the alarm. Even listening to Radio Devon first thing was worrying me. However I found it very comforting to listen to spoken word channels during the day as it gave so much helpful information and inspirational stories that were very local to me. Over the months my anxiety levels have dropped considerably and I have gone back to Radio 4 to wake up to. I have reduced the number of TV news programmes I watch; and rarely watch more than the headlines on Breakfast and the six or ten o’clock news, then switch over to something else. It took me a while to watch documentaries about the pandemic. I felt I should have more knowledge about for example, China’s slowness in alerting the world to the pandemic, but I just wanted escapism. Being able to watch on demand has been really wonderful, I am able to ration and pace myself with those sorts of programme. I sometimes read the MSN News feed which is on my phone and get irritated by the sensationalist headlines, the insatiable feed of celebrity and all the adverts, but it can be useful for looking at different viewpoints of news items. Online BBC News has good analyses if you take the time to bore down into it. I am fairly sceptical by nature and try to get a balanced view of events. I have engaged with online activities from organisations I am involved with, and national appeals. I enjoy technology and I worry for friends who don’t have access to the internet or who rarely use even a mobile phone. I feel it is important that TV channels continue to provide terrestrial TV and good quality news and information services for everyone in society. I get frustrated for others, when the only way to engage with a TV programme is via social media, or the GOV.uk website and no other source is offered. Local radio is good in that you can usually engage via text or phone as well as social media. I opened Facebook and Twitter accounts a few years ago as I was missing out on information from voluntary groups I belong to and services I use. I am concerned about such power being in the hands of a few large organisations so I use them primarily as an information service and engage as little as possible with them. I have had to use Facebook more often lately, as local businesses tend to update their Covid opening arrangements via social media rather than on their websites. That puts some people who don’t have access to social media, or who aren’t interested in it, at a disadvantage. A friend recently turned up for a late shopping night (which she had done earlier in the lockdown) only to find it closed as they had returned to their original opening hours but hadn’t announced it on their website, only on Facebook. Some friends (in their sixties and seventies) in the same bereavement music group I belong to, have found the technology hard to manage in lockdown, as some live alone and can’t easily get help when problems arise. Trying to keep everyone in the loop has sometimes been difficult. We have been circulating musical parody videos, funny jokes, quizzes etc, but quite a few in the group have missed out on these. Ironically it is the 80+ year-old who is probably best at the techn"

Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. At the beginning of the lockdown period my wife was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, for which she’s been receiving treatment for fourteen years, and I was in generally sound health bar slightly raised blood pressure, for which I take a commonly-prescribed daily medication. Neither condition seems to have been exacerbated by the lockdown or by the wider societal impacts of Covid19. About three weeks ago my wife lost a crown from one of her upper teeth, but its absence isn’t causing any problems and she’s content to wait until the dentist reopens before seeking treatment. Although they don’t live with us, my brother and his wife live very close by, and I’d better mention them now as their situation has had a bearing on ours. They began self-isolating a full fortnight before the lockdown began, because my sister in law’s parents, who live across the road from them, are very elderly and her mother had just begun chemotherapy. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. No, none whatsoever. However, this might be a good point at which to record that I suspect that I’ve either had the coronavirus, or might even be an asymptomatic carrier of the infection. For about six months now I’ve had days on which I’ve woken feeling shivery and slightly ‘flu-ey’, and concluded that I’m going down with a cold or a chill, only to have the symptoms pass over in a day and a half or so; I think I’ve had about a dozen such episodes, most recently in the middle of the last week. Last year I had three bad, lingering colds in quick succession during the spring, which I put down to the unhealthy conditions in the library and constantly having to handle returned books. Since then my immune system’s toughened up, and I think I might have been successfully fighting off something that’s trying to take over my system. I’m no hypochondriac, but I was certainly in an ‘exposed’position in the library, what with doing so many shifts on duty and forever going in and out for meetings and the like. If widespread testing ever becomes available I want to be first in the queue. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I’ve almost made a conscious effort to ignore or set aside emotional responses as overall I feel I have little control over whatever restrictions the government might decide to impose. By way of context: for almost a year and a half I’ve been working as a volunteer at the local community-run library and in November I became Chair of the board of trustees. The workload has been punishing and my immediate reaction, when I finally accepted that the library was going to have to close (which happened only days before the full lockdown began), was one of intense relief. Thank God…a rest! As things have turned out I’ve been kept pretty busy nonetheless, but certainly it’s felt like an opportunity to take stock and consider how I might get my life back under some sort of control in the months to come. Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon Because my wife and I are both retired we haven’t had the stress of being furloughed from work or made redundant, and in fact it occurred to me that had I still been in work I’d have been working from home for some weeks even before the lockdown began. Regarding the inconveniences attendant upon the lockdown -restrictions on free movement, queueing, social distancing and so on -I’ve tried to maintain a benign indifference. I haven’t wasted any time getting annoyed with people behaving foolishly or selfishly, not that I’ve seen many instances of either. I’ve only had one seriously emotional episode, for want of a better word, and that was on the weekend of the VE Day celebrations, or commemorations, whatever they were. There’d been so much pointless and inaccurate comparison between wartime privations and the lockdown that my already twitchy attitude towards the anniversary -can’t we ever stop looking back at our past, and start thinking seriously about how we’re going to get through the century to come? -tipped over into something like depression, which lasted two or three days. I’m sure that ordinarily I wouldn’t have been so powerfully affected. I think my mood was also brought down by an email account from my cousin about the funeral for my aunt, who died at the very end of March: the ceremony had had to be seriously curtailed and the experience had been very upsetting for the whole family. I need to stress that I feel absolutely nothing when it comes to the Covid19 virus itself: I’m not remotely frightened of it, I don’t see it as a portent of climate change or environmental collapse or anything like that. I’m as utterly neutral towards it as it is towards me. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? It’s far too early to give any definitive answer. I’m sure that when things are more or less back to normal -whatever ‘normal’ might mean by this time next year -there’ll have to be the mother of all enquiries into how the pandemic occurred and what should and shouldn’t have been done, but even now I doubt that any severe criticisms would emerge. There really aren’t many options available, in the face of a pandemic: it’s a matter of isolating and treating the sick, then drastically limiting social interaction to reduce the rate at which the infection spreads, then (in modern times) speeding the work of developing a vaccine or cure. The political decisions are to do with the timing of applying the few measures available, and in ensuring that basic necessities of life continue to be available, so that society doesn’t break down completely. I’ve heard people saying already that the lockdown should have been introduced earlier, for example, but ultimately it had to be a matter of judgement and all anyone could say is that if the politicians in question did their best to make sensible judgements, in very difficult circumstances, they’re hardly to be censured. Not just this country but just about everywhere outside the Far East was completely unprepared for a pandemic, and -interestingly -every country tackled it in its own way, with choices determined by the facilities available and their national cultures. Here in the UK the ostentatious deference to ‘the science’ and to the epidemiologists and chief scientific officers has had nothing to do with respect for scientists and experts generally -this is still the Government of Johnson, Cummings and Gove, after all; rather, it’s an acknowledgement that no politician has the first clue about what to do, that they’re practically paralysed by the fear of being held accountable for mass deaths, and that they’ll huddle together whimpering and let someone, anyone else look authoritative and responsible -until things turn out not as badly as they’d feared, at which point they’ll come out swaggering and claiming the credit for strong and decisive leadership. Which I’m afraid is a fair description of our national political culture, at the opening of the third decade of the twenty-first century. Fortunately it contrasts sharply with the national culture of the common people, who by and large have shown great forbearance and patience since the lockdown came into force, and above all with the culture Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon within the National Health Service, whose staff have quite literally been self-sacrificing. Hence the widespread revulsion at the behaviour of Dominic Cummings -or rather, at the attitude displayed by Cummings himself and, more importantly, by Boris Johnson and his circle of sycophantic Ministers, who cynically defended him. If, as is possible, the forthcoming relaxation of lockdown precipitates a second spike in infections, and the lockdown has to be reimposed in whole or in part after another ten or fifteen thousand deaths, the public mood could shift sharply away from ‘the politicians were doing their best’ and towards something far more critical and even vindictive. Johnson appears to have calculated that he can keep Cummings and ride out any short term storm. I believe he’s miscalculated, hugely. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? The public was beginning to chafe against the lockdown even before the Cummings affair but now the restrictions, and the politicians exhorting us to abide by them, are buckling like a line of police holding back rioting football fans. The politicians will make announcements that such and such a restriction is to be eased to this or that extent, but more often than not the public will already have changed its behaviour and the announcement will amount to nothing more than a recognition of what’s happening out there in the real world. I think the government will be relieved, in many ways, if the people insist on getting back to whatever’s left of their old way of living: it’ll kill the need to go on borrowing money on an astronomical scale, and if the public is in effect saying, we’ll take our chances with the virus, the government can’t be blamed for the inevitable casualties. Cynical, certainly, but then again...Johnson, Cummings, Gove. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Every morning, when I get up I step across the landing to the spare room, where my phone charges overnight, and I check the Guardian headlines, just to check whether anything really serious has happened (or if anyone really famous has died of the virus). That’s all, though, just the headlines. When I’m bathed and ready I pop along to the newsagents, where I buy three local papers, the Mail and the Times. While I’m eating breakfast I read the Times, but I’ll tune out and simply skip over any articles about things I already know, and almost all speculative what-might-happen-next pieces. Some mornings I find I don’t want to read any of the Times Covid19 coverage and I begin my serious reading on the ‘other UK news’pages. I’ll read the opinion pages, the letters and the leaders, to see what they have to offer by way of views on the development and overall handling of the pandemic, and I’ll take a look at the business pages too, because the economic consequences of the pandemic are frightening and fascinating all at once. I simply refuse to read the irritating Polly Filla pieces intended to extract humour from having small children interrupting business videoconferences, and so on. I might, during the course of the day, call up various news feeds on the internet, but that depends on what else I’m doing. My primary source of news is BBC Radio 4, specifically the PM programme and the six o’clock evening news. We usually eat dinner at six, so I have the radio on in the kitchen while I’m preparing our meal and I get to hear the daily Ministerial briefing and part of the subsequent Q&A. Then, at six, I get the full news update. And that satisfies me. I feel well enough informed to be able to decide what if anything I’m going to do on the following day, and a day ahead is about as far as I care to plan just now. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I may have caught a few minutes here and there but (see above) I prefer the radio coverage. Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon Overall, I think the daily briefings and Q&A have been worthwhile: they’ve usually managed to be informative and reassuring, possibly because the presence and active participation of scientific advisers lends an air of independent authority and honesty that wouldn’t be there if the politicians were on their own. From time to time I’ve ground my teeth at the seeming inability of a politician to give a straight answer to a question, but at the same time I’ve felt that it’s a combination of lack of scientific understanding and general unpreparedness that’s caused the waffling, rather than a desire to avoid scrutiny. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I haven’t had any problems, but I’ve seen some of Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings and once I got used to the on-screen presence of the interpreter I found I didn’t even notice him or her. I wonder whether we should greatly expand the provision of signing, not just for news bulletins. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Not working in the sense of being employed, but my voluntary work still takes up a lot of my time and I’ve had to adapt to new ways of doing things. See below, under Technology. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My wife and I have coped very well, I think. We’ve changed our routine a little. For example, we used to do the big weekly shop at Sainsbury’s on a Wednesday morning, but since my wife can’t stand in queues for any length of time I now drive over on my own very early on Tuesday morning and get myself in place by 7.30, in the hope of being allowed in before eight. Then, on Wednesday morning, we’llgo asa couple to Marks & Spencer in Sunderland -a ten minute bus journey -to get the things Sainsbury’s doesn’t stock. Most days we’ll each go out for a walk, but at different times. Occasionally we’ve both chafed at not being able to go out for the day in the car; my wife particularly misses trips to the Down To Earth garden centre in Hexham. I miss having friends over for dinner, and going up to Newcastle to visit the shops and the Literary & Philosophical Society. But in general we weren’t great travellers before the lockdown -my wife’s health makes travel very difficult -so we haven’t suffered as badly as many others from the frustration of cancelled holidays or not being able to get away to a second home for the weekend. The lockdown, or rather how strictly one observes it, has led to some tension with my brother and his wife. Very early on they were nagging us -there’s no other word for it -about arranging food deliveries from the local supermarkets. I regarded any such arrangements as quite unnecessary, given that my wife and I weren’t housebound and could be expected to go out to shop, and also likely to be unsatisfactory, as I like to see what I’m buying when it comes to food. I also took the view that very elderly, housebound people should be given priority for what delivery slots were available. I wouldn’t say my brother and I had a row over it but it set the tone for the past couple of months. We’ve had further lectures about using public transport (‘you shouldn’t be doing it’), not wearing masks when we’re out and about, and not joining in the weekly ‘clap the NHS’routine. My brother’s wife has been especially irritating and once or twice I’ve felt a strong urge to give her a clip around the ear. Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon I think the approach my wife and I have taken -not going out unnecessarily, taking reasonable exercise, doing our own shopping while observing social distancing and maintaining good hygiene -has worked well for us, and I suspect most people have been behaving similarly. No one’s under any illusion about Covid19: it’s a nasty disease and you wouldn’t want to get it. But it’s not bubonic plague and if you’re in reasonable general health you shouldn’t live in mortal fear of it. Use common sense. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? It’s not completely new to me, as I’d been using videoconferencing and teleconferencing since the early Nineties, but modern applications such as Zoom and FaceTime are much more versatile than anything I remembered from work days. Since the library closed we’ve held one full trustees meeting on Zoom (and have another scheduled for next Tuesday), and I think I and the other board officers have held around a dozen smaller-scale meetings, using a mixture of Zoom and FaceTime. We’ve also set up a series of WhatsApp groups covering all aspects of library business, so that we can involve individual volunteers without pestering them with stuff they have no need to see and comment on. My brother and I have been using FaceTime, every other day or so. I confess I find videoconferencing wearing outside of ‘work’situations. The novelty quickly wears off, and my brother likes to use his iPad for the calls, balancing it on his lap, which means I have the slightly dizzying feeling that I’m lying on the floor looking up at him. I’ve developed a technique for coping with protracted FaceTime calls: shift the on-screen FaceTime box to the extreme right or left of the screen and keep a document you’re working on or a website page open underneath it, by way of distraction and amusement. To whoever’s on the far end of the call you appear to have your eyes on the screen at all times. I like to think that when the pandemic’s over I won’t feel any need to use FaceTime, Zoom and the like. But I fear too many people will have grown accustomed to them and the technology’s not going to go away. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I hate Facebook and Twitter but have found WhatsApp invaluable as a means of keeping on top of library business. It’s not been entirely business either: for example, one of our volunteers is passing the time in isolation developing his water colour painting skills, and every time he finishes a painting he photographs it and circulates it to the rest of us via WhatsApp. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? The details of my food shopping experiences are set out in the diary I keep for MO, which I’ll be sending in along with this response. But a summary would probably be useful. Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon When the first reports came through of panic buying of toilet rolls and hand sanitiser I was more amused than alarmed, but it did prompt me to do a quick stock take of our cupboards and the fridge-freezer. I concluded that we could easily feed ourselves for over a week -longer if we were prepared to make great piles of spiced-up savoury rice and vegetables and put up with eating them for meal after meal. (Incidentally, that’s something I’d find easy to do, but my wife would balk at it, I know). We quickly decided that we weren’t going to bother trying to arrange home deliveries of groceries, and that we’d carry on as normal, or as normal as possible. Looking back through my diary I can see that I was never seriously worried that we wouldn’t be able to get enough food to eat. In fact, I frequently remark on how readily available fresh meat and vegetables were, the panic buying having been largely confined to tinned and dried foods like beans and pasta, and of course muck like Pot Noodles. There was one week, immediately after the pubs were forced to close and the supermarkets and off licences were stripped of wines and beers, when I had to make the best of what limited supplies were available and we were even driven to quaffing the borderline drinkable stuff the local newsagent sells, but even then we were in no danger of running out of gin, whisky and brandy, and we still had our small collection of superior wines to fall back on. We made a point of not panic buying or over-stocking with food, and in the event of a similar crisis in the future I hope other people will learn from their mistakes. At normal times we tend to take advantage of supermarket discounts on things we use a lot, like pasta, so without even realising it or meaning to do it we’d built up quite a reserve of ‘cupboard food’, and although we’ve only got a small freezer there was enough in it to furnish nine or ten meals. I can see that poorer families and people struggling on benefits wouldn’t have much opportunity to build up similar reserves, but I bet the average middle class home is as least as well off as we were. A couple of weeks ago I ran into a former neighbour, who’s retired but has a part time job working for Sainsbury’s as a delivery driver, and he told me that he and his colleagues, while driving along country and semi-rural roads on their way to customers’houses, have spotted mounds of packets of pasta and rice and other panic-bought food, now dumped under hedges and in fields by people who didn’t even know how to cook them and are too stupid (or embarrassed) to donate them to a food bank. Weird as it sounds I’ve come to enjoy the Tuesday morning Sainsbury’s shopping experience. I see the same faces in the queue every week, and there’s rather a jolly atmosphere while we wait to be allowed in. Once we’re in we’re funnelled along one wall and along to and up the travelators, and after we’ve paid we’re funnelled out via a different route marked out with lines of trolleys, but once inside the store we’re left to our own devices. I think they ration the numbers inside at any one time, so it never gets seriously busy, and it’s relatively easy to maintain social distancing if you care deeply about it, but by no means everyone does. I find that I’m keeping a closer eye on the fridge, and we’re making up shopping lists before we go out, because it’s much more trouble to obtain a missing ingredient in a hurry: if I realised I’d run out of onions, say, I’d have to walk all the way down to the Sainsbury’s Local and then queue for up to twenty minutes. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Largely the same. We still eat dinner at six and so on. I think the temporary disruption to the availability of some fresh foodstuffs has made us a little more likely to buy and eat ready meals from M&S: for example, yesterday evening we had a chicken, leek and bacon pie from their ‘gastropub’range, and just a day or two ago an Indian meal. I used to make my own sauces but now I’m as likely to open a jar or sachet from M&S. Also, I won’t throw out vegetables past their best; instead I’ll make up a soup. Entertainment and Leisure Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? Much the same as before, but of course we can’t go out to dinner, we can’t take day trips and we can’t go to concerts. Reading, listening to music and making sure we take some exercise, is what’s left to us and so far we haven’t found it too irksome. Talking to some of my fellow volunteers at the library has made me aware of how popular jigsaw puzzles have become. I might have been tempted to try one myself but there’s no room in this house with enough free space to lay out a good-sized puzzle, and in any case the cat would destroy it before I could complete it. I’ve helped my wife with what gardening we’ve been able to do. Plants and compost have been hard to come by but we’ve done what we can to liven up and refresh our container garden and the wall-mounted boxes and baskets. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. My radio listening is much the same as usual: Radio 3 throughout the day, except for the Radio 4 PM and six pm news. Coincidentally with the beginning of the lockdown I took out a subscription to Apple Music, which I’d been pondering doing for some time. I haven’t used it an awful lot and when I have it’s often been to listen to albums I missed out on in the past. As CDs have been difficult to buy, with the shops being shut and Amazon prioritising household goods and food over luxuries, I’ve also streamed or downloaded albums I’d otherwise have bought outright, most notably Sex by the Australian jazz improvisational band The Necks: I know that in future this piece will be the sound of the lockdown for me, as I’ve played it nearly every day. As for reading, I finished Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror & The Light, then read Haruki Murakami’s The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and I’ve made a start on Georges Perec’s Life: A User’s Manual.I’d have read those books anyway, so I couldn’t say they were chosen because in some way or other the lockdown had inspired me to read them. I did re-read Samuel Pepys’diary for 1665, and I downloaded a Kindle edition of Defoe’s A Journal of The Plague Year, which I last read as a teenager, and was surprised at how closely our modern experience and behaviour echoed our ancestors’. I don’t pay much attention to television at the best of times and if anything I’m even less inclined to look at it at present. We haven’t watched any ‘coronavirus special’programmes and as noted above I prefer radio for general news and announcements. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My habits haven’t changed at all. I remarked at one point in my diary that my brother, confined to the house, had neither shaved nor changed his outer clothes for several days (as evidenced by his appearance in FaceTime calls), but he seems to have settled down somewhat since then. The only thing I’d like but can’t readily get is a haircut. Luckily my hairdresser always does a very good job and the last cut I had, nearly three months ago, still looks reasonably tidy. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have M-3190 Male, 61, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. About a month in to the lockdown I found that I was having very vivid and realistic dreams, most of which concerned ‘real life’situations uppermost in my waking mind, like library business and going shopping for food. I can’t remember much detail now, but they tended to be of the ‘stuck record’variety, in which one finds oneself doing the same futile thing over and over in the hope of breaking whatever impasse one’s faced with. At the time I semi-jokingly put them down to my having drunk Ardbeg malt before going to bed -that stuff acts on me like a hallucinogen -but on reflection I do think the constant media coverage and the general strangeness of life out of doors might have been getting to me. Was there any evidence of a ‘collective neurosis’during the War, do you think? When you’ve got not just this country but an entire continent in some sort of lockdown and the great majority of people are submitting to having their behaviour directed by political authority it wouldn’t be surprising if some kind of psychological reaction occurred. Having said that, my wife didn’t report any especially weird dreams, and neither did my brother, who’s usually as fearfully concerned with his dreams as any biblical Pharaoh."

We sat ( social distancing) on the seating outside, pondering how life would be in the coming weeks. I rarely eat burgers, or visit takeaways, but we savoured every bite of the burger and sip of our milkshakes. Today 21st June we walked the same route having been told that the takeaway part would be opened ( the drive in was open a few weeks ago ) only to be disappointed that it was not the case at the moment. I did however have a cup of hot chocolate from a burger van which was in the nearby shopping area, which tasted exceptionally good. I had a reasonably stocked fridge and freezer and a few packets of longlife milk which I usually store in my shed during the winter. I was not worried about my supply of food. As the week was ending and being considered vulnerable because of my age, I became concerned, especially when the news bulletins were showing panic buying I wondered how I would manage. It was awful watching people squabbling over pasta, eggs and toilet rolls. Tired and stressed NHS staff were on social media asking people to calm down so that there was food available for them to buy for their families. I soon became aware that I had to go shopping as there was no-one else. Two weeks after lockdown I visited my local Spar which is a 10 minute walk to buy fruit , bread and milk There were no eggs or flour. I thought about using a company called Wiltshire Farm foods which delivers meals. I had arranged for a couple of my customers in the library who couldn’t cope on their own to use the firm and they were always pleased with the food. I decided against the idea as I have a good appetite and quite enjoy preparing my own food. I have never arranged an online delivery with the major supermarkets. I hate big supermarkets so previously used Aldi, my local Coop and every few months or so Marks and Spenser. The supermarkets have been really good in responding to the situation allowing NHS workers and older people to have dedicated time slots. I restocked my freezer by shopping in a bigger Coop about 2 miles away from my village and visit every 3 weeks supplementing from the Spar and smaller village Coop, continuing with my veg and fruit delivery. Non essential shops opened this week 22nd June in Wales , so along with a friend, wearing facemasks, we travelled on our local bus service to Talbot Green. I needed to buy replacement brushes for my electric tooth brush and had been searching online for any product that could help with removing plaque from my teeth and came across a sonic brush available in Boots. Catching the bus was fine, there was only one person on the bus. I bought a new pair o trainers from a Sports shop-plenty of room to shop and well marked out. Like wise in Boots and it was lovely to buy some food from M and S, including some underwear. My friend and I kept on our facemasks, which were by now irritating me, steaming up my glasses I don’t how NHS staff can work 12 hour shifts wearing all that PPE. Yesterday 29th June , I phoned the fruit and veg delivery company to request an order only to be told that as the local schools were retuning that they were to supplying them I thanked them for their service and they were grateful that and others were pleased with their products.I think more people One of the worries was the supply of labour to pick fruit and vegetables. There has always been EU nationals, especially Polish and Romanians coming to the Uk as seasonal workers. Travel restrictions and the Brexit vote made them feel unwanted so a campaign was launched called Pick for Britain. It was a way of getting furloughed workers to do the jobs. Thousands of people initially signed up for the scheme, but the actual numbers doing the hard work is very low. The reluctance of workers moving away and living in caravans is not appealing to the majority. What does this mean for our food supply come the end of the year when UK leaves the EU-that could be a problem We import a high percentage of food which was one of the reasons I never supported Brexit. It could prove a disaster for the security of food supply and the continuing pandemic. We wait to find out. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Entertainment and Leisure At the start of lockdown, my friends and I established a two person walking regime, I also spent several weeks sorting out my garden. I decided that I was going to keep myself occupied by gardening. The grass is usually cut by a gardener and I cut the shrubs and trees. The first weeks of lock down was spent digging out Montbretia corms which were multiplying, cutting the conifers and generally tidying the garden. Several weeks on I have had some work done in the garden. I needed remedial work on the pine end of my house after storm Denis and asked the builder if he would be able to remove a small part of the lawn which is always quite damp. He was pleased to have some extra work. I spent days digging out a large pampas plant whilst waiting for for the work. With some chippings and edging stones it really has transformed my garden. Before Cornonvirus,I spent a large part of my week in the library, either worker or joining in the activities, I always cut my grass but because of the amount of time I’m out and about Ive had the grass cut by M for the last 2 years. He decided to reduce the amount of time doing other peoples gardens so I now do my own. I cut the lawns at least once a week and weed trying to suppress the Montbretia from growing. It is a constant battle. I didn’t have much seating in the garden as I don’t usually spend hours sitting outside, especially if it’s hot, I bought a new bench from the local garden centre so that friends ( when allowed) can sit outside. IMG_20200624_135222[1167]As you can see from the photo I arranged the seating and 5 friends came for a coffee on afternoon as a couple of them were feeling very depressed. We had a lovely afternoon chatting and felt a lot happier. The amount of walking I do has certainly increased. Two or sometimes 3 friends walk at least 4/5 and once or twice 7 miles most days We have a walking rota. I don’t walk on a Tuesday and Friday to catch up on gardening, shopping and housework. My weight has dropped with a combination of increased exercise and healthy eating, and now weigh the same as 10 years ago. Although the weather was great in Spring, I didn’t think it safe to visit my Dad, even though I could have sat outside. He is coping well with shopping organised by my niece . I have visited him a couple of times, sitting outside, but the weather has not been so good and am waiting for warmer weather to return. I attended an older person’s Tai Chi class every Tuesday morning in our library. As it’s closed our instructor AW had permission from Age Cymru who organised AW and MM training to send us a video of the Tai Chi lesson. If the weather is too wet (I do walk in the rain ) I will use the video on my laptop. It is very calming. I might do it later as my local pharmacy has messed up my prescription for blood pressure medication ! For the last 8 weeks our dance exercise instructor for over 50s has been organising our class via Zoom. It is a lovely way of keeping in touch and a really fun way of keeping fit. It’s our last class on the 6th July and I will miss the music and the Joy I haven’t played any music at home since my husband died or played CDs in the car, something we always did when on a long journey. I've given them to charity shops and my CD player I do however listen to the radio a great deal, not listening live but certainly on BBC sounds. It will be mostly BBC radio 4 and 4 extra, plays especially. I love history and if there’s nothing on I’ll catch up on downloads of Melville Bragg In our Time series. Early this morning I listened to one on Mary Queen of Scots. I love the Archers and usually tune in on a Sunday afternoon. It’s been odd listening to monologues by different characters as they haven’t been able to record together. The Talking heads new series by Alan Bennett on tv has been excellent. It is a testament to his writing and the quality of acting which has resulted in an excellent series. I have also enjoyed The A word , a BBC series centred around a young boy with autism. The scenery of the Lake district, the humour, the quality of acting, especially from the boy was uplifting. I am watching the rerun of Broadchurch, Fine acting ( Love David Tennent and Olivia Coleman) BBC Channel 4 on Saturday nights always has great programmes, whether its Inspector Montalbano ( I have booked a holiday to Sicily nest year since watching the programme over many years )or Nordic noir. The only soap I watch is Neighbours, which can be predicable. I have hours of history programmes recorded-Bettany Hughes series on Greek Islands, Michael Woods on Alfred the Great and Tutankhamen. A friend and I had booked an overnight stay in London in April with our local Coach Tour company to see Tutankhamen’s treasures at the Saatchi gallery in London, It was cancelled We have a credit note I’m not sure if the exhibition will be kept until next year or it has returned to Egypt An alternative.trip would be to Greenwich to visit the National Maritime Museum and Queen’s House next year. If the situation continues into autumn /winter I might buy some paint and paint part of my hallway which suffered from a little water damage from storm Denis. I have painted part of a kitchen wall which had a few marks from grease and in the garden I have painted my shed and a couple of fence panels I have finished reading Shackleton’s book on the expedition to the Antartic. He is my hero. The way he kept up the spirit of his crew all to survive was remarkable. I am now reading a World Book night book Rising Tide a Swedish crime thriller which I have had on my book shelf from 2015. I usually listen to audio books via the library online resources, but because the libraries are closed , the audio books have been “borrowed” I have been using You tube to access the radio versions of Poirot and Miss Marlpe, Paul Temple, Oscar Wilde plays an Ideal Husband and The Importance of being Ernest, Sherlock Holmes, especially Clive Merrison and Michael William version I have had sleep problems for years I don’t let it bother me-hence listening to the radio and You tube through out the night It’s a shame I can’t retain all the information that I listen to but perhaps I know more that I realise. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Personal Hygeine It’s a wet day today, mid day and I’m still in my pyjamas. Usually on a Wednesday a friend and I go for a walk. She will not walk in the rain, but I would, so I thought I would spend some time completing the summer directive. I have hovered and washed the kitchen floor and don’t intend doing any more housework.I was busy yesterday, cleaning my Dad’s kitchen. It’s a nuisance wearing a mask as the weather wasn’t good enough for him to sit outside, Don’t kow how people can work a long day wearing PPE. They have my admiration. I’ll have egg and cress sandwiches for lunch and then cook a roast chicken dinner later this evening, I’ve brushed my teeth twice and cleansed my face with cleanser and toner. Shower after lunch. Prior to the outbreak, I would shower including washing my hair every morning after breakfast as I was often out and about. If the weather was hot I showered before bedtime ( only have a shower as I had the bath removed 4 years ago so it’s so easy to use the walk-in shower ) As my routine has changed and walking more especially as they are morning walks I’ll shower later in the day or before bedtime. I must confess I haven’t showered every day, depending on how hot it has been and how far and how strenuous the walk. If I have skipped it would only be one day my hair especially would require washing, If I have been busy in the garden I would sometimes shower twice a day There is something relaxing about having a warm shower wearing freshly laundered pyjamas going to bed with the clean sheets. I’ve been cutting my hair every couple of weeks. Lots of my friends are looking forward to nest week 13th July when hairdressers are open in Wales. Most of the walking group have managed to get appointments for the first week. When my husband was alive, I visited the hairdressers every 8 weeks, having it coloured using foils. Looking after him meant I didn’t have time to spend so I let the colour grow out as as it’s not grey quite a natural colour I stopped going to the hairdressers, attending the local college of Further Education and using the students. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.One of my friends thinks I am a cheap skate, but as I always give them a good tip, there is not a lot of difference in the cost. I don’t know how the colleges will be able to offer Beauty and Hair courses in the autumn. It’s a trying time for all students. I also go for a pedicure from time to time and that’s what I am missing, more than having my hair cut and blow dried. On my first bus ride to the nearest shopping area two weeks ago, I bough a sonic plague remover from Boots,I looked online about teeth cleaning as I am concerned about my teeth, Every 4 months I was having periodontal cleaning with my NHS dentist to avoid any further deterioration with gum disease. I also bought new brushes for my electric tooth brush, replacing the heads more frequently than usual. I have brought the brush to my kitchen cupboard to remind myself I to use it more than twice a day and keep it charged. Dentists will be a long time getting back to normal. They are only seeing urgent cases here in Wales, routine assessments and care will only be reinstated between January and March next year. Hope I don;t need a filling before then! F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Sleep Ever since the menopause, almost 20 years ago, I have experienced sleep problems. I have never sought medical help, coping reasonably well. I would often sleep in a separate bedroom from my husband when I was working as he would be awake for long periods during the night, reading, He had retired quite early due to health problems so his sleep pattern was awake during the night and sleep until midday. When he needed more care due to terminal bowel cancer which meant he had a stoma, I was constantly having to help him changing his appliances throughout the night. This meant that my sleep pattern became even worse. He died in 2014 and my sleep has not improved,. I listen to to the radio and audio books and catch up programmes on the renamed BBC Sounds. Since the coronvirus , my sleep is no worse or certainly no better I have resigned myself to the fact I need very little sleep. I may have a cat nap if I’m not busy in the afternoon,especially as like today it’s raining. ( I went to bed at 4.00 pm after having a 4 mile walk and slept until 6.30 ) My favourite catchup sleep day is Sunday afternoon, walking in the morning and going to bed to listen on catchup radio to the Archers omnibus. I love listening to plays and found lots on You tube. I need to have sound throughout the night I have tried silence, but that makes me more restless. I have had several odd disturbing dreams, but fortunately forget them quite quickly. The two most recent that I can recall was my husband telling me that my stomach was swollen ( which it is not I am waiting to make an appointment for a slight prolapse so it is probably connected with that. The other one was I was trying to open my eyes on waking up, but I couldn't. They were tightly shut. Since my husband’s death, I have had several holidays abroad, sharing a room with a lady friend. She always reads for 20 minutes or so. As soon as the book is placed to one side she falls asleep. I’ve tried doing the same, but failed to improve my sleep. Although she doesn’t snore, I can hear hear her breathing and to overcome the problem this is when I listen on my tablet to any plays or talking books. I am always pleased to be able to connect to the internet in hotel bedrooms. If this is not possible, I always take DABs which are small devices which you can hear through a earpiece. Easily transportable run an a small battery. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Technology A week or so before lock-down my small tablet had stopped playing video and audio. I searched online for solution but couldn’t find anything so took it for repair but unfortunately it was unrepairable. I was able to search internet, email, use Facebook and Twitter. The secretary of the library where I volunteer suggested I use the laptop and Apple I pad as the library will be closed for so it me time I was so pleased to be able to access BBC sounds and download audio books from the local authority’s library online catalogue. Although I embrace technology, I am a old fashioned when it comes to mobile phones, and I must be the only one of my friends that possess a bog standard pay as you go phone. I am certainly not mean or frugal but I will buy an updated phone when mine breaks or is lost. Last year the Monday club who meet at the library received a grant for producing pod-casts about reminiscing. This was done with the help of the Secretary of the Monday club (AW) and her daughter whose job is marketing and communications. DA recorded a group of Monday club members talking about a range of topics over several weeks, They are very entertaining and we were all pleased with the results although that can be attributed to DA’s editing. AW and DA wondered if we could keep in touch throughout this awful period by continuing the podcasts and am pleased to say that every other Friday we record a session on Zoom which DA edits and places online on the Monday. It’s not the same people each time, for example we have had AW two granddaughters and our over 50s dance instructor speaking how they are managing their classes via Technology RL our instructor works across the age range with A and it was lovely to hear her publicise the classes that are being accessed online. Our speaker organiser OC is staying with her daughter in Spain, travelling just before travel restrictions She is over 80 although in good health, her daughter felt she was at less risk in Spain that UK. It has been lovely connecting with her from her white washed villa, swimming pool and mountain views. Interesting to hear how the coronvirus has been managed there, with much more restrictions on daily life. I am also using Skype to connect with friends and my family in Bath. I have just finished a session on Zoom with friends from the library hosted by AW. She is arranging for Zoom sessions from next Monday morning for any member of the Monday club for a “chat and char” session. The Secretary of the library has been doing an excellent job of maintaining the library’s profile by sharing on our Facebook page really interesting free online courses, events, talks which I repost. This is the most I do on Facebook. I rarely post anything personal, comment on a political stance or get involved in petitions. I have un-followed a couple of Facebook friends because of their Brexit comments I use Twitter for keeping up to date with political references and follow people that I have a connection with My son uses Twiiter frequently and it’s been a great way of keeping up to date with him in his professional capacity and on times personal. I have 75 followers and follow 57.My son follows 9, 602 people and has 8, 746 followers. Amazing! F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau The Government Where do you start when you consider the response to the Conservative Government actions in dealing with the Pandemic. From the 23rd March broadcast by Boris Johnson and the shut-down of a large sector of the UK economy, it was obvious that there was going to be an enormous number of job losses and business failures. Little did we know at the start, that the UK would suffer so many avoidable deaths. As of today 8th June New Zealand has reported no new Covid 19cases for more then 2 weeks. The P The New Zealand PM has lifted almost all of its coronvirus restrictions. Under new rules, social distancing is not required and there no limits on public gatherings, but borders remain closed to foreigners. What has UK done today. Introduced new rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self isolate for 14 days. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train including Uk nationals must give an address where they will self isolate. This decision is typical of the Johnson Government making irrational decisions. This should have been done at the start “To begin at the beginning” The first cases of coronavirus in the Uk were on January 29th when two Chinese nationals fell in in York The first death was on March 5th, when a woman in her 70s was confirmed to have died from the virus. Meanwhile Johnson was advising people to prevent a wider outbreak to wash your hands with soap and water whilst singing Happy birthday twice. A few weeks before he became seriously ill with coronvirus, he was still shaking hands and appeared to have quite a casual attitude to the situation that was developing. It was a shock when it was announced that he had been admitted to intensive care. I felt that because of his attitude he had put himself at risk. He had not convened a COBRA meeting. The public were being told that catching the infection was the same as having Flu and that people over 70 and had underlying health conditions were the most at risk Exercise Cygnus was carried out in October 2016 to evaluate how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronvirus Ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment. Combined with austerity cuts to the NHS, Social Services underfunding, it has had a disastrous effect on people lives, employment and mental health for years to come. The lack of Personal Protection Equipment and testing especially in care homes has resulted in multiple deaths . Older people in hospital were discharged into care homes without being tested, putting carers and clients at great risk. BAME staff in the NHS seem to have greater risk of death which is quite shocking. A typical response by this Government has been to say to foreign NHS that as part of the National effort to combat coronvirus doctors, nurses and paramedics will automatically have their visas extended for one year free of charge David Lammy a Labour London MP tweeted that NHS workers who are risking their live to save British lives should be allowed to stay in the UK permanently I couldn’t agree more The Chancellor has been the one Government minister who has shown some semblance of sound judgement in the way he had dealt with the economic fall out of minions of people furloughed from their jobs. The scheme has been extended until October but I know people who have been made redundant since being furloughed. The economic situation will be dire for a long while. I have more faith in the way that the Welsh Government have dealt with the situation. At the moment we can only to travel no more than 5 miles and to exercise locally. People from England who travel to beauty spots in Wales are sent home, so we do not have crowded beaches as in England. Non essential shops are still closed although there will be a review within the next week At some point, there will be a review of what has happened, but when you read about the number of excess deaths in the Uk since the beginning of the outbreak has passed 63,000 according to the figures from the ONS might It is an appalling statistic These figures might have been caused by factors connected to wider changes for example reluctance by some people to visit a doctor or hospital or having long term health conditions made worse by having to remain at home. I am not not satisfied at all at the way this Government has dealt and continues to deal with crisis. Friends say about hindsight. They knew what was coming. I’ll prepared, making statements and promises that are not kept F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau The News Since Brexit, I have stopped watching BBC news at 6.00 pm as I felt the corporation was becoming a mouthpiece for the Government. I watch the 6.30 BBC Wales news for information on the situation in Wales. My source for latest developments are reading on-line news, BBC news, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Guardian, Independent, Wales on-line, Huffington post. The Guardian and Independent are now headlines only as understandably they are relying on subscriptions for the full article. I watch Channel 4 news either at 7.00pm or plus one at 8.00, but more often than not, record to watch later in the evening. I feel the reporters ask more probing questions and do not show dereference to Government Ministers ( If they choose to appear as more often than not they fail to appear when asked ) Most mornings I go for my daily walk, so I don not watch the Welsh government’s daily briefing at 12.30 and do not watch the UK Government’s briefing, preferring to read the content. I find the whole thing depressing , hearing the daily death figures. The Welsh Government like Scotland has a BSL interpreter and it is quite shocking that the Uk Government do not feel the need relying on the BBC news Channel to provide interpretation. There was an article about the BSL interpreter for Wales saying how she is now recognised when out and about and feels that the Welsh Government has led by example. I am not aware of anyone finding it a problem, although several friends have hearing impairment and have hearing aids. I’m sure it must be very frustrating and example of needs of disadvantaged are not met. I seems such a small request, but it is very petty. Hopefully a petition can rectify the problem. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Work and Home Life I am retired from my job as the Librarian where I worked for 42years. I am a trustee, volunteer and committee member of the group that run the volunteer managed library. I was still, therefore “working”Until 20th March. Although the situation I the country was becoming gloomier, the library was continuing to operate. We had arranged a speaker for the 16th March to talk about walking to Base Camp Everest, but decided to cancel. Our Secretary emailed the committee to ask our opinions on closing the library. She was already working from home from her job as a project manager for a bank. I suggested we enquire what the local authority’s library policy was and act accordingly. After the PM’s broadcast later that day, I felt that the library should close, but in order for our valued customers to come and borrow as many books as they needed, I asked the committee to consider closing on the Friday evening. That was the agreed. The volunteers were already taking great care and I cleaned the public computers after every use. I phoned as many customers that I could to advise them of our imminent closure. I worked the last session on my own on the Friday evening 5.00-7.00 It was very sad as we usually have a knit and natter group on a Friday evening and there is always a lovely atmosphere The few borrowers that visited the library were very appreciative that they had been informed. I locked the library and felt very sad as it was obvious that reopening would would be many weeks away. The library is a great asset to the village, as there is a group called the Monday club which is although independent is considered an integral part of the library. I am a volunteer with the group ,vice chair and liaison between the library and Monday club committee. The Monday club arranges speakers, arts and crafts, arm chair exercise, Tai Chi.Nordic walking group We have theatre and cinema visits, luncheon clubs for a member’s birthday. There is something for everyone. I thought I would be depressed at missing all our activities, but because I have been able to walk and garden ( as mentioned in the Health section ) I am coping well. I am more anxious about my family in Bath who are shielding. My 97 year old DAD is ok, missing his weekly pint and sing song at the local social club. We keep in touch via Zoom ( more in the next section) and try and keep upbeat. I sat outside in my back garden with one my fellow volunteers yesterday afternoon who I met on my daily walk earlier on the in week. She was very tearful, so invited her for a coffee. She lives with her husband and because she is diabetic, her son does their shopping. She was worried about the arm chair exercise group and Tai Chi people that she tutors in the library. She and the other Tai Chi instructor contact each person at least once a fortnight. I asked if there was anyone particular that I could help. We had a lovely chat , she arrived at 2.30 and left at 4.45, hopefully feeling less depressed. Yesterday morning a friend and I were out for a walk and a chap who we were aware of and who has had mental health issues, was walking his dog and I could hear his voice raised, He was shouting how awful the world was and how he was fed up. We didn’t know what to do. I felt that we should do something but don’t know where he lives. It’s an awful time and will get worse as the economy suffers. B1752 F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Part 2 Corvid Health I think I’m coping far better than I thought I would when it was announced on the 16th March by the Prime Minister advising everyone in the UK against non essential travel, as well as advising people not to visit pubs, restaurants .People over the age of 70 ( myself ) and those with certain health conditions should stay at home. Where possible, people should work from home. A group of friends who normally meet at the local library decided that we would continuing our walking but keep the distancing requirements and met on the Sunday to walk our local community path. It was quite busy with families but everyone was adhering to keeping space. We arranged to meet on Tuesday morning. That changed after the Prime Minister’s broadcast on the 23rd March. It was devastating news. People would only be allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons Shopping for basic necessities as infrequently as possible One form of exercise alone or with members of your household Travelling to or from work but only if absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home No meeting of friends. All non essential shops were to close. There was a lot of phoning after the broadcast as we knew we could not meet for the foreseeable future. We were very tearful as we are mostly widowed or divorced and live on our own, I decided that I was going to keep myself occupied by do some gardening. The grass is usually cut by a gardener and I cut the shrubs and trees. The first weeks of lock down was spent digging out Montbretia corms which were multiplying, cutting the conifers and generally tidying the garden. The gardener was unable to come so I cut the grass. The only reason I asked M to start cutting the grass was because I spent so much time in the library and going out and about. We were keeping in touch by phone, but we realised that for the sake of mental well being we would device a walking rota of 2 people. This we have continued to do and has made such a difference. I used to be a volunteer path walker where once a month myself and a friend would walk the local paths which were called Bunny walks on behalf of Llantrisant Community Council. It has been enjoyable taking the girls to areas nearby which they were unaware of. Gardening and walking 5 days a week has meant that I am f"

Berkshire in family isolation having moved here on Friday 20 March 2020 from Bristol where I live on my own. Tuesday 28th. April Virus or not? To date the only people I know who have had the virus is my ex-husband and his wife and I only learnt that through a friend, not having seen either of them for years.  I’m not ill with the virus though have acquired the insidious label of ‘elderly and infirm’ because of having Hypertension and COPD. I could divert myself here about the power of labels and accuracy of language used – I might indulge later. Wider effects of the virus Although I’ve not been ill with the virus, I’ve been hugely effected by it. Apart from uprooting with the consequences of learning to live with others after being on my own for 27 years; acquiring this label as I’ve only ever thought of myself as ‘getting older’ (a huge difference between this and being ‘elderly’ for me); my norm is now totally different; my sleep is worse than ever; I feel tired a lot of the time; but I think worst of all I find it enormously difficult to motivate myself. It would be so very easy just to drift and let the day go by especially when the weather, up until today, has been so very gorgeous.  I’ll elaborate later but want to get a general picture down first this MO being an example of just how lax and undisciplined I feel which does not sit easily with me. Effect of restrictions I can go out once a day for a constitutional but not shopping or any other more social or communal activity. I find this enormously restricting as generally I would be carrying out some sort of voluntary activity as part of my weekly norm and now I do none, other than try and contribute to the daily round here in my daughter’s house. What I try and do is phone friends who live on their own, particularly if they are elderly – ie. Even older than me! I have a couple of women friends in their mid and late ‘80s, one of whom is greatly active with a large garden and a mill pond to look after and the other in a Care Home. I am learning a great deal about how my children’s generation live, specifically of course my daughter and son-in-law.  They have been and are so generous in having me here to live with them; I try not to forget that in my occasional irritation with their life style.  Fortunately they have a large house which is in effect two cottages joined together so there is in effect a North and a South Wing.  It was one the old pharmacy in the village, has many outhouses as well as a large garden in which I do try and work. Today it is wet and miserable so I won’t be doing anything outside and I’ve had my constitutional. I also realise I’m putting down all sorts of issues that can be elaborated and explored; I think they all have interest because they’ve invariably arisen out of the current situation. I can do this as the days go by but I want to get down something under the main headings as it were that were offered…. UK Government’s response In a nutshell, devastating and odd; we’re now reaping the whirlwind as a response. What’s just flashedinto my mind is that I’m reading one of the Shardlake novels by C J Sansom, set in the 1540s and it strikes me that life was viewed as far more apocalyptic then than we tend to do now. It’s affecting my thinking…. I think that buffoon Johnson took his usual gung-ho response to life, ‘the man who would be king’ and we were far too late in taking basic precautions like social distancing, closing social type meeting places et al.  This combined with severe cut backs to health and social care over the past few years in response to austerity measures has left us floundering.  This following hard on the heels of our shameful exit from the EU; timing couldn’t be more dire. We are a littleisland all on our own through our own arrogance and pig-headedness. Rough justice that said ‘king’ was struck down with the virus; shamefully I did hope he might die which was thoroughly uncharitable of me.  But like the phoenix or JC he’s risen again… What I find puzzling is that here a lot of attention is paid to protect the elderly and infirm.  But we are the elements in society who will, in the great scheme of things, die first. We do need a mix of ages to function well but are those who are not elderly being sacrificed to some extent to look after the elderly and infirm? A great deal of attention is being paid to the physical aspects of this killer condition but somewhat later to the mental and emotional too.  Those with existing mental health conditions who are already isolated by this apart from all else are suffering particularly. There are many individuals who are terrified of being alone – stay in relationships long beyond their functioning. I’ve not seen this same emphasis in other countries though I may have missed this. My sense is that there has been a far more communal approach to being isolated whether old or young, sick or otherwise. It’s interesting too I think that the English are not widely regarded as being sociable or particularly gregarious peoples and yet we seem to find it enormously hard to tolerate isolation and after only six weeks or so are braying for exit strategies. It seems that apart from the US which has another buffoon at its helm, Europe and China have been far more draconian in their separate measures but consequently more effective too. Sources of information Can’t get back to proper spacing annoyingly. I read the Guardian Monday to Saturday and the London Review of Books every fortnight or so when it comes out. The latter has some particularly good essays on the situation. They’re always stimulating and thought provoking.  Since being here I listen to the radio far less and look at films on television far more, not television itself.  Occasionally see the news but again far less than I used to when I tended to look at Channel 4.  Increasingly am inclined to think the television news is pap to feed the masses. I believe less and less that is stated. 01.05.2020 It has hailed, rained and now the sun is shining. This could feel like April showers.  However …One of the things about this strangest of times is how metaphor comes ever more galloping into its own.  Hard not to think of the weather therefore as some sort of judgment on us; the Gods throwing down various challenges to how it has been and perpetuating the oddness of it all to confirm how it is now. Sleep seems to be one of the common denominators that affects many of us. Daughter told me that one theory suggested that we are grieving for how it was, how that is now lost and gone for ever (shades of Darling Clementine). When she said this, although not new to me it felt to be and I could feel tears springing to my eyes. For two pins I could have wept. The thought of no live theatre for months to come feels dire. That affects me most of all the activities I go to which feed my body and soul and which mean so much to me… But I digress, so easy for me to do that. Back to sleep… often I have to resort to a Sleepeazy which is an antihistamine which usually but not always does it stuff and although the night will be broken – bladder is king at night – at least provides more than a couple of hours sleep. I try not to take these night after night. They are addictive I know and the relief of being able to fall into sleep is in itself relaxing. When I don’t I may well go to the loo at least two or three times in the night, I can read for an hour or two continuously or in a couple of goes.  At best I might get three or four hours sleep, worst, none at all.  I can keep going but the quality of the day is so compromised.  I have to be at my most disciplined on the days following less sleep.  It happens anyway and I put it down to getting older and a condition which can affect many of us but it seems to be more frequent now that I am in family isolation. One of the other aspects of living away from home as I enter the start of Week 7 en famille is not only sleeplessness but a feeling of incompleteness of unsatisfactoriness.  Generally I like to have a sense of achievement and of having something completed and finished. Now even if I do, I find this feeling elusive. I know I am not living in my own home. I know too I am living with others and this is generally not my norm – yet I have feelings of both dread and anticipation about getting back to my norm. I want to and I don’t want to.  I feel my energy is somehow sapped; I don’t have the same oomph to get on and do things as I would on the daily round. I do get up at the same time Monday to Friday, ‘schooldays’ as my son would say – a phrase I much enjoy -and it makes the weekend then different. I have breakfast then I generally clear the dishwasher and put things away, refill it usually and wash up those things that I (not always the family) consider can more economically be washed – like saucepans from the night before.  Often things are put in and re-put in if not satisfactory and they just get baked further with whatever clings. I find it an extraordinarily profligate way of operating but then they are. Automatically turn on lights when really not necessary then leave them on.  It is indeed a world that has always enjoyed plenty and though mindful of the planet don’t seem to consider these domestic ways of saving. I am such a war baby….. I’ve deviated again . . it is perhaps all about living with other ‘rules and conventions’ and though it is my family, I cannot always do what I might usually do. For instance I made the fatal mistake of asking for ordinary tea to be put on the shopping list for grand daughter to fetch on her weekly stint at Tesco’s, only to be told I had enough to be getting on with. I then said, the fatal thing which I knew even as it came out of my mouth, I usually kept a spare so that when I ran out I had a replacement. Daughter instantly rounded on me and said we don’t all live in the same way as you do, crushingly and condemningly. I felt such a fool as I knew this would be the response.  Almost as if I wanted to bring all her scorn down on me and she can be very harsh.  All I could feebly say I thought as there was a packet of Earl Grey in the cupboard and I thought that was what they usually did. I was told in no uncertain terms that it had probably been on offer. This was followed up by I had only to ask and she would get it.  But it isn’t so as when I do, I can be met with a martyred sort of sigh as if that’s the most inconvenient or most damn fool thing to ask at this precise moment. Enough said…. We trod very carefully around one another thereafter.  Daughter can be very like my Grandmother whom I learnt to approach with anything other than the norm, at the day went by and her temper became sweeter.  I don’t think of myself this way but wonder whether I am… A glimpse and a hint of ‘family isolation’… here endeth today’s missive. 05.05.2020 And on it goes…. I find it hard to believe that I’m now half way through my seventh week (I could say in exile but that would be churlish) of living en famille. Sleep becomes harder and harder even with a pill.  After days of only 2 or 3 hours sleep if I’m lucky and then cat napping rather unsatisfactorily it’s beginning to bite. I worry about the increased possibility of getting Alzheimer’s or some other dementia sooner than I might otherwise. I find it a suspenseful time…."

Both of us seem to be suffering from catarrh as a result of being stuck inside for a while. We really don’t know if wehave had Covid19 but would not be surprised if wehad. My wife worked in London and was travelling for 3 hours a day on packed trains and tubes in February and early March. My workplace had a number of confirmed cases before we stopped teaching and the officer cadets are always a hot bed of disease which travels from one to the other very rapidly as they live in close proximity to each other all day long. As we have never been tested we just don’t know; maybe the much vaunted antibodytest willrevealinteresting things. Our mental health seems to be holding up. Both of us have got a bit bored of the lockdown, but that was always inevitable. I think we managed about 5 weeks before it began to become a bit of a strain. It feels unfair to moan about that really, so many people have been working exceptionally hard and in the case of doctors, nurses, hospital staff, and care workers getting ill and dying in rather high numbers. Equally so many people have lost loved ones in appalling circumstances. In comparison, moaning that we’ve been inside for rather a long time with only one walk a day seems silly. My work has been quite stressful as working out how to convert our courses to an online model and then a socially distanced teaching model proved a great headache. My departmental boss, and the overall faculty boss, made life worse by being rather disengaged and vague; all added to the stress on myself and 3 colleagues of us trying to solve things. But again, this work stress feels inconsequential compared to what others at the frontline of all this must be experiencing. The Government In late March after the lockdown was instituted I, rather bizarrely, found myself quite sympathetic to the government. The situation was new and very difficult, all the options were terrible, and clearly a large loss of life and economic suffering was about to happen. I am no fan of Johnson or his cabinet of loyalists who lack talent and intellect, but I did not want them to fail at this. I also felt that, in comparison to the buffoon Trump in the US, Johnson was at least listening to the scientific advice. All the scientists and medics who have headed the daily briefings have been deeply impressive; they are intelligent, thoughtful and measured in their statements and answers to questions, treating the public as adults. I find, as time goes on, that I cannot sustain this view. Since late April and into early May it has become increasingly clear that the government is flailing around with little idea of what it is doing. A rather brilliant article about the strategy making of the government, written by Lawrence Freedman, makes a strong case that key decisions were delayed or botched. The lockdown probably came a week too late, maybe even two weeks and many businesses and universities acted before the government. What’s the point of the government if private entities act before it does and set the mood music? Things really fell apart in the run up to the 8 May VE-Day bank holiday weekend. The incessant briefing to the media confused matters about a massive relaxation in restrictions coming soon, which ministers then had to row back from in their daily broadcasts. Then Johnson gave what must be one of the worst Prime Ministerial broadcasts ever on the evening of Sunday 10 May. My wife and I listened on the radio and at the end of it both us were utterly baffled as to what he’d asked everyone to do. The only clear thing was the relaxation of restrictions on outdoor exercise from 13 May. It seemed like he’d told everyone who couldn’t work from home to go back to work on 11 May, but when I looked at the officialdocument on the government’s strategyit was clear in saying any change in the lockdown would always be communicated at least 48 hours before it was implemented. What was clear just from skimming the document was that Johnson had not read it, or if he had, he did not understand it;I am inclined to the former, he’s lazy and treats his office in an insouciant fashion that is now costing lives. I can only hope that his backbenchers remove him from office at some point, or he leaves decisions to the more competent ministers. He’s really not up to the challenge of leading the country through this crisis period. I feel a great dealof sympathyfor Hancock as health secretary, he’s struggling to do his best and looks like a man who is physically and mentally knackered by all of this. Perhaps that is unsurprising, but I think he is trying even if he is a bit cack-handed in how he presents things. Gove appears, from various newspaper articles, to be moving leavers behind the scenes and is at least intellectually up to the task. He always seems serious and rather dour when he speaks to the nation, probably the correct tone for the moment and something Johnson struggles with. The only minister who seems to be doing well is Rishi Sunak at the Treasury. He has both seriousness, intellect, and empathy; his decisions as Chancellor have allbeen pretty much spot on and when he’s got something wrong he’s admitted it and then corrected things. I would not be surprised if in a year or two the Tory party looks at him and decides to replace Johnson with Sunak, he looks like the man for the future, Johnson represents something that has failed and is no longer fit for the moment. Also worth saying that Keir Starmer as the new Labour leader has been very impressive. His tone is exactly right, he is intelligent, and his questioning of the PM and government ministers is very good. I think in different (i.e. normal) times he would have fallen a bit flat, but at this moment he looks like more of a PM than Johnson. Serious times call for serious people, Starmer is one of them. In terms of future steps, I expect the government’s current ‘timetable’ (wrong word as the strategy document is clear the dates are aspirational and can be pushed back) will probably be seen as too quick and actually we’ll stayin lockdown longer. Idoubt that 1 June will see any more relaxations and the aspiration to have some leisure and food venues open in July seems veryunlikely. I hope I’mwrong, but who knows. News Mainly we’ve been getting news fromthe BBC News website, Radio 4 bulletins, the Guardian website, and a little bit from accessible stories on the FT (really good number crunching analysis). Early on I did watch the 5pm broadcasts, but I haven’t reallyfollowed them for the last 4 weeks; they get summarised on the Guardian so I generally just look at that. The ministers speaking don’t really say very much that is of use; the overarching changes only come every 4 weeks or so, not much point in following the daily grind. Some of the lying by ministers has been annoying, e.g. Hancock claiming PPE was provided in adequate amounts to care workers (everyone knows this is rubbish), or the fiddling of the test figures to meet the 100,000 target. I haven’t personallyhad anyproblems accessing the news nor have anypeople I know, but the idea of a BSL interpreter seems sensible. Work and Home Life I have been working during lockdown and have been working from home the whole time, barring one dayin the office for asociallydistanced meeting to plan next term’s teaching. The start to lockdown was quite confused as myself and two other members of my department decided on 19 March that we should be working from home and not coming into work (where there were lots of Covid19 cases among officer cadets). This led to a bit of an argument with my boss who wanted to keep teaching face-to-face with cadets despite government advice and the comparable university sector shutting down. All three of us have vulnerable relatives that we care for and were worried about passing on any infections to them. From conversations with other colleagues I know a lot of people I work with were uncomfortable coming in to teach until 25 March, two days after the formal lockdown started. My boss essentially bullied people into coming into work, describing people like me who did not come in as ‘traitors’, ‘cowards’ and ‘weak’; he also told me that the whole virus thing was overblown and that the government’s response ‘verged on the hysterical’. Writing this 2 months later his comments in early March now look ridiculous and callous. Fortunately, he has now sort of woken up to the risks and to the fact that most of the department think he behaved badly back in March, although hardly anyone trusts him anymore and I am not convinced he is making the best decisions for the people he manages. After those shenanigans, April was spent trying to design a new online course for the War Studies part of the academic course. This proved a nightmare as the has yet to equip us with laptops that can access our work emails (they are tied to a physical terminal in my office at work) and most of my colleagues are not IT literate. In the end we came up with a correspondence course which we’ve been running in May before we return to teach face-to­face (socially distanced) on 29 May. The overall boss of the Faculty seems to dislike the correspondence course model – we were told wewere ‘out of step with the Academy’ – as it doesn’t use MS Teams to run virtualseminars. He’s not reallyqualified to judge these things as he is an ex-army officer with no uni-level teaching experience, and just seems to think we’re luddites. In reality, the correspondence course is robust, works via email, and the cadets have done some really good work; it actually intellectually challenges them and gets them thinking a bit more deeply about what we teach. When wego back to work on 29 Maywe’re teaching in armytents, outside with the side flaps up, so effectively in the open air. All the cadets are going to be spaced 2m apart and we will be further away than that, hopefully. We’re also doing a few lectures in a massive lecture theatre capped at 10% capacity with the cadets again socially distancing. This will onlybe 1/3 of our students but the other 2/3 will watch it live streamed;I expect the army’s rubbish tech will fail here but as it is not my responsibilityI don’t really care. Part of me is a bit wary about returning and seeing so many people, albeit at 2m distance, but another part of me thinks we have to crack on with life as close to normal as possible. This thing is not going to disappear, and the army needs its future officers to be trained, so we have to come up with some sort ofsolution. It’s abit ad hoc but it might work, at least in the summer months. So, althoughI’ve been working from home for 7 weeks the period has probably been the most intense and stressful period of work I have ever known. Far worse than finishing my doctorate or doing uni exams or anything like that. It has been a 7-day a week job, the last weekend I had to myself was in early March (and the 6 months before that were very busy at work as well). Emails, sometimes over 100 a day, and telephone calls, plus virtual meetings have been constant. Our departmental boss does his work mainly in the late afternoon and evening and expects replies at ridiculous hours; the faculty boss keeps changing things, and the militaryfiddle as welland can’t decidewhat theywant. Allin all, it has been chaotic, confusing, and very tiring. About 4 of us in the department of 15 have done 99% of the work, and we’re all pretty knackered and angry at how things have played out. In return we’re getting a tinybit of extra money as an admin allowance (hardly covers my printing costs or phone calls) and slightly less teaching next term. I very much feel like my employer is burning the candle at both ends at the moment and at some point a sizeable chunk of the faculty are going to down tools. People are burnt out, mentally and physically. We get lots of emails from the MOD and our army command saying that theyare ‘caring for our people’, but I’ve seen no evidence of this at all. Nobodyhas asked how I amand none of my colleagues have been contacted either to check up onthemeither; it feels like we’ve been abandoned. Home life is pretty much the same as usual, just withless going out. Mywife’s job was always going to come to a close at the end of April as it was a fixed term contract (in the end she got extended to the end of May due to the incompetence of HR). So, I knew she would be at home more and we’d get to spend more time together. Her plans for the summer, to go travelling around and visit friends and relatives, have been thrown up in the air. I’ma little worried that she won’t be able to get anew job in the autumn or next year as she’llbe entering a job market going through aterrible recession. We’lljust have to wait and see. We can pay our bills and the mortgage at the moment, but I worry that spending cuts will come along next year and hit the MOD hard. The lockdown actually coincided with the period that normally sits between the spring and summer terms in which I would have gone on holiday and done research. The holiday never happened due to the lockdown and the research has been lost due to the closing of archives and the massive amount of work created to keep the course running. So, in some respects things are the same, I’mworking fromhome as I often do, but in other respects the plans I had have all been thrown by the wayside. Technology We have been doing a weekly quiz night with 4 of my old school friends and their partners, using Zoom. That has been great fun and anice chance to catchup withpeople. We’ve also done a zoomchat with two of our unifriends who live in Montrealand Boston; we hadn’t spoken to them for ages so I think the crisis may have prompted us to keep in touch a bit more. I’ve done a number ofsocial chats with3 of my work colleagues who Ilike (one is another old uni friend who has just started working with us, so I’ve chatted to her even more). Generally, these involve drinking and griping about our idiot bosses; a useful safety valve for people to blow off steam. I also managed to get my technophobe aunt to use MS Teams so we could chat and I am going to try to do the same for my father. It was rather a trial with my aunt, but we got there in the end, not sure it’llbe any easier with mydad. I occasionally look at various different twitter feeds, mainly of colleagues and friends, sometimes ofjournalists. I’ve found JohnBurn-Murdoch of the FT to be really excellent and to have taken quite a sensible, statistics-driven approach to everything. Rather refreshing among the bluff and bluster. I’m not on Facebook (left in 2016) nor Instagramso I have no idea what the news provision is there. Shopping and Food There was a period in mid-March where getting everything we wanted or needed was hard from the shops. My wife has been doing a once a week shopping trip to our local medium-sized supermarket, an M&S, or occasionally she goes to the smaller Coop nearby. Most of our shopping is now done online; we’ve used the EthicalSuperstore, Milk and More, and a new company called Fresh Connect to get things delivered to our door instead. Getting supermarket deliveries is impossible and my father as a 75-year old diabetic has only managed to get a delivery slot in mid-May from Waitrose as they recognise him as being on the government’s vulnerable list; other supermarkets say he is not. He had loads of food stashed away anyway as he had prepared for a no deal Brexit, so he has been fine through this crisis so far. I am relieved that he finally managed to get shopping delivered though as I’ve been a bit worried about him stillgoing to his local shops. The Fresh Connect deliveries are super; they were a wholesale supplier to restaurants and cafes in London and when that business disappeared in March they rapidly reorganised to supply homes across South London and Surrey. Their food is really good quality, they have everything we would like (even bread flour and yeast!) and the deliveries always arrive on time with everything there; they are a bit expensive but that does not really mater. Our eating habits have not changed really as we can get most of the food we like. I suspect we might be drinking a bit more, but not much more. We try to not drink Monday to Thursday, but I think we fail at that goal sometimes. Our cooking habits have changed a bit; generally, I did all the cooking as my wife worked in London so was commuting home in the evenings. Now she is at home she is doing more of the cooking, so we now share it 50/50. Entertainment and Leisure For leisure I have mainly been reading quite a bit. I read a few Agatha Christie Poirot novels, plus I started The Good Soldier Svejk but have only managed 1/3 ofit. I’ve also read a Barry Cunliffe book about prehistoric and ancient Europe as well as two books by Peter Hennessy (on 1945-51and the early1960s) both ofwhich were stunning. I’ve also watched quite a few films to try to escape from the moment, revisiting James Bond films for some reason, I expect they are so removed from reality that they allow my mind to forget the awfulness of the current crisis. We also watched Mallory Towers on the BBC iplayer, which was really good escapist kids fare; I started watching Killing Eve, which was excellent although my wife found it too violent (it is very violent, but also darkly comic). We watched some old DVDs as well of Only Fools and Horses (very funny although some of the early 1980s humour is quite racist) and a David Attenborough series about Africa. I also did a Future Learn online course about the history of the RAF in the Cold War (my wife says this is not relaxation and too close to my work). I found it really fascinating and although some of the online videos were a bit clunky there were still lots of genuinely fascinating insights, especially interviews with veterans and experts from things like the Air Historical Branch or the RAF Museum. I think I might do another one on Tudor England. Personal Hygiene I have been trying to follow the government guidance on washing my hands more often and for 20 seconds, especially when I went back to work in early May for the first meeting with some colleagues since this all started. The result of all this hand washing is that the skin on my knuckles and joints has got very cracked and often bleeds. It generally recovers every 5 days or so, and then gets worse again resulting in me leaving a trail of blood over towels and books. My hands look likeI’ve been bare-knuckle fighting. Sleep I have not really had a decent night of sleep since summer 2014, when my mother was diagnosed with cancer and died soon after. The current crisis has only made my insomnia worse, especially the stresses of work. A number of nights I have just been lying awake for hours writing and rewriting emails and planning documents in my head. Generally, I just get up and write the things whatever time it is, that sometimes helps. I also find reading helps clear my head, depending on the book. I think the insomnia adds to the sense of being knackered all the time produced by the heavy workload. Before all this started I used to take long walks to try to help me sleep, but that hasn’t been possible during the lockdown. Maybe things will get a bit better in the summer as teaching sort of resumes at work and that helps tire me out. I don’t think staring at acomputer screen allday helps very much either, and I find I sleep abit better when I’ve had adayof reading physical things or using the computer relatively little. Unfortunately, the current situation necessitates lots of staring at screens."

I believe that if you are unhappy, not just having a bad day, but in your normal disposition, or experience a prolonged episode of unhappiness, it can be detrimental to your overall health. I speak from experience; having had a bad relationship and a job I began to dread. My sleep was interrupted, I developed IBS, my feelings of self-worth plummeted, I was an emotional wreck in an otherwise fit and healthy body. It can be difficult to stay positive all the time but if you find what works for you (for me it is walking, being in nature, cycling and creativity), you should set aside time to do that, and see it as just as important as healthy eating or exercise. Next would be ‘active’. Regardless of your capabilities, I feel it so important to keep moving, walking, running, stretching, yoga, taking the dog out, dancing, cycling, doing the housework. Whatever you can manage within your own limits, just do it, get out there, sweat a little, push yourself even. Rather than thinking of fitness being ‘exercise’ which makes it feel like you should be doing some kind of sport or class, thinking of it as movement or mobility is a better approach. This will also help with maintaining the first word. ‘Fed’, to be well fed -as in a having good diet -is also important. I am a coeliac and cannot eat gluten. Diagnosed at an early age, I have always been aware of reading ingredients, checking what is in my food. I can’t eat a lot of junk or convenience food, so I learned to cook and prepare my own food at a young age. I was vegetarian for 15 years until I decided to introduce fish into my diet for health reasons. I grew vegetables organically in my garden allotment for many years, knowing the provenance of my food has become more important as I grow older. During the pandemic I have prepared pretty much every meal I eat myself, and although I was making most of them before anyway, this has increased the satisfaction of eating a lovingly prepared meal, made to my exact taste with fresh ingredients. Now in my middle age, I fully appreciate the benefits of being ‘Rested’. Having a good night’s sleep can be harder to achieve as you age. I have suffered from interrupted sleep on and off throughout my life. I wasn’t a good sleeper as a youngster and had bouts of insomnia at college. If I’m worried, I will have a bad night, either I can’t go to sleep or I wake up and toss and turn. Developing tinnitus at 18 caused huge problems, I listened to low level music to help me drift off for many years. I truly believe you should listen to your body, when you feel tired or run down, plan an early night. I have recently started to get up earlier in the morning to go for a walk before work (in winter I feel I don’t get enough time outside in the daylight as I work in an office) and I think this has a triple benefit, more exercise, helps with my feeling of wellbeing and makes me ‘good tired’ (as in physically tired through being active, rather than drained which is ‘bad tired’) at the end of the day which can aid sleep. When people think of the word ‘spiritual’ or ‘spirituality’ I imagine they would connect it to religion at one end of the scale and ‘hippy nonsense’ at the other. To be honest, both are fine with me and everything in between. I am not religious, but I come alive in nature. I connect. It makes my spirit soar to see a buzzard circling above me on a walk, to see the majestic colours of a sunrise. I do an hour of yoga once a week followed by a relaxation where I have regularly had an almost ‘out of body experience’. I feel calm and restored afterwards. I embrace all these opportunities to tune into F7368 myself, my spiritual side. Maybe some people wouldn’t equate this to being healthy but, to me, it completes the circle to be healthy in mind, body and spirit. Growing up my mum was always trying the latest health fad or diet. From the vibrating belt in the 1970’s to red and green days diets in the 1990’s, she spent decades (and no small fortune) on contraptions and subscriptions, none of which were successful. There was always some unused contraption gathering dust in their bedroom, that had promised to work miracles on your abs, bum or tum, but never delivered as she simply didn’t have the commitment. I don’t remember her as being particularly overweight as a child but in my teens, and her forties, she ballooned. At her heaviest she was wearing size 22 clothes. Eventually she was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and after medication had helped right her metabolism, she lost the weight steadily over four years and never regained it. Prior to this, it was the search for the quick fix. She had always been ‘big’ since childhood, in her opinion, and I think this had an effect on her mental health over the years. A constant struggle with her weight and unhappiness with her appearance made her prone to periods of depression and anxiety that culminated in a hospital admission. She simply stopped eating and wouldn’t get out of bed. My Dad was, and still is at almost eighty, a very active person. He was a television engineer by trade, and he would also do repairs at home in the loft conversion of our bungalow, carrying huge tube television sets up the extendable ladders. Eventually working for himself, he was putting in fourteen-hour days, every day. He did a bit of cycling, was involved with a local scout group and helped the work parties at their camp, building huts, chopping down trees. He never stopped, and although he has had two major heart surgeries in his fifties, then seventies, he is still out every day, chopping wood for his wood burner, building cabinets, shelves, little projects for friends and families, painting, decorating, he is an accomplished clay pigeon shooter, hefting a shotgun up, taking the kickback in his shoulder. I am in awe of him. As a family, we were never very active together. My mum taught me to swim from a very young age and I remember she took me to the swimming baths every Sunday morning up to around the age of seven nor eight. The mismatch of my parent’s interests and my Dad’s work meant we spent very little time together. I would holiday with my Mum in a family friend’s caravan while my Dad carried on working, we simply couldn’t afford him not to be working. We would walk our dog along the beach, and I would swim in the freezing brown water. Occasionally we would go for a day out, I called it the family fall out as we all irritated each other in close quarters of the car, but it would rarely involve anything physical, more a visit to somewhere, a look round the shops, a cafe stop. They once decided, on a whim, to visit a local nature reserve on the way home from a family get together and there was a warden doing guided trips. I was dressed in a bright yellow jacket, not having been prepared for the impromptu bird watching and the look of disbelief in my attire that the warden gave me has never left me. At school, health was called sport. It was called swimming (which I was ok at) and badminton, running, gymnastics, hockey, netball, rounders, and all the others you can think of (which I was not). As a girl it was never football, cricket our rugby. I decided at an early age that it was just not for me. If you didn’t excel at any of the above, you were discounted. No other alternatives offered. Picked last for everything, laughed at. When we did the occasional cross country running through the local park, I would call at home and have a brew with my mum as we lived close to the school, tag on at the back as they looped back past the house. I hated sport. We had home economics where we learned how to make a pineapple upside down cake and biology where we learned embarrassing things about our bodies. None of these were ever connected together. Wellbeing hadn’t been invented then. Puberty was an awful time. There seemed to be huge importance put on starting your periods as early as possible (I was late at 14). I never had much of a bust. I was uncomfortable in my skin, I had puppy fat and the memory of all those redundant exercise contraptions. I needed to be thinner, prettier, with big breasts, have long blonde hair, taller, sportier. I was none of these. It wasn’t until I was around 15 and met some different people, who listened to different music and F7368 wore goth style clothes and make up that I began to be happy with my appearance. I died my hair black, wore black eyeliner, boots and fishnet tights. I stopped caring what my peers at school thought. I had my own identity. I didn’t need to conform. When I left home and started work, I started swimming again. I think I had always enjoyed being in the water, but I also began to feel the buzz of pushing myself physically. I swam for an hour; I swam a mile. Later I would try running but this didn’t suit me, I kept getting little injuries. I joined a gym and started doing classes, mainly spin class but also pilates, yoga and some circuits. I never considered myself a ‘gym goer’ but until the closure of gyms last year I has been a member for over 15 years. I did enjoy the convenience of a led class, over quickly, done and dusted straight after work. I would get home and feel energized and tired in equal measures. Then, in my early thirties, I got a bike. This has to be the defining moment in realizing that exercise (sport even) is for me. I felt at one with my bike. I got a better one, a mountain bike and would go riding up in the local moorland. With my husband, who had been a keen cyclist for years (I had resisted), we went to trail centres, to the lakes, wooded cloughs and rode. We rode some of the Pennine trail in mid-winter, nearly breaking ourselves, we went to Majorca with our road bikes, we went to France and followed stages of Le Tour. I had found my perfect exercise, my happy place. Fitness and wellbeing followed but it was for the pure joy of riding that I did it. The good outcomes were a bonus. Now, in my late forties I still ride, but I do a lot more walking. We live on a narrowboat so there is always a ready-made walk straight from the door. This year I have started to walk in the morning before work for half an hour. Getting up in the dark and walking back to the sunrise helps both physically and mentally. I also walk most lunchtimes, do an hour of yoga once a week and try to get out on my bike at weekends in the winter. In the summer I ride two or three times a week. I am probably more aware of my body now but in a different way. I don’t aim for thin, I want to be strong, supple, active. Living on a boat means physical work, pushing a wheelbarrow full of shopping down the towpath, pulling on ropes, working the locks. It my aim to be able to do these for as long as possible. Like most people, I access the internet to research about health and nutrition but in all honesty, I don’t really do very much of this. I know enough about a healthy diet from past experience and I don’t overly concern myself with new trends or fads. I know what I enjoy, what I should do in moderation. I drink but try to be sensible, I no longer smoke having given up in my early thirties. I don’t eat meat, only fish. I prepare most of my own food from scratch, sharing recipe ideas with a colleague at work who shares the same interests in healthy eating. I am physically active every day. I don’t have any beauty regimes as such, I don’t wear make up. I developed exercise induced asthma (probably as a result of smoking) when I had a brief go at running and so I always have my inhaler with me (thankfully I don’t have to use it very often). I don’t do much with my hair (super curly). I think I’m pretty low maintenance. Apart from a bit of moisturizer, I do very little to prepare myself before I leave the house. My mum would always pop a bit of eyeshadow on before going out but she was never really one for getting ‘dolled up’. I’m not sure of my Dad ever looked in the mirror much! Regardless of their faults, my parents never put much importance on what you looked like. This was not where a person’s value came from. I have, from time to time, fallen victim to thinking I should look a certain way, and as I age, I see my face change, my skin crease and line, my body become less firm. But I have managed to stay happy and healthy though a mixture of exercise, diet and not worrying too much about what other people think."

Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Luckily neither I nor anyone I live with have experienced any physical or mental health issues during lockdown. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. We haven’t required any medical or professional help. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? At the start of lockdown I experienced periods of being scared – contemplating the possibility that I might die from coronavirus and the impact of this on my young son, or that my parents might die without family with them during their last moments. This has receded somewhat as lockdown has gone on. I haven’t felt particularly emotional – more preoccupied by everyday routines, by trying to juggle childcare and work, by trying to support my partner who has experienced lockdown as more frustrating and restrictive than I have. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? When I think about the political decisions that have been made I feel compassion for the politicians involved, as I think they are in an impossible and unprecedented position. I wonder if ambitious men like Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock envisaged the level of responsibility in a time of national crisis that is now placed on them; and whether they feel comfortable with this responsibility, or whether part of them wishes they had chosen a different path. I’m not a supporter of the Conservative party, and many of my friends are very critical of the decisions that have been made in relation to the pandemic, as are certain experts who have explained in the newspaper why they feel that the wrong decisions are being made. I’ve largely avoided these debates, as I think the whole subject is so complex and I am reluctant to wade in in an ill-informed fashion. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I anticipate that they will look to relax certain aspects of lockdown, but that lockdown may have to be reimposed if the virus resurges. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Pretty much exclusively via The Guardian website. I’ve tried to limit my news intake as I don’t feel that it’s beneficial to my mental health to be continuously exposed to news about such a traumatic and worrying subject. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I’ve deliberately avoided watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm – again in an effort to protect and promote my own mental health by not getting too caught up in news about the pandemic on a daily basis.  I’ve even chosen not to watch the most important announcements by the Prime Minister (for example on the imposition of lockdown), instead reading the details at a time of my choosing. Writing this, I wonder whether this represents a small attempt on my part to exert control in a situation where I have very little …. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Neither I nor anyone I know has experienced challenges with access to the news. I hadn’t thought about access to the briefings for deaf people but if the deaf community feels that BSL interpretation would be helpful to them then I would support this. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Both I and my partner continue to work and have been directed by our employers to work from home. Prior to the lockdown my work base was at home anyway, but I would spend a large proportion of my working week travelling to visit student social workers on their placements, and all such visits have now been cancelled. My partner did not work from home previously but travelled to his office in the centre of Leeds. BecauseIwasusedtoworkingfromhomeanyway,Ihaven’tfoundthetransitiontoodifficult,andhave positively enjoyed travelling less than I was used to. My partner anticipated that he would find it difficult, as he liked having a clear boundary between work (in the office) and home life (at home); however once he got access to a work laptop I think he has found it easier than anticipated. The main challenge is how to juggle work and childcare for our son, as his nursery is closed. We are both part-time so on a Monday and Tuesday I don’t work and on a Friday my partner doesn’t work, which means those days are largely fine. However on a Wednesday and Thursday we are both supposed to be working and of course our son still needs care. Those days are definitely more stressful and we have worked out strategies to make them as easy as possible (don’t try and do too many other households tasks like laundry; plan easy meal options). To start with it felt manageable as my work was relatively quiet – so although my partner’s work was busier, I could do the majority of the childcare but by the end of the day we would both feel like we had achieved what we needed to achieve. However over the last couple of weeks I have had lots of meetings in the diary so the balance has shifted so he has had to look after our son more, which has caused him stress when he feels that he is getting behind on work. That said – we are both aware that we are immensely lucky to still be employed, to be able to work safely at home, and to have sympathetic employers who understand the challenges of balancing work and childcare (both of our immediate bosses are doing the same thing). And there is lots of joy in being around the whole time to see our son develop and to have lots more playtime! How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Luckily for me my relationship with my partner has been a source of strength and support during lockdown, and I believe that he would say the same. I think we have both been considerate of each other’s needs; supportive at times when the other person is feeling stressed or anxious; and appreciative of everything that the other person does to contribute to a happy home life. There has been the odd occasion when we have been a bit snappy with each other but I think that’s probably more linked to tiredness if we’ve been up early with our energetic one-year-old rather than lockdown. I feel like I’ve learned a lot about my partner’s work life as I’ve seen him doing his job in a way that I never would normally be able to do –andIfeellikeI’velearnedabitmoreabouthimtoo. Forexample, something that has been really important to him during lockdown is cooking and eating something nice for each meal. This was the case when our son was newborn too, and I remember at the time finding this completely baffling – surely when you’ve just had a baby, or when you’re living through a pandemic, that’s the time to resort to frozen pizzas and takeaway?! But I’ve understood in this period that making sure that we eat something nice at each meal helps him feel in control in a scary situation; helps him feel like he is doing something useful for our family; and provides a regular source of sensory pleasure in a time when that might be scarce. Interestingly though we have both reacted differently to lockdown in some ways. Prior to lockdown we would often travel at weekends – either to see friends and family or to visit new places. My partner is really missing that, and can’t wait to be free again.  He feels like spending so much time at home is just a waste when there’s a whole world to explore and so many people we love to spend time with. WhileIamofcoursemissingfriendsandfamily,I’mequallyenjoyingthesimplicityoflifeatthemoment – where there’s no packing, travelling or scheduling a social calendar to do, and the most crucial decision is what to have for each meal and which route to take for our daily exercise. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I have been using Microsoft Teams and Zoom several times a day at work, neither of which I had ever used previously. I find them easy enough to use and don’t have any particularly strong feelings about using them – it’s nice to see people’s faces when you’re talking to them (as opposed to a phone call), and I’ve been surprised by the ease with which we’ve been able to convert most work activities into this format. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Since the pandemic I call my parents every day using Skype video chat for a quick catch-up and so they can see their grandson. This has grown to be a really nice part of the daily routine – they have enjoyed seeing my son get better at standing and eventually take his first wobbly steps, and have also read stories to him on the video chat. My partner has also taught his mum how to use WhatsApp video chat for the same reason, so she can see our son regularly even though she can’t see him in real life at the moment. My partner joins in with two weekly quiz meet-ups online with different groups of friends, and we’ve both been more active in calling our friends using video chat than would normally be the case – although of course in normal times we would be seeing them rather than calling them. Often these calls are really lovely and the pandemic has provided me with the time to re-connect with a couple of old friends who I have not been in touch with for a little while.  Equally on occasion I have got a bit overwhelmed with a packed schedule of phone calls and needed to plan in a few quiet evenings with no phone calls – particularly as there are a couple of more vulnerable people in my life who I’m trying to call more regularly. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? No – I don’t use social media and have even less desire than usual to do so during the pandemic. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? I am not currently grocery shopping as I have asthma and so social distancing as strictly as I can manage.  My partner only shops for essentials at our local garage shop.  My partner’s brother does a big shop for us all once a week, and some friends check in with us whenever they go shopping and drop off any extra bits we need To start with there were some shortages – particularly items for our baby son. Friends and family helped – my partner’s mother sent us a care package of Calpol and nappies from Norwich! We ended up transitioning my son from formula milk onto cow’s milk a couple of weeks earlier than his first birthday (which is what is recommended by the NHS) as we couldn’t easily find the brand of formula that he uses. While in some ways it’s lovely not to have to do the shopping – particularly now that it takes a long time due to social distancing -it is a little bit frustrating not be in control of the food in the house. For example last week my partner’s brother didn’t go shopping on his usual day, leaving us a bit unsure when he was going to arrive with food and so we struggled to plan meals. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Largely the same, although as I have described above I think it’s even more important to my partner to cook something nice for each meal. We have baked more and therefore eaten more cake, and we have also drunk more alcohol than we usually would. I think in the absence of other pleasures, food has become even more important and something to look forward to in our days – whether that’s a glass of wine with dinner or our regular mid-morning coffee. My partner has been ordering lots of cooking kits from a company called The Spicery that we have used previously, so we have been eating curries from around the world. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? With a one-year-old to look after and both still in employment, we have felt like we haven’t had much time to take up new hobbies. We have however been doing ‘Yoga with Adriene’ on YouTube some evenings together, which I have enjoyed as a means of decompressing from the day and relaxing. We both religiously take our daily exercise, which is either a walk or a run (often with our son in his running buggy), and really enjoy this. We play board games together sometimes, and also watch TV together in the evenings. At weekends we have done a few jobs that have been on the to-do list for a while – sorting out various cupboards and drawers and doing as much decluttering as we can. There is a large pile of books, clothes etc waiting to go to the charity shop after lockdown. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. On my own I am watching ‘The Tiger King’ and season 3 of ‘The Crown’ on Netflix. I’d like to watch the BBC dramatisation of the Sally Rooney novel ‘Normal People’ and also season 3 of the BBC series ‘The A Word’ but I think four series on the go at once might be a bit much, so I’ll probably tackle those once I’ve finished at least one of the ones I’m currently watching. I only tend to watch these when my partner’s not around or otherwise occupied – and of course at the moment these occasions are rarer than would be the case outside of lockdown – so I’m getting through them at a pretty glacial pace. With my partner I am watching ‘Bojack Horseman’ on Netflix and re-watching the BBC dramatisation of the Hilary Mantel novel ‘Wolf Hall’. I’ve just finished re-reading ‘Wolf Hall’ as well – I want to read the new Hilary Mantel novel ‘The Mirror and the Light’ but decided to re-read the first two novels in the Thomas Cromwell trilogy first, as it’s been years since I read them. I absolutely loved re-reading ‘Wolf Hall’, I’d totally forgotten how beautiful Hilary Mantel’s writing is. I’m going to read something else before moving onto ‘Bring Up The Bodies’ – haven’t decided which one yet, I have a pile of unread books (most of which were bought in a fit of enthusiasm at a friend’s charity second-hand book sale) so will pick out something from that. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My habits of personal hygiene haven’t changed at all in lockdown. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? In the first couple of weeks of lockdown there were a couple of occasions where I struggled to sleep due to worrying about the coronavirus – this has disappeared of its own accord though, and I haven’t needed to do anything to relieve this. Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Both my partner and I have had dreams about transgressing the lockdown – either where we have realised that we are breaking the rules, or we have noticed others doing so."

SPRING DIRECTIVE 2020 Part 2: COVID19 (Update) I am not sure if this is separate to the diary writing I am doing while in lockdown, so will just answer the questions anyway! Health: We have been self-isolating for 12 weeks now due to my husband’s heart problems. We have had no additional health issues, though we have found collecting his regular prescription quite stressful…especially at the beginning. The first time we had to do it we came home physically shaking. Emotionally we have been very stable, but we are aware that we are in a very comfortable position. We don’t have to worry about losing our jobs or to be afraid that we can’t eat or pay the mortgage. Obviously our three daughters are having to engage with the world far more than we do and we do worry for them. One son-in-law has been furloughed and another reduced to a 4 day week with the resulting pay cut. One daughter is a midwife, so our concern (and anger on her behalf) has been great, especially with regard to the lack of PPE.  Even though sanctions are beginning to be lifted, she has said that she will not risk visiting us, even at a social distance outside, due to the risk that she might be carrying it. Our eldest daughter who lives alone in London had the virus very early on and that was an awful time. Fortunately, she had it very mildly and recovered quite quickly and we are very aware that we are so lucky in that regard. The government: I find it very difficult to be supportive of this government and the way they have handled the crisis. The Prime Minister seems to react rather than to plan, make promises he can’t keep (tracking, testing, return of Primary schools). He gives the impression of not knowing what he is doing at any given time. It is impossible to predict what the government will do in the coming weeks because I don’t think they know. Since the Stay Home imperative, the messages they give out are unclear and easily misunderstood. News: I read the headlines in The Guardian online each morning. One side effect of the pandemic is that after the first few weeks I couldn’t concentrate long enough to read an entire article. Similarly, I started watching the daily broadcasts but quickly found I couldn’t bear to watch them all floundering around trying to justify what they were/weren’t doing. Neither we nor anyone we know has struggled to access the news. An excellent idea to include BSL interpreters… Work and home life: Our home life has adapted well to the changes. Although isolating, we have managed to walk every other day and to use our cross trainer on the days in between. We have enjoyed cooking more adventurously together; we have gardened, caught up with our to read lists and with film/TV series we wanted to watch or re watch. I think the exceptionally good weather has helped enormously. As has the fact that we haven’t had to struggle with home schooling or trying to fit in work. Our days have been full…and we are very thankful. S6840, female, 60 yrs, married, from Hinckley Leicestershire, retired SEN Teaching Assistant Technology: We are familiar with Facebook and have used it to keep in contact with our close family. Ditto email but we had to learn Zoom which we have used for Sunday church services and occasional sessions with our daughters. What we have noticed is a decline in the number of messages we are receiving from friends…at the beginning friends were messaging each other a lot more. Now we have to make more of an effort to stay connected and in fact have found we quite like the solitude. Shopping and food: We have shopped online (a first for us) since the beginning of lockdown. To our great surprise, it has been excellent. Right at the start we had a long gap between our first and second shop and then we found it hard to get a delivery slot so for 2 or 3 weeks we sat up to midnight in order to grab a new slot as soon as the next lot were released. Since then we have had no trouble booking a weekly slot. We also signed up to a weekly vegetable box scheme which gave us lots of incentive to cook slightly different meals based around vegetables. However, we now find we can get everything we need online so we have just cancelled it so that we can be in control of the vegetables (and the amounts) that we buy. Entertainment and Leisure: We have done lots of jobs, including decorating, waxing the wooden floor, major cleaning of cupboards, kitchen etc. Walking locally across the fields and near the canal, reading (Letters and Diaries of Virginia Woolf, The Myth of the Goddess by Anne Baring and Jules Cashford), films and old TV series (Line of Duty, Normal People) , exercising on the cross trainer, gardening. I also knitted for the first time in about 30 years…little hats for premature babies. I have now graduated to an elephant toy for my granddaughter. Personal hygiene: As we are just the two of us, I don’t think this has impinged on our lives as much as it would have done if we had the family at home. Our showering/ bathing/ shaving habits have stayed the same but we do wash our hands a lot more…after handling post or other deliveries, after walking etc. And we wipe down door handles and kitchen surfaces more often. We also change hand towels and tea towels daily rather than weekly. It is a nuisance, but something which I think will be a part of our lives for a long time to come. Sleep: On the whole we have slept really well. We have noticed that we are getting up much later and lingering over breakfast before getting dressed and starting our day. I have had one interesting dream whereby I was in an interview very similar to the one I had to gain entry to university back in 1977. Back then I floundered and didn’t feel confident. In this dream I was the opposite, enthusing and exciting the person who was interviewing me (we were discussing a book) I remember thinking, “I can do this!”"

We are usually pretty active, and so the lockdown rules regarding exercise outside of the home were hard to swallow. That said, our physical health has not suffered too much. We have walked, plus have a skipping rope and a mini step machine at home. We have not required any medical or professional help during this period. Our emotions have been up and down. It is hard not being able to see family, especially since my father recently had CV19 (recovered, thankfully) – I just wanted to be with my mother. Most of the time, emotionally, it’s ok. It’s only when we really start to think about what a crazy situation we’re in it becomes harder to manage. Neither of us have had panic attacks, but we have found it both stressful & hysterical, on and off. Difficult to describe. The Government I am in utter despair. I don’t believe they have made one good timely decision, and I absolutely distrust everything they say. I believe that they will re-open the economy too soon – relax the lockdown rules, I mean. I think we will see further cases. News I have tried not to look at the news too much – see ‘despair’, above. I look at The Guardian online, and Twitter, to get a general gist. We have not been watching the daily 5pm briefings. Mainly because it doesn’t suit us to, and also I don’t want to because I can’t believe a word that anyone at one of those podiums says, and I find their answers to be non-answers and it makes me frustrated and cross. I don’t know anyone who struggles to access the news. I think it is a good idea to be more inclusive, and I fully support the presence of a BSL interpreter. Work & Home Life I was furloughed during April. I was brought back to work (from home) at the beginning of May. Being furloughed was tough – my wife has been too, but she will be going back to work from next Monday 18th – but I managed to create a new routine – some exercise, we did some jigsaw puzzles, reading, writing. Even gardening. We usually take our walk in the evenings, which is a nice end to the day. Working from home is ok. I have a good set-up and I am in contact with my team and other colleagues via Teams daily. There are no children in the house. I couldn’t imagine having that additional pressure. My wife and I are enjoying spending so much time together and have generally found much to laugh about. We have shared ‘socially-distanced’ drinks with our neighbours over the back fence. The sunshine during April helped a lot. Technology We had already been using Teams at work, but it has been a really useful tool for keeping in touch with my colleagues – both in my immediate team and throughout the company. I use Teams to chat with a small group of friends every fortnight or so – this has been initiated since the lockdown. Wife & I also use Teams to talk to her siblings every week or so. I was using WhatsApp anyway, but now have been using it for video calls a bit more – mainly to the same group of people that I message; it is nice to see faces. I have just started using Zoom. My mum likes it because she can use her laptop and see us on a big screen, rather than on her phone (smaller) via WhatsApp. I am only using Zoom with my family. I have not reconnected with anybody. I am in touch with the people I want to be in touch with, and I don’t feel obliged to reach out. I dislike Facebook, and my use of it has not changed. Ditto Twitter, although I use it now to escape from everything as well as to see the news. There are some funny things on Twitter. Shopping & Food I have driven to Big Sainsbury’s once every fortnight since lockdown began. At first it was very strange – dystopian – and there wasn’t much available. My third trip was yesterday, and it seems much more ‘new normal’ although there are still some items in short supply. I have not had any trouble finding what I need, however, and even if there was I could do without or find alternatives. The bigger supermarket is a weird experience. I haven’t enjoyed it much. One feels almost criminal. I have glanced at online shopping, but there are no slots. During the week we top up our shopping – milk, fresh fruit & veg – at the little Tesco Express down the road. I go early in the morning (0620hrs or so) when it is quiet. We have been planning our meals more, and also using food we have – tinned food and food from the freezer. Our habits have generally stayed the same. Entertainment & Leisure I have been blogging – I started a blog at the beginning of my furlough leave. And I have been continuing to learn French (using Duolingo), which I had already been doing since the start of the year. I have done some alternative exercising – I am used to going for runs, or taking more walks – so I now do skipping in the morning, and some steps on the step machine at lunchtime. We have been doing more gardening – wife painted the shed, and we trimmed the bushes in the front garden. Our DIY skills are limited… We both read a lot – I am reading a wine book, currently, alongside Elton John’s autobiography. Wife is reading some fiction alongside Cathy Newman’s Bloody Brilliant Women. I have been listening to Jameela Jamil’s podcast, I Weigh. Wife has got audible. We listen to books together (The Secret Barrister’s book at the moment) and she has her own books she listens to as well. When it all gets too much, we watch some silly movies. We watched all three Pitch Perfect movies recently, and Finding Dory as well. On Netflix we watched Wanderlust, Dr Foster, and currently, After Life. We have got Pose on the go, and a few other things that we dip in and out of. We have a lot of Poirot recorded off the telly. They are terrible but they do the trick, sometimes. For laughs, we watch Brooklyn 99. Personal Hygiene We both shower every morning, wash our hair when it needs washing, and get dressed in proper clothes. I still put on a little eye makeup because I think it makes me look a little less haggard. Neither of us have been wearing our bras. Why would we? As far as I can tell, our personal hygiene habits have not altered. Sleep I am a terribly sleeper anyway, so I don’t think my sleep has been any different. I don’t think my wife’s has either. We both have work-based anxiety that is different from CV19 anxiety – work stuff occasionally keeps my wife awake, but on the whole our sleep is no different. I rarely remember my dreams, sorry."

No. W3163 Age: 62. Occupation: Voluntary Worker. Location: St Gennys, Cornwall. Marital Status: Married Date: 4th August 2020 Subject: Covid 19 (Update) Health Neither of us have any physical or mental health issues other than creeping age and general decrepitude. In all honesty the current situation hasn’t been too onerous for us. We don’t really socialise a great deal in normal circumstances and as we are fortunate enough to have quite a bit of space, the lockdown and shielding hasn’t affected us as much as it might others in different circumstances. In view of that my emotions are just as they always are; sometimes more cheerful than others but generally positive. The Government In my view the Government is doing what it can to preserve the health of people whilst trying to help the economy. Money doesn’t grow on trees and there isn’t an endless supply. When people say ‘the Government should pay’ they forget that the Government only has money which people give it by way of taxes. So in fact everyone is paying – if people aren’t working and paying tax the money supply dries up. It’s a difficult problem and everyone becomes couch economists or scientific experts in how to deal with a pandemic. How the situation is dealt with in the coming months will depend entirely on what happens now and in the near future. News I get most of my information from the television, newspapers, texts I receive from the Government and information from the NHS. I watched some of the daily briefings to start with but soon stopped as all the information was repeated ad nauseam. I don’t know of anyone who has had a problem with getting access to news and I do think that adding BSL to the briefings would be beneficial to those who need it. Work and home life As I don’t work the lockdown hasn’t had any impact and furlough isn’t an issue either. Lockdown hasn’t had any adverse impact for me as I’m not one for mixing with too many people anyway. In fact it’s shown me just how antisocial I really am! I do miss going out for the occasional meal and drink with J, and I do miss swimming, I used to swim several times a week. The last time I went was 20th March and the pool still hasn’t re-opened and neither has a date been given when it will. Being in lockdown has had no adverse or otherwise effects on my domestic relationships; we get along just fine all the time as we always give each other plenty of space. Technology I do use a computer and social media but no more now than I usually do. I do not use Zoom, Facetime, etc. as I don’t have a webcam and have no plans to get one. Shopping and food For the first couple of months or so I did get my groceries online as I’m one of the chosen people to get the letter from the Government/NHS telling me to stay inside for 12 weeks. I always said I wouldn’t shop online for groceries but then found I had to. At first it was impossible to get a delivery but the Government made email addresses available to the stores and they soon were messaging me telling I could have a priority delivery slot. I also was getting free food parcels from the Government which I was quite uncomfortable about as I have enough food in my cupboards, freezers and garden to last for quite some time! I managed to find someone locally who was a carer for people in a worse situation than me and when these parcels came I’d call her and she would collect them and pass them to the people she cared for. This went on for about six weeks and every time I messaged through the Government website to say I didn’t need them but they still kept coming! The message finally did get through and they stopped. My cooking and eating habits have not changed other than not going out for the occasional meal. Entertainment and leisure The only thing that has changed in regards to this is that I cannot go swimming, other than that all is the same. I have three ponies to look after and without going into detail there is a lot of work involved with that. We have a large garden and grow a lot of vegetables as well as having part of the garden laid to lawn (I use that word loosely) with flower borders and about five acres for the ponies surrounded in part by hedges – this all needs to be cared for so there is never any shortage of things to do. Other than watching the news and things like Countryfile I also read. So far this year I’ve read 1000 Years of Annoying the French by Stephen Clarke, Between the Stops by Sandi Toksvig, Six Minutes in May (How Churchill unexpectedly became Prime Minister) by Nicholas Shakespeare, and The Secret Barrister. I’m now reading SPQR by Mary Beard and have also started The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel – that’s going to be a stretch I think as it’s nearly 900 pages long! I do listen to the radio but only when I’m cooking and it’s normally Radio 2. Personal hygiene I think the only thing that’s changed is that when I go shopping (once a week) I use hand sanitiser and wipe my trolley or hand basket with an antibacterial wipes which are now available in the supermarkets at the entrance, as well as using a face mask – even before it became law. When I get home I wash my hands with soap and water. Sleep Sleep patterns are unchanged for both of us."

I have a rowing machine, stationary bike and weights at home and use them five days a week in the morning. As I am no longer driving into work, I don’t have to get up as early in the morning to fit in my exercise routine before starting work. I know I’m less active than I would be if I was going to the office each day and I do miss the long flight of stairs I walked up to my office every day. I’ve bought an exercise trampoline for between-times like when I’m waiting for the kettle to boil for a cup of tea. Mentally I’m OK – but I think I’ll feel it more as restrictions are lifted. Yesterday I had tears in my eyes when I saw that the Baker was open again. A little bit of normality back. I’m just taking it day by day and dealing with it, but it will be such a relief when we’re at least over this a bit. The Government I think there have been some very difficult decisions made and that we won’t be able to assess what the impact has been for years to come. I think it was right to bring in the lockdown and relatively easy compared to deciding on an exit strategy. This is unprecedented and mistakes will be made and undoubtably have been. I think we’ve done on balance not badly, but not particularly well in comparison to other countries. I think there will be more of the gradual easing of restrictions, there will be more confusion and more frustration that there has been until now. When the message was clear – stay at home – protect the NHS – save lives everyone understood that. It was absolute. The latest message doesn’t really mean anything, it’s just an attempt at a follow-up catchphrase. I see there is already an increase in testing and talk of tracing. There may also soon be more things opening. News At the start I watched the daily updates from the government. That was when there were big announcements like closing pubs/restaurants and schools). Now I tend to read the summaries on the BBC website (unless it’s going to be a big announcement). I feel like the government broadcasts are a good thing to have, but I don’t need to see them every day. They also run a bit long. I’ve got a bit of covid news fatigue now. Sometimes in the morning I watch CNN just for a change from UK news. I have the BBC News app on my phone which sent me alerts when Boris Johnson and Prince Charles were found to be positive. I don’t’ have any challenges getting the news – between the TV, BBC and Guardian apps and the odd newspaper, I feel like I’m overwhelmed with news about Covid. I know it’s a worldwide crisis, but I’m tired of it. Work and home life At the start of lockdown I was working on a laptop on a folding table. My elbow started to be painful. I haven’t gone to the Doctor about it because of lockdown. At work I normally have a rising desk so I can sit or stand because I have a bad knee. I don’t have that at home. Once my arm started to bother me I went into work and brought home peripherals (keyboard/mouse/docking station) and bought a stand so that I could raise my laptop up to the correct monitor height above the plugin keyboard. I also started using an ironing board as a desk so that I could stand up. I bought a bar stool after making sure it was exactly the right height for me to use at my temporary ‘standing desk’. I should be getting a breakfast bar delivered tomorrow to replace my increasingly wobbly ironing board set up. Again, I measured to ensure it is exactly the right height and depth and that it will fit in the spare bedroom. While I’d love a sit/stand desk, all of the ones I’ve seen are way too big for the space I have. I have a member of staff with back problems – one of our senior managers didn’t think we’d need to bring anything but laptops home for the duration – I told my member of staff to take their specialist chair if they needed it. I can see all sorts of enduring neck, back and leg problems coming out of the lockdown. I’m surprised that I’m relatively happy working at home. I used to feel isolated when I did so, but as the whole team (of around 20 people) is doing so, we are finding ways to communicate. I also think when we do call each other, we always chat more than we need to purely for work. That helps to make up for the social interaction we are missing from when we sat in the same office. My cat keeps me company every day (sometimes sitting on the ironing board, or on me, or on the bed next to the ironing board). That’s something I will miss going back to the office (if I ever do) and I think that the cat will miss it too. I actually feel more anxious about returning to work right now than staying where I am. The talk is of 25% maximum back in office with rules about which way to walk down a corridor, stairs which are for walking one way only (one set up the other set down) washing of desks and social distancing. That’s a lot to be thinking about when you’ve got a busy job already. I’d rather stay home. I know some people are really missing being physically in the same space, especially those who live on their own, but for me the constant worry related to being in the workplace outweighs the advantages. Also, I’m saving lots of money and wear on the car by not having a daily commute. I’m getting uplater and even if I finishlater at night,I close the laptop and I’m done. No commute. Because I’msobusy with work, the majority of my day is spent in the same way it was before lockdown, if at a different location. I talk to the same people and deal with the same tasks. I think that has helped my mental health. Most of the day I can ignore the context. My husband has been off work with (work-related) stress for the whole of the lockdown so far but is going back to work soon. But he’s been busy in the garden and now he can go back to playing golf. I make a point of having time away from him. Also, my work day means I see him for the same amount of time I normally would in the evenings. The only difference is the occasional cup of tea I get delivered. I feel very lucky to be working and not to have children. While being furloughed sounds nice (money for nothing) I know that if I was in that position I would be far more anxious than I am now and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it. Technology We already have whatsapp groups at work and now at home we have a ‘pub’ group. Workwise we use skype constantly for phone meetings and group messaging. At work we now have an optional zoom meeting every Friday for drinks and quiz; it’s nice to be able to see each other. At home we’ve started zoom meetings for the pub group. None of us had used zoom before and it isn’t always smooth, but it is helpful. Shopping and food At the beginning of lockdown I was most upset when the restriction on buying UHT milk came in – one or two cartons a time. Before this we’d buy 12/24 cartons at the beginning of the month and then not have to think about buying milk again until the following month. That’s something that’s happened in my house growing up for as long as I can remember. At the start we then went to buying 4/6 pint containers from the local shop. I had no idea how quickly I went through milk (and it is mostly me rather than my husband). Now, even with the restriction lifted, it’s still something we go to the shop for. It’s a reason toleave the house and walk to the local shop and for me it’s a symbol of lockdown. Once I feel like things are normal enough we’ll go back to bulk-buying UHT. But until then it’s a walk to the shop ever other day or so for the fresh stuff. I don’t normally dothefoodshopping as I don’t dothe cooking, sosupermarkets are not somewhere I used to spend much time. Now I dread going in to Morrisons in case there is a queue, if not outside then for the tills. I don’t mind going to the smaller shops but it’s all a lot more effort than normal. Husband cooks the same things as before and I eat them. I have also made a conscious effort to stick with my normal work-day eating. Since getting a desk job nearly 20 years ago I have been conscious of not burning that many calories at work. It helps that I’m busy working because I tend to eat when I’m bored. Entertainment and leisure I’m still watching what I normally would to keep entertained. I’m not into sports so it hasn’t affected me too much. I do miss going to the cinema. I generally watch films/TV drama to get away from current events, but sometimes I do catch myself seeing things in films that wouldn’t happen now – crowded airports, eating out and it seems weird that it was so normal a few months ago and now it isn’t. We watched Contagion. I enjoyed the film and felt it was in some ways realistic, in some ways not (where was the panic-buying of loo-rolls?). As I’m not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan I was pleased her character was the first to die. We watched Outbreak too which was rubbish – bomb a town to deal with the disease? We’ve finally got round to watching Friday Night Dinner, which is hilarious. One show per night and we’re nearly caught up. At work we play along on our skype group message with Radio 2’s Popmaster nearly every day. I’d never heard of it before this. I have gone from reading a biography of Marie Antoinette to Penny Jordan Mills & Boon. I think I’m regressing and it’s my way of doing something utterly brainless. I haven’t read Mills & Boon for years and it really is utter trash, but I just can’t stop. But at least it’s not affecting my waistline, as eating trash food would. I wish I had the spare time to do all these things other people are doing at this time. I stand in my spare room day after day working all day, staring out the window. I have to walk past the things in my house that I want to do. I have no more time than I did before, I just have the constant awareness that other people have spare time. But then I remind myself I’m extremely lucky to have a job. In the interests of self-improvement I started watching a performance of Carmen while I do my exercise. Half and hour of opera a day while cycling/rowing is about all the extra enrichment I have time for. I like to crochet but I just don’t feel motivated at the moment. Personal Hygiene I still get up every morning, exercise and shower. I wash my hair twice a week, as per normal. What I haven’t done since lockdown started is use any heat on my hair to dry or straighten it. I also haven’t used any hairspray. Sometimes I put my hair up for zoom meetings but it doesn’t have to last or withstand the outside world so no hairspray needed. Makeup is only for zoom meetings, but I do enjoy making the effort. Normally my hairdresser dyes my hair with foils and I’ve just passed the first cancelled appointment. I will not ruin my hair with box dye (why? Who’s looking?) I will rest it until I can go to the hairdresser. I can’t remember the last time I wore my contact lenses (which I used to wear most week days). Glasses are less effort. Contacts are better for driving (especially at night) but when am I going to do that again? I’ve started putting nail hardener on my nails once a week. I feel like my nails and hair are in hibernation. I’mkeepingthem healthy until they can come out to play again. I wear jeans most days that are stretchy but not that stretchy – I bought a load of clothes for my (cancelled) holiday and want to be able to fit in them once this is over. I mostly wear sports tops (non-iron) at the moment. I feellikeI’min aholdingpattern –keeptheroutine, stay healthy, don’t let things slide. It’s almost like waiting for your wedding – look after yourself, watch what you eat, exercise, look after nails and hair then you get to show it off at the end – main difference being we don’t have a date for the Big Day yet. Sleep I have terrible insomnia anyway, so no real change there. But I am having more anxiety dreams. The night before I drove to work to get my desk kit, I had bad dreams – I think because I was worried I’d get stopped by the police. Things that were normal before have become sources of anxiety. My husband has been sticking to a routine of getting up and going to bed at normal times, as have I. I do get up later because I use my normal commute time to do my exercise and sometimes I struggle with motivation. I could get to work earlier but the nature of the work is, I’ll still end up working late. So might as well get there later. I don’t usually exercise in the morning on a Wednesday – I have a walk at lunchtime to my dad’s flat to pick up the post. He went into hospital in March, where he caught Covid-19 and his mobility deteriorated to a point where he won’t walk again, so he’s in acare home (temporary at the moment,but no way will he be able to come home). I guess I could redirect the mail, but it’s nice to have a reason to go for a walk and I don’t have to go inside the block as the post-boxes are outside. I sometimes use the Headspace app to try sleep meditation or for sleep soundscapes. I also use sleeping pills once a week to try and get at least one night’s good sleep – but this is the same as it was before the lockdown."

I have not suffered any detrimental effects on my health physical or mental during lock-down.  As I spend a lot of time on my own and as I am use to keeping myself occupied I have not felt the need to make large adjustments from my life style previous to lock-down.  If there has been any effect on my health from lock-down it is likely to be an improvement in my fitness. I have been going for more regular brisk walks, and I have been doing more work in the garden than usual.    If I go anywhere I usually walk briskly, but in recent years when I have been at home I have tended not to go out very often just for a walk.  If I am out for some other reason then I might have a walk and enjoy it. I had intended to try and go for more walks, even just short ones, and the lock-down has encouraged me to do so.  This time of the year I would be doing some work in the garden, but because I am not going out except for walks and shopping for food, I have more time to spend in the garden.  Usually I have had a holiday in May of about two weeks.  Not going on holiday has meant more time in the garden. My emotions over the last few week as have been relaxed.  I do not go out to work, I do not have any money worries, and I am use to being on my own, so I have not felt affected by the lock-down. I would rather spend time at home to protect my health.   I accepted lock-down as the sensible approach and decided to relax and wait until it is safer to take part in what is usually considered to be normal life. The Government I have not been impressed by the government’s actions.  I thought that the lock-down should have started earlier, and had decided to limit my movements before it began.  At least the initial lock-down recommendations were fairly clear, but when the lock-down was relaxed the message was confusing, and the recommendations seemed bizarre, as if they had been someone’s off the cuff idea which had not been examined.  The idea of being able to meet someone in public if a 2 metre distance apart was adhered to seemed odd.  This did not seem to different from what people had been doing except they had been doing it at one the people’s home, standing outside and maintaining the required separation.  The lifting of the travel restrictions so that people could drive to beauty spots seemed to me to be too great a change.  I felt it would have been better to limit people to remaining within regions centred on where they lived.  Not having any distance restrictions appears to have allowed people to go to places where they are not welcomed, but could lead to the spread of the virus in country areas which have had low incidences and are remote from NHS facilities.  There does seem to be a lack of understanding the consequences of the changes in lock-down. The government did not seem to able to address the effects of the corona virus on any institution over than hospitals.  The aim seemed to be to protect the NHS rather than people.  I suspect this was MO 3231 Male, 70 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) driven to some extent by the bad publicity which could occur if the NHS was seen to be near to collapse.  The effect on care homes of the virus does not seem to have been considered, or planned for. The Dominic Cummings affair seems to have shown that there are rules for the vast majority of people, which those in positions within the political establishment can ignore.  The fall out for the affair has been badly handled.  I think Dominic Cummings should have been sacked.  By not doing so the government has tacitly given permission to people to at least bend the rules, and at worse ignore them.  It does seem that he will still be a special adviser for some time. The latest changes in lock-down which come into affect in June do not seem well thought out.  I suspected that these could lead to a rise in corona cases, and I noticed that experts are saying the same.  There is a hurry about relaxing the restrictions which seems to be more concerned about the economy than people.  I would have though that a rise in cases, and maybe more restrictions would have a bigger effect on the economy in the long run. I do accept that these are difficult times for a government, and I do accept that some sensible decisions have been made.  The initial lock-down with its restrictions, such as working from home, reducing places were working was allowed, and reducing travel,  did appear to be necessary.  Trying to protect people’s jobs my the various financial schemes,  such as the furlough, were necessary.  If more people had lost their jobs that would have added to the stress they were undergoing. Technology My only change in the use of technology has been to hold Zoom conferences with my sisters and nieces.  These have been arranged by one of my nieces.  The rest of the time I have been keeping in touch with people by use of the telephone, though I have not been making any more phone calls than normally. I have found the Zoom conferences useful for seeing how the family members are getting on, and having a general chat with them.  I must admit I usually do not have much to say.  I have phoned my sisters and nieces directly to talk to them, though usually about topics that are not for a general family discussion, such as birthday presents. I have done shopping on line but I have been doing more since the lockdown. Shopping and Food The big change I have experienced is in shopping for food.  I had the habit of doing shopping at least once a week for food.  Often I would tie in these shopping trips with other outings, though usually for my major shops I would just visit a supermarket then home.  I now plan my shopping more before I go out, and I am shopping less frequently.  Instead of going shopping once a week I am now going roughly every nine days.  I am buying more when I do go to make sure I have enough food to last me.  I have restricted myself to going to one supermarket and I have made use of the period set aside for older people.  This has meant that I am doing my shopping earlier than I usually would, arriving at the supermarket about 8:30 rather than about 9:20.  Apart from shopping less frequently the items I purchase has not changed much.  Previously I would not wait until I ran out of some item, but get a replacement beforehand.  Now when I go MO 3231 Male, 70 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) shopping I do check if I am likely to run out of something in the next couple of weeks so I can add it to my shopping list.  One problem I have had with shopping for some time is loose tea.  I prefer loose tea but it is getting more difficult to get in supermarkets.  I have had tea delivered to my door my Ringtons, though the corona pandemic stopped those for a while. I did order tea on line and have it delivered by parcel from Ringtons. I had to wait a few days before I could order as the tea was not in stock.  The tea I get from Ringtons is my everyday drinking tea.  I do have speciality tea for an evening, for after my dinner.  That I have been ordering on line from Twining for some time.  Usually I have been able to get breakfast tea in supermarkets, but not recently. I ordered some on line, from another supplier. All my orders of tea have arrived before I ran out of a particular tea. When I ordered tea on line I tend to order quite a number of packets of tea.  As I am going to be paying for postage I try and reduce the cost of postage compared to the cost of tea.  On one order I bought an extra packet of tea as it would mean that I got free postage. I usually get razor blades from Boots. I use a Boots razor and their own make blades.  I realised I might be in danger of running out blades, so I ordered some on line.  I ordered plenty and they should last a good few months. I have ordered clothes on line before, usually shirts.  The lock-down lead to me looking at shirts and I ordered a couple.  When they arrived I was quite pleased with them and I ordered 3 more shirts and a pair of trousers from the same company. The corona pandemic has led to me to change one aspect of shopping on line.  I have bought items on line for birthday presents, had them delivered to me, wrapped them up, then either posted them on or delivered them in person.  For presents for one one my sisters I ordered them from Amazon, arranged for them to be delivered directly to my sister, and I paid for them to be gift wrapped.  I would not normally bother to pay extra for gift wrapping. Entertainment and Leisure On the whole I have not changed how I spend my time.  I have more time as I am not going out as frequently.  During the day usually I would be doing chores around the house and garden, reading articles from the magazines I subscribe to, using my PC to sort out photos I had taken, doing family history on my PC, and generally using my computers to keep me informed and to use as tools.  During the evening, after eating, I would listen to some classical music while attempting a cryptic crossword, then read books and/or watch TV, documentaries or programmes I had recorded, or films  from DVDs.  None of this has changed, apart from having more time to during the day.  I have read more than usual and I have spent more time in the garden than usual.  The latter partly because I have been at home more than usual, and partly because of the good weather.  I have sat outside in the sun and read more than I usually would have done. I have spent some time over the past weeks finding out about General Relativity.  It is a topic I did not study at university and I have always wanted to know more about it. I have made attempts in the past to try and learn about General Relativity but these have come to a halt because of being away, usually on holiday.  I realised that as I would not be going far for quite a while I would have the opportunity to try and understand it.  I had been working my way through a book on General Relativity quite slowly.  It is the mathematics that I have had to study slowly.  Now I have been through the book I am going to go through it again to see what I did and did not understand. MO 3231 Male, 70 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) My other reading has been books covering a variety of topics, including life in Nazi Germany, popular books on quantum physics and modern physics, a history book on some of the myths of Britain’s role in World War Two, and how powerful Britain and its Empire were, how the country developed and improved weapons, and how it was in a much stronger position than is usually thought.  Also I have read a biography of the film director Ernst Lubitsch, and a book on the Derbyshire County Championship side of the 1930s, and articles from this year’s Wisden Cricketers’Almanack.    For many years I have been recording what might be interesting documentaries onto a PVR, though I never seem to have found the time to watch all I record.  I have built up quite a collections going back many years.  Usually I manage to watch most of what I record but going on holidays did not stop me recording programmes.  This led to a backlog.  I have been watching some programmes I recorded years ago, including a series on American art, and a series on the Crusades.  I still have about 150 programmes I have recorded yet to watch, though these are not all documentaries. I have been watching old films, and quite a few film noir.  Some of these I have recorded and watched, but others I have on DVD.  I have plenty of films on DVD and have been watching a variety of old films, comedies, and dramas. Personal Hygiene My personal hygiene has not changed during lock-down, apart from washing my hands more.  I still either wash or shower in morning when I get up, followed by shaving.  I put on clean clothes as frequently as I use to do so before the lock-down. After I retired I continued with the same personal hygiene procedures that I had been use to when I was at work.  Going into lock-down did not seem to me to be any major change. My only change in personal hygiene has been that I wash my hands more frequently.  When I come in the house from being out shopping or after going for a walk I wash my hands.  When I have been to the supermarket I wash my hands when I come in, and again after putting my shopping away.  After I have received post or parcels and picked them up I wash my hands.  In the past I would not have washed my hands so frequently. Sleep There has not been any change in my sleep.  I am sleeping about the same amount as I usually do and getting the same quality of sleep as usual.   I have not been having any more dreams than usual, and I have not been suffering from nightmares. Other Effects It is certainly a strange time.  I have been feeling fairly relaxed about my situation. I have accepted that it is for the best that I keep myself fairly isolated from people for quite a while. I have the strange feeling that I have entered a period of timelessness.  I do not see any great change to my situation occurring in the near future, and have not done for some time.  In a way because there is no change of circumstances to look toward I have entertain a kind of limbo.  It is giving me a rather relaxed feeling, one of timelessness.  Usually at this time of year I would have returned MO 3231 Male, 70 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) from a holiday, and have had sorted out my washing from the holiday, and then caught up with the other chores, mainly gardening and shopping, which result from a period away from home. Also I would be thinking about my next holiday, or holidays, I usually go away in May, July, and September.  I would have probably arranged to see my sisters and nieces, and I would have arranged to see friends.  These events mark the passage of time, giving me an event in the future when I have to do something different.  These events are not occurring, so I no longer have events to mark the passage of time, hence the feeling of timelessness.  And it is quite a pleasant feeling."

Neither of us has had any health issues (9 weeks now) either physical or mental. We’ve been fine the whole time. As for emotions, I’ve felt sad that I can’t hug my daughter when she comes round with shopping for us. I’m extremely aware that we are lucky in having a large garden with lots of work to do in it which is good for our health. I have felt anxious about where it’s all going to lead and leave us – all of us. The Government I think the government has done too little too late throughout the pandemic. They made the decision not to buy PEP three times early on which is inexcusable and continue to be too easy going about it all I feel. What will they do in the coming months? Who knows. Make the wrong decisions probably, relaxing restrictions too soon, trying to blame others when things go wrong. I look at leaders such as the New Zealand prime minister and Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland and wish our leader was more like them. News My husband and I have totally different attitudes towards the news. I look at the BBC news website every morning to get the headlines and that’s enough for me. He watches every news – mid-day, 6pm, 10pm and then Newsnight (by which time I’ve gone to bed). I don’t think it helps to immerse yourself in it – it certainly wouldn’t help me, though he finds it vital. We haven’t watched the daily government briefings at all. I wonder how many people do? So much of what is in the TV news (which I watch the headlines of then go into another room while my husband watches the rest) seem to focus on what ifs and complaints against the authorities/government. I don’t see the point of that. Just deal with it and move forward. I don’t know anyone having problems with access. The Scottish parliament using BSL seems a good idea, though I know it’s possible to have subtitles on TV and I imagine people do use that. Work and home life As we are retired the lockdown has had far less impact on us than many others, and I suspect that people in our position will be the least affected. Our life has changed only in that we haven’t been shopping, but the main affect is that we would have been over at our house in France since March which of course hasn’t been possible. As we’re used to spending all our time together everything has been fine. Technology It would have been much more difficult to cope with the lockdown without the internet that’s for sure. A friend in the village set up a Zoom group early on for several of us to chat each morning at 11am with a coffee. This continues, mostly just with us and her and her husband, occasionally some of the other 4 couples join in. It’s been good having this contact, even though we all live within a few hundred yards of each other. I regularly Whats App with my daughter and have kept in touch a little more than usual via that and email with family in Cumbria. I’ve also emailed friends nearby and further afield a little more frequently than usual. I’m not a lover of the phone so rarely use that. I do use Facebook and Twitter but no more than usual – though this is several times a day. It feels good to be in touch with friends around the world, know they’re OK and share memories as well as current statuses. A friend who lives in Derbyshire invited us with another couple to a Zoom dinner party that was good fun. We chatted, had a break to eat, then came back together after each course. He had sent us a couple of quiz rounds to look at while we ate then we shared answers. It was also good to interact with new people – something that of course isn’t happening now. Shopping and food Prior to lockdown I had gradually stocked the pantry pretty well, including the things we would have been taking with us had we been able to go to France, so we were OK for some things from the start. We have been fortunate that we had just started to get Hello Fresh deliveries which provides the ingredients for three fresh meals each week that I cook. This has been fun – I don’t have to plan the meals and I’m learning new recipes. It works out at £5 per head per meal. The other good things are that because the local market has been closed, some of the market traders have been delivering, so we have had weekly deliveries of fruit and veg, milk, eggs, bread and butter; meat and fish (we alternate those). For other things my daughter has shopped for us once every 7-10 days which she brings over and we can chat in the garden at the appropriate distance of course! So we haven’t missed out on anything. Oh, and I’ve also bartered rhubarb from the garden for eggs from a friend up the road – we hang our respective bags on the gatepost for exchange when she passes. As things reopen gradually (the markets start next week) we plan to do click and collect from Sainsbury’s to avoid going into the shops. We haven’t been near any sort of shop for the past nine weeks. An interesting and unexpected bonus came via a friend in the village. Through contacts she gets a delivery each week from Waitrose of their unsold short shelf-life products (fruit and veg and sometimes bread). We pick up some of that from her driveway and help bag the rest for delivery to vulnerable people in the village. What’s left then goes to Mildenhall up the road for distribution to families there. For non-grocery items I have ordered a couple of thing s online which is not something I would normally do. I ordered seeds for the garden and a kettle when the old one broke! Oh, and I’ve just sent for some summer clothes as all mine are in France! That’s definitely a first! Entertainment and Leisure Because the weather has been mostly in our favour and we have a large garden that has been neglected for several years with us being in France most of the summer, we have spent a lot of time working outside. This has felt good on two counts – (a) to be outside and productively occupied and (b) because the garden is looking much better than it has for years. We’ve cleared several large overgrown areas and replanted them and have had the opportunity to consider plans for larger scale, longer-term projects like erecting fencing and a wooden garage. A couple of friends kindly donated plants they were clearing and we were able to get some delivered from a market garden in the village. There’s still plenty to do and we have a veg plot that’s coming on well. We have potatoes, onions, spinach, runner and French beans, carrots, leeks, tomatoes and courgettes. I had bought the seeds prior to lockdown and we got tomato plants from a stall in the village. We also have apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, strawberries and quinces coming on, though the birds always get to the cherries before we do. I enjoy genealogy and have spent some time doing that, for others as well as myself. Like many others, I’ve cleared out cupboards and drawers and got rid of things no longer needed. I put a box of books outside the gate for people to help themselves to, replenishing it as they were taken. That felt good. My husband is missing his trips to the gym so has been running three times a week, either a 3 or 5 or on two occasions an 8 mile route. We walk the dog twice a day on our friend’s field opposite the house with occasional longer walks round the village. TV watching hasn’t changed. Lunch while watching Bargain Hunt which is a nice distraction. N then watches the news. In the evening I enjoy quizzes such as Mastermind, Only Connect and Pointless, and cooking programmes like The Greta British Menu and Masterchef but most of those have finished now. I enjoy the Great British Sewing Bee. We watch Poirot (all of which we’ve seen before). There’s nothing much worth while watching really. We’ve watched a couple of DVDs. As I said earlier, N. watches a lot of news which I leave him to and he often goes to listen to music in his study while I watch my programmes. It’s not a bad thing to be able to spend some time apart in this situation. For example, I am writing this sitting in my garden beach hut while N. is writing poems in his study. We know that we are very fortunate to have this space and I am very aware that for many people lockdown must be extremely difficult because of where they live. We both read, me mostly when I go to bed. I’ve just finished Gerald Durrell’s Corfu Trilogy having enjoyed watching The Durrells on TV. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have a book here in the beach hut – The Trials of the King of Hampshire (non-fiction historical) and there’s a biography of Mrs. Beeton on the kitchen table rather appropriately! which I sometimes dip into while eating. N. has started having the Saturday Guardian delivered which keeps him happy for most of the week. I haven’t listened to much radio, though I occasionally have it on while I’m cooking. Radio 4. I used to have Today on in the morning but it’s too much these days. I like the comedy programmes such as I’m Sorry I haven’t a clue or The Unbelievable Truth. There’s sometimes a good play or documentary. Personal hygiene We’ve certainly been doing the hand-washing that’s recommended, even though we aren’t going out. We always wash our hands when touching anything that’s come into the house – mail, deliveries etc. And I use an anti-bac wipe on the gate handle when people come through. Like just about everyone, our hair has grown! I always’ cut N’s so he’s all right but mine is usually quite short. I’ve had a go at trimming it myself a bit which seems OK, but I’ve just been styling it differently and it’s fine. Sleep There’s been no change in our sleep patterns at all. Though this is an interesting question for us as my husband has a sleep disorder which means we are used to disturbed nights. He has something called REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder which basically means that he enacts his dreams, which are usually quite active, e.g. running away from animals, fighting off assailants or wasps. This inevitably wakes me up, and we have had to make adjustments to our bedroom to accommodate it, e.g. a very low bed, foam pieces around his side of the bed, as he has thrown himself out several times in the past, causing quite severe injury. He has medication that has helped a bit. Other than that, it’s been perfectly normal!"

Everyday health and wellbeing. Health and wellbeing, let's start with health. I've always been able to consider myself a healthy man generally speaking. I've pretty much been able to steer clear of hospitals so far in my life, though now that I've reached the age of sixty, stopped working, and found time to sit on my arse and relax, I'm beginning to notice some wear and tear. If I were to describe in my own words what I feel a healthy body is, I would say; “one in full working order”. And mine, for the time being at least, is holding up. But lets take stock, and I'll start at the top and work downwards. Without spectacles my eyesight is poor, very poor in fact. I'm wanting to see an optician in order to have another eye test and then buy a pair of specs that are strong enough to do the job for another three or four years. If I look back through my diary I will be able to find the very day I took receipt of the specs currently perched on my nose, but for now I will settle for sometime in 2017. I'm typing this document using a size 12 font, and to be honest, though it must have been adequate at the start of the year, it now seems very small to me. To illustrate how bad my eyesight is without spectacles, I've just revisited the first paragraph of this very document and increased the font size to 28 and then removed my spectacles. I couldn't make out a single word of it. It was just a jumble of black squiggles and vertical lines, and could have been an entirely different language for all I could make of it. Next up is my left ear, maybe even both ears for all I know, but definitely the left one is dimmer than it needs to be. At first I thought that it may just be a simple problem like earwax needing to be cleaned out, or a bit of an infection, but alas no. I fear I may be going deaf in my left ear. There are of course different degrees of deafness, just as there are different degrees of sight loss, and I'm definitely not blind or deaf. But there has been a definite deterioration over this past year in both sight and sound. Next for inspection is my right elbow. It aches, and I can pinpoint the very day it started aching. It was during a bowls competition held at my bowls club in mid September, Crown Green rules for the purist that needs to know, and I did rather well that afternoon. So well in fact that I found myself in the final, but to get there I had to play three matches in quick succession, and frankly speaking my right elbow and upper arm were beginning to feel the strain of it. Though I lost the final game of the day fair and square, I've had to nurse my elbow ever since. And though I've not rolled a wood in anger since the green closed down two months ago, the ache is more noticeable than it ever was. I'm thinking perhaps a bit of rheumatism has set in. We now reach my stomach, of which there is a bit more than there should be, and certainly a lot more now that I've finished my career in the Prison Service, than there was when I started it. On the right side of my little fat belly I developed an itch about a year ago, and after seeing a small spotty rash appear, I visited my doctor who told me it was nothing to worry about and he prescribed me some ointment to take care of it. The small rash is still there, it still itches from time to time, and again I need the doctor to prescribe something else for it and lets see if I can't be rid of the irritation. Now the big one, my hernia. It was towards the end of last year, September -October time that I felt a lump in my groin. Not wanting to prevaricate over the matter I was at the doctors surgery pretty sharpish on this occasion. She had a good prod and a poke around and agreed that it looked very much like a classic hernia. On 21st January of this year, I had an appointment at the Ultrasound and X-ray department of our local hospital, where a reed thin Asian Doctor did a thorough job of checking out my stomach. He reiterated that I did indeed have a hernia, and that I would receive a letter from the NHS informing me how to go about registering myself for surgery to correct the problem. I registered myself online, it was a simple enough process, and then it was just a matter of waiting my turn to get it dealt with. And then came the Covid-19 virus, that has put a stop on everything. In August I received a letter from the NHS, its still stuck to my fridge with a “Rasta-man” fridge magnet from Saint Lucia, telling me that I am still on the waiting list and could I please remain a patient patient and wait a while longer yet? And since then, absolutely nothing. We are currently on our second lockdown of the year, which is why I cannot get to sit in front of an optician or my GP, I can't even get a haircut at the minute, so the chances of being called in for a hernia operation anytime soon are simply none existent. We simply have no choice but to get on with it. One thing that I am over though, is a year long, intermittent toothache or gum infection. My back left bottom molar had worked itself a little loose in the gum, it moved ever so slightly if I was ever daft enough to put my finger in my gob and test it. There was a constant throb attached with this molar that I treated with a regular daily diet of paracetamol and ibuprofen, but occasionally there was some pain too. Proper pain. An itchy belly or an aching elbow are one thing, a twinge in the groin whilst getting into or out of the car is another, but when my gum became so infected that I sought out emergency aid from a dentist, I was in a whole world of pain that was beyond what I could cope with. Eventually after two courses of very strong antibiotics, I was given an appointment to have the tooth removed. Although in itself not an enjoyable experience, I'm glad its out and the pain has never returned. I'm hoping it won't ever again. And finally, I'm so used to this now that I no longer see it as a health problem, just simply as something I have to put up with, my sleep apnoea. I suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, in so far as I go to sleep of a night and frequently stop breathing. This is not a good thing to do, I've been advised by those people that look after me in this respect that it would be for the best if I kept breathing, even whilst asleep. As an aide to this I have been given a CPAP machine, CPAP being Constant Positive Air Pressure. It sits on my little bedside table like a small shoebox, and from it comes a two metre long flexible hose, at the end of which is a face mask that fits over my mouth and nose forming a seal, and is held in place by a harness. As soon as the machine registers that I am wearing the mask, it starts to gently blow air down the tube and into the face mask. The clever thing about it though, is the fact that it knows when I'm asleep, and how deep a sleep I am in at the time. It then regulates the amount of air I need pushing down my throat in order to keep my airway open. It also stores loads of information that can be accessed remotely from the people working at the Chest Clinic at Royal Preston Hospital via our Wi-Fi. Like the time the mask is put on and taken off, the level of air pressure needed to maintain the airway etc.. it really is a smart bit of kit. The result of it is that I now sleep properly, much better than I had been before being diagnosed with apnoea, and I'm not putting my heart under such pressure as it had been, due to my body not getting enough oxygen whilst asleep. And there it is, my introduction to the term of “everyday health”, a two page list of aches and pains, in a body that is slowing down and dimming at an alarming rate. Yet if you were to ask me how I was feeling, I'd tell you I was fine, tip top, and with nothing to worry about. So what of wellbeing, and more importantly, my wellbeing? To be honest the word seems new to me, as if its a modern word for something else. Happiness, contentment, being relaxed, satisfied, comfortable in your surroundings, confident of your abilities, at ease with yourself and the company you're keeping. If someone was to ask me; “Are you well?” I'd be thinking along those lines and saying “Yeah, not bad at all thanks, You?” I certainly wouldn't be saying anything about aches and pains and the fact that part of my bowel is poking into my scrotum and generally becoming a nuisance down there. As a child and a young man, I took my health for granted. And in those times I don't think I was any different to my peers. I was healthy from one years end to the other, except if I caught a cold, or measles, or chicken pox. Or alternatively poisoned myself eating a dodgy ham bun from a cafe on the way to a football match, Carlisle United, thanks very much. As for my wellbeing, it never seemed to be an issue, I was a kid growing up and doing kid stuff with other kids. I was simply happy for the most part. At least that's how I remember it. Mental health was something that we children didn't understand, and when I say children I mean the twelve, thirteen, fourteen year old us, me and my mates. As far as I could make out we were as happy as clams, all of us. We understood that there were crazy people in the world, madmen that would murder you and throw your body into the sea, that sort of stuff. But some man or woman that lived nearby and had “issues”, depression or whatever? It simply didn't compute. Besides, there were loony bins for them sort. One of my mates had an elder sister, S. As a thirteen year old boy I adored her, but she simply looked at me as one of the oik's that hung around with her daft brother. It soon became apparent to us all that S was “developing”, and it also dawned upon us that from time to time she went bat shit crazy, screaming all manner of threats and what have you if we even entered the same room she was in. Sooner or later this was explained to us by my mates Mam, who pulled us to one side and told us that this was all down to her “period pains”, and that eventually she'd be right as rain again. My mate and I just shrugged and he learned to see these periods coming and we kept out of her way when she got them. But we never thought she was a loony or anything. I never paid much conscious attention to my own wellbeing, even as I was developing into a young man myself. I simply saw life as a series of days and weeks that were best enjoyed if I was happy. And for the most part I was. I now understand that I had an incredibly stable homelife, with two hard working and devoted parents who not only cared for me, but a younger brother and sister too. I grew up in a working class town, of a working class family, and Dad was always, but always employed. We were growing up in a town that was also pretty much exclusively white. Not that we thought about racial issues back then, I'm being totally honest with you when I say that I remember the very first time I spoke to a black man. It was on the fifth and final day day of the first test match being played by England against the West Indies, played at the Oval Cricket ground. We were having a family holiday in London at the time, and Dad, Uncle B, myself and my brother decided that we would spend a day at the cricket. Google tells me now, that it was 31st of July 1973, I was thirteen years old and stood in a queue waiting to buy four cans of pop from a van parked up in the corner of the stadium. The West Indian guy behind me struck up a conversation with me about who we thought would win the game. Now this was when racism was able to pretty much run free within our society unchecked. How growing up in a mixed race town, city, or whatever the environment would have affected my mental welfare I simply do not know. Suffice to say that if I were a black kid back then, then I don't suppose my life would have been so cosy and warm. As a twenty-seven year old man I joined the Prison Service, and quickly found out about mental stress. I don't want to dwell on the daily ins and outs of being a Prison Officer for the best part of three decades, but let it be suffice to say that life could become difficult at times for everybody on the other side of the wall. Let me copy and paste from my diary, from the 10th of September of this year.  Thursday 10th September. Within an hour of finishing the notes for yesterday, all hell broke loose within my head. A migraine headache had me in agonies I'd never suffered before, and to be honest it was debilitating. I'd started the afternoon well enough by marking a card for D.I and J.P. but within fifteen minutes I started with both a headache and a nagging throb in my jaw, as if the gum infection was back to haunt me. I handed the score card to my brother and retrieved some paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets from the car, taking two of each. These tablets were to fight a losing battle. My opponent was to be I.S. but he'd given word that he might not be able to make it on time as he was waiting on a plumber arriving at his house to deal with a problem, and so it proved. This offered me a bye into the last eight, but was the last thing on my mind as by now my headache had me pacing around the club car park with my head in my hands. The club secretary arrived and could see I was struggling, and for a moment or two we chatted as best I could, and she advised me to return home and rest up; “Stop trying to be all things to all people, you need to look after yourself. Leave the bar to someone else for the afternoon and go home.” And five minutes later I did. D was surprised to see me return so soon, but when I told her of my plight she was concerned. I took to my bed but couldn't bring myself to use the CPAP machine, for the entire left side of my head was in such a state that it had me gasping for relief. I rolled from side to side, trying to find a position in the bed that would offer some hint of comfort, but it wasn't happening. I couldn't lie down, I couldn't sit up, I couldn't pace around the room with my head in my hands, for I tried everything. I came downstairs to take a couple of D's codeine tablets to see if that would help, and then returned upstairs to lie in my bed whilst verbalising the pain I was in. Eventually I started to regulate my breathing, slowly in, then out again. The in was ok, the out again seemed to bring the pain. Slowly in, then out, concentrate on the slowly in, now out, slowly in.. and out.. slow it down.. gently in.. gently out.. gently in.. D woke me by gently shaking my foot. “Its half past five love, how's your head?” It had improved somewhat, thankfully. I'd spent perhaps forty-five minutes gasping with the agony of it, and had two and a half hours of sleep that had mercifully followed. My mouth ached a little, but my head felt ok relatively speaking. I was feeling woolly headed, of that there wasn't a doubt, almost as if I was bruised on the inside. But the torture had stopped. I could breathe again. I could move, slowly, no need to rush anything, just take it slow. More paracetamol and ibuprofen took the rest of the discomfort from my mouth. I dressed, sat in my chair and sighed, thank fuck that was over. I think yesterday was a bit of a reality check for me. I do worry over the decisions I make on behalf of the club, and I do spend a lot of time trying to make it a worthwhile place to visit for the members. But I need to remind myself that I'm not fully right in the head either. I didn't just embrace an early retirement because I wanted to, I did it because I had to. I was deemed unfit for work. Certainly unfit for working within a prison environment, as the job was killing me. Since stopping work in April 2014 and taking sick leave, and then finally being retired in December of that year, my mental health has slowly and steadily improved. And I suppose its easy to forget that there was ever a problem in the first place. Stress and anxiety were the words written upon the sick note, but to the man in the street, what does stress and anxiety look like? I look normal enough I suppose, I always have done. But when I think back to that time, I was a complete mess inside. The job had become toxic to me, and I knew that it had come to an end. Once the financial situation had been sorted out, and we knew what our income was likely to be each month, then I simply gave in to it and became “retired”. In many ways it has become an almost idyllic existence being retired and sitting on my arse for the six years since. D and I get on together like a pair of old shoes, independent of each other, yet the one would be looked upon as totally useless without the other. We love each other and are committed to looking after each other until the very end of our lives, which is a wonderful situation to be in, until one of us dies of course. The survivor then needs to survive as best they can alone, and that's a whole new episode to life that as yet I cannot, or will not, contemplate. Besides, it may be me that goes first. We have enough money, we take holidays every year, sometimes two a year. We own our own home and are comfortable within it, and we have a loving family who can and do support each other when needed. So where are the problems? We're both getting older is one problem. As we age we weaken, and in the time since I retired from working for a living, D has learned of the severity of her diabetes, ironically this was whilst in hospital waiting to undergo heart surgery. She now injects herself with insulin twice a day and takes a handful of pills for blood pressure, cholesterol, and the constant pain she suffers in her feet, legs and back. She is practically house bound at the moment and has been for a couple of years now. If she needed to walk to Asda from our house, gather a dozen items from the shelves, pay for them and then carry them back home in a shopping bag, she simply couldn't do so. As for me, I have a hernia that needs dealing with, and a recent letter I've received from the hospital tells me that I am on their radar, but things being as they are, I'm going to have to be a very patient patient. I also want to see a dentist to see if I can have any treatment for the intermittent agonies caused by the gum infections I've suffered this year. And I'm fully aware that in the grand scheme of things these are but minor inconveniences. There will soon enough be more urgent matters to attend to in the years to come. Things like cancers, Parkinson's, dementia, cirrhosis, and things that make you shit the bed, stuff like that that we can look forward to together. Hmm, that was a bad day I was writing about there. I'm happy to say that it hasn't been repeated since. One thing both D and I have achieved together for the benefit of our health, is to give up smoking. I did it first in around 2011 or 12, and D stopped smoking a year or two later when she was told that she needed a triple heart bypass. I consider it a real achievement on both our parts. Here's another couple of entries from last years diary relating to matters of health. Monday 10th June 2019. My poor wife. Today is the day I take her to the Hospital for a 2.30 pm appointment. She is to have a colonoscopy, and in order for this to happen she has had to fast since 6.00pm yesterday. She has also had to clean her system out, and this has proved to be hard work. At 7.00pm last night she had to start drinking a concoction that was given to her by the nurse practitioner when they met a few weeks back. This is basically a sachet of powder that was to be mixed with a litre of water, and drank over a period of two or three hours. Shortly after finishing this jug of liquid the fun began, as her bowels were cleared through at an alarming rate. I went to the pub and left her to it. She didn't come to bed last night, preferring to stay on the couch, and for the most of the night she had no sleep at all. And then at 7.00am this morning she was to open another sachet of the powder, mix it with another litre of water and start again. She has done this as directed, and the effects of this second litre has been alarming. I could hear her clumping up the stairs for the toilet from about 9.00am and she's had little rest or peace since. She did come to bed eventually, but only because the bedroom is closer to the toilet. Within five minutes of laying her head down, she was scuttling out again with her tummy rumbling loud enough for me to hear it. This has continued all morning and needs to stop soon, as we're setting off at 1.00pm for the drive to K. I'm thinking we may need to take a bucket with us and she can sit in the back seat where there is more room for her to manoeuvre should she need to. She'll be sitting atop a pile of newspapers and old towels whichever seat she sits in. Tuesday 11th June. I spent yesterday afternoon doing crosswords whilst sitting around various corridors at the hospital . D was having a grand old time whilst a Doctor B was rummaging around her bottom bits with a camera on a flexible stick. She tells me that she was able to watch the entire episode on two large screens positioned nearby, and in glorious full colour too. The result of this procedure is that the hospital, or at least Doctor B’s bit of it, are happy to say that D is cancer free. She does have some haemorrhoids that they found down there, but she's not to worry about them, so all in all it's good news and a clean bill of health. Except of course for the dicky heart, diabetes, high cholesterol, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, back pain, an occasional acid tongue and foul temper. By time we were finished it had gone half past four, and both of us were starving hungry. So as a treat, I asked her if she fancied a meal out at a restaurant once we were back in Barrow. This went down very well indeed, and she settled upon another newly opened Turkish restaurant at the end of Cavendish Street nearest Duke Street. I chose mixed shish kebabs, and D settled upon barbecued king prawns, both dishes coming with rice and salad. We still had room for a pudding each, and I suspect D could have eaten the tablecloth as well, such was her appetite. We took our time over this meal, we were wanting to savour it, and it was lovely too. We returned home after we'd eaten, and D stretched herself out on the couch and slept solidly for about four hours. My wife D is fifteen months older than me, and as such she reached the magical age of sixty before I made fifty-nine. As a sixty year old she became eligible for bowel cancer screening, and received through the post a poo stick and a plastic pot and a return envelope. The idea being that she'd wipe the stick in her poo, pop it in the pot, secure the lid and post it off the next time we passed a postbox. It was as a result of this that D was asked to report to the hospital outlined above. It had been noted that blood had been present in her sample, and so it needed checking out. I'm delighted to say that since then, I myself have reached the age of sixty and only this past week was sent a letter explaining that I now fall under the bowel cancer screening programme, and as such I will be receiving a poo stick of my own within the next fortnight. I think that is excellent. Excellent care from an excellent service. It's like a right of passage really, don't you think? But it all seems part of the plan, the NHS and our own GP's surgery are definitely being pro active when it comes to the simple stuff of screening and prevention. Only this week the nurse at the Doctors surgery rang D to ask her to call in for her Flu jab, the call took no more than a minute, a date and time were set, and I delivered her there two days ago. The jab was administered and D was back in the car inside of five minutes. That is excellent service, that is what the NHS is all about, taking care of us and not presenting us with a bill on the way out. We can mask our ailments and feelings from each other should we wish to, all except those that are closest to us. If D is upset over some matter or other then I know it. Likewise she can read me like a book, after all we've been together since 1982. But for all our aches and pains, diabetes and hernias, D and I can still scrub up well and put our glad rags on and look the part. We can meet with our friends and enjoy a good night out in good company. And we all do it without worrying or fussing over our ailments, because in some way or another we're all broken, cracked and chipped at the very least. I pass my time in the warmest half of the year on the bowling greens, and as a mere stripling of sixty I'm one of the younger players at our club. In our league matches we play twelve men to a team, so two dozen men in all. Of those I would say that two out of three need spectacles to see properly, about half of us will have at least one hearing aid tucked behind an ear, if not two. Maybe five or six will have mobility problems, difficulty walking, that sort of thing. Maybe as many again will have breathing difficulties. Three out of four will be on some kind of regular medication, even if only an aspirin a day to keep the blood thin. Then there are the creaking hips, the dodgy knees, seeping bladders etc.. too many to count. But the game is everything to us, that list of problems I've outlined there are not looked upon as health problems, just issues that we deal with day to day. The game on the other hand is our wellbeing. Our reason for gathering, practising, playing, taking the piss, enjoying each others company, sharing a beer or two and laughing along with each other. That for me, is what Crown Green Bowls is about, and if we come off the green at the end of the game sweating, puffing and panting and in need of a sit down, or a piss, or even a sit down piss, so be it. The bar is open and the winner buys his opponent a drink, that's how it works. I've learned that good health is good fortune, there are plenty of examples of people including children, who are struck with ill health, some terribly so. Some lives are cut tragically short, again I can thank good fortune and nothing else that I'm still alive and enjoying myself. I'm also aware that something or other quite dreadful is on the horizon, there simply is, because after all we all die of something eventually. I don't fear death, for to do so would be to fear the future, and there's so much good stuff to be getting on with in the meantime. My Dad is still alive, and for the time being at least he's still independent, though he has Alzheimer's. I took him out with me last week for a walk along the seafront on Walney Island, a pleasant afternoon for a short but pleasant walk. Dad is but five feet tall, slightly stooped forward, and his footing isn't as stable as it once was. We were on a narrow path, a path that over the years has been undermined by the sea and its high tides. Waiting ahead of us looking to come the opposite way was a tall young man who was dressed for running. I turned to Dad who was a few yards behind and gazing out to sea and seemingly in no hurry to make headway; “Hey Dad, come on mate, this lad here's waiting on us, and by the look of him he means business.” Snapping back into the here and now, Dad replies; “Oh aye, sorry son, let me just catch up..” Now the lad waiting for us to allow him access along this narrow section of path was a magnificent specimen of a man. Early twenties, easily over six feet tall, broad shouldered and with well muscled arms openly visible due to him wearing a T-shirt. He had a good complexion to him too, he simply looked healthy. Everything about him screamed “light-heavyweight boxer”, and if I read him all wrong, then I'll stake a months pension on him being one of the towns more serious Rugby League players, of which there are quite a few. When Dad caught up with me and we were able to allow this boy access to the path so he could commence his run, he gave us the thumbs up and a smile; “Cheers lads”, and he was on his way. “Christ, he's a big lad is yon bugger.” I didn't disagree; “He is that Dad, the sort that we'd want on our side eh?” And we both looked back to see him striding off at an easy pace. Now I simply don't have a clue as to who that young man was, but the little feller I was walking with, the man I call Dad, was once a fighter himself. Not a boxer, but Judo was his game, and back in the day when I was but eight or nine years old, he was the Lightweight Champion of the North of England. He was my hero. The only real difference between the pair of them is not the size, not the strength, not the training regime, not the diet, not the exercise, but just the matter of time, about sixty years I'd say. Dads eighty-three, a dodgy foot at the bottom end and a brain dying from within at the top end. That athletic young man we watched set out on his run would be no more than twenty-five tops. Fit, and we're talking fighting fit here, but the only difference between the pair of them is time. An adult lifetime. Life is what happens to ourselves between birth and death, wellbeing is our enjoyment of that life, and health is having the ability to live it as best we can. November 2020."

Covid-19 and Time.  Has “time” been disrupted for me and my wife D? No is the straight answer, not in the slightest. I've been retired and in receipt of a Prison Officers pension since December 2014, and since then I've grown used to time being on my side. Time to think, write, play bowls in the summer, drink whisky all year, keep an eye on Dad each day to see that he eats his tea meal, and generally try to be an all round decent sort of bloke to my family and friends. I like the unhurried lifestyle, it suits me. I used to have a fast pace about me, I walked fast and people commented on it. I think it was because I was a busy man back then, a job, a wife, two daughters, things to do, places to go. Them I'm talking about, not me. Hell no, it was my job to ferry them around, a lift here and a favour done there, I galloped through my day to get my women to somewhere else. Now I've retired and my daughters have moved into their own homes, a calmness has befallen upon me, and my world has slowed down to a gentler pace, which suits me fine as now I have a hernia to worry about, and it doesn't suit to keep galloping anyway lest bits of me start to pack up or drop off all together. Neither my wife or I have any worries about sleep, though I need the use of a CPAP machine to push air down my throat of a night due to having sleep apnoea. Without it I tend to stop breathing whilst asleep and that's not a good thing to do. But I only mention sleep insofar as time only starts when we wake up, or I wake up is probably more accurate. I get out of bed between 9.00am and 9.30am most mornings. D on the other hand is shameless and can slumber on until after noon. At the start of the lockdown we found it easy, but boring. We've always been comfortable in each others company, but not being able go anywhere or do anything more constructive than a bit of food shopping every few days, did leave us feeling at a loose end. We read, we ate, we bought Netflix and slobbed out in front of the television for far too long of a night, and went back to bed for it all to start again. D has been furloughed from her job as a barmaid, though she may be headed back to work in the next couple of weeks, between us we've had pretty much nothing to do and all day in which to do it. As the restrictions were lifted, and we were allowed to spend more time outside of our homes, I've been on some nice walks along Walney Channel and further afield. And I've also taken off in my car to explore the lanes of Furness less well travelled. And that has turned out to be something I've enjoyed doing, either alone or with Dad. Being able to pick Dad up from his house and take him out in the car for an hour or more has been satisfying for the both of us. Dad has Alzheimer's and its a terrible thing to witness the slow insidious destruction of his brain from within. Here's me with time to burn, and Dad loses time from the days start to its eventual end. By which I mean he can eat a meal ten minutes prior to me arriving at his house, but won't be able to tell me what it was. It has often been said by myself and commented upon by my neighbours, that the days just seemed to meld into one another in a seamless fashion at the start of the lockdown. The only event that brought us back into focus was Thursday morning, when the bins were emptied, other than that a week could easily have held nine days or six. One thing that I have kept an eye on whilst out on my drives or walks, with or without Dad, is the tide. The tides have become more noticeable now that I've had time in which to notice them. The vast expanse of the clean washed sands of the Duddon Estuary that are left exposed to view when the tide is out is a thing of beauty, especially when viewed from atop of Kirkby Moor. Just as a high tide within Walney Channel brings with it an energy that has the little boats moored within it bobbing up and down and facing into the incoming wind with a determination, not unlike a form of  mechanical seabirds. There is one respect in which time has stretched itself, and that is in the ability to see a Dentist or Doctor. I'm sure that these positions are well paid, probably fair to say they're very well paid indeed, but you try and get to see one face to face. These past five months has seen waiting rooms of either profession shut to the public. I have had the misfortune of suffering a gum infection and a loose molar, and pain was plentiful in the early weeks of the lockdown. I'd actually made an appointment early in the new year to see my Dentist, and I was informed that I'd be seen in February when a new dentist was due to join the practice. This was then put back a month due to the Dentist delaying their start date. Then came the Covid-19 virus and the doors were locked shut. I'm still unaware if my new Dentist is even in place yet or not. As my pain steadily tormented me to levels beyond fair, I sought out help. This was basically a telephone call from a dental practitioner who patiently listened to my woes, and promptly arranged for a course of strong antibiotics to be made available for me at a chemist shop in town. A fortnight later, I received another call from a gentleman with a South African accent, enquiring as to the level of pain I was now experiencing. His point being that the only treatment open to me was to have a tooth, or any number of teeth, extracted. Though seeing as the antibiotics had brought the level of pain down from torture, to a degree of discomfort, I thanked him for his offer but politely declined. As for when I do finally get to see a dentist and receive some treatment, a descaling at least, is anybody's guess. Thankfully I am currently pain free and hope to remain so. I'm led to believe that the Doctors surgeries are similarly being kept empty. Repeat prescriptions can be requested online, a short telephone consultation with a Doctor can be booked for those in the direst of needs, and after that its either the hospital you look to, or the undertaker. Whereas just six months past, their waiting rooms were filled with all manner of ailing, failing and malingering needy people, today the surgeries are being kept empty. It would surprise me not, that as I'm typing these notes out now, Doctors and Dentists are quietly strolling around the nations golf courses cheerfully playing each other for a wager of £50 per hole. If I delve deep into my daily journal I will find the date when it was that I discovered an alarming lump in my groin, a hernia is what I expected to be told was my problem, and so it proved. I've since been to the hospital for a ultra-sound scan, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a very thorough Asian gentleman, who also reassured me that there weren't any other sinister happenings going on in that region. And so I registered myself for surgery as and when it became my turn. I'm still waiting. Last week, I contacted the people in charge of the appointments book for Furness General Hospital, if such a book actually exists, and I was informed that they do indeed have all my details, I am on the list for surgery to have my hernia corrected, but unfortunately no such procedures are taking place right now. Nor could they tell me when such procedures would resume, other than to confirm that only the most extreme cases would be dealt with at first anyway, and if I felt that my quality of life was suffering greatly, then I needed to consult with my Doctor again in order that I be made a priority. Other than that, all that is left for me to do is wait. I'm getting good at waiting.  The towns football team are waiting too. They're waiting for the delayed football season to start, for this season sees them playing back in the football league after having spent forty-eight years in the non-league wilderness. Now in the grand scheme of things, whilst people are losing their jobs, others falling ill with this virus, and the economy tanking, football may not be to high a priority for some, and that's fair enough. But for myself and many of my friends, we're like kids waiting for Christmas. I've already purchased a season ticket though I don't know if I, or anyone else for that matter, will be allowed into a stadium to watch a game. Regardless, the fixtures are being released this Friday morning, and to be able to pore over this seasons fixture list, I simply cannot wait."

The ambulance arrived immediately as it was very quiet with no-one calling. The A&E at the hospital was similarly empty but fully staffed and I was seen quickly and was able to go home after a couple of hours. All the time I was at hospital there were only 2 other patients in the A&E department. Because my husband was not allowed to accompany me due to the Covid restrictions I had to call my daughter to come and collect me and take me home. Seemed a bit odd! Apart from that I have not had any physical issues at all during lockdown. Neither has my husband. Mentally I have been okay although there are days when I feel low but this passes quite quickly and I walk through the local fields with our dog which is a great boost to my spirits.Emotionally I have been fine. I miss my children and grandchildren but its something we have to do - so I just get on with it.The government - I think the government has done a good job regarding the decisions made. It is very easy for the press and the other political parties to be wise after the event. No-one could have foreseen this and the government is helping people as much as practically possible.As a country we have to get back to work. I believe that over the coming weeks and months restrictions will be gradually lifted. I believe that if the cases of the virus goes up then restrictions will be imposed again.News - I listen to the news once a day; but only a short 3 minute bulletin. Listening to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme is the most depressing thing as it is so biased and so depressing.I do listen to the daily Government Broadcasts at 5pm. I call it 'misery hour.' I think the daily government minister and experts are good. The questions from the general public are good. The questions from the press are hostile and repetitive. It's like they don't listen to each other. The same question is asked by every different reporter. The women reporters are usually more hostile than the men. They don't see understand how much this type of interrogations put people off.I have not experienced any challenges when accessing the news. As said I only watch the 5pm broadcast and listen to one other bulleting. I did not know about a petition regarding BSL. I wear hearing aids myself and I put on sub-titles if I find I cannot hear a programme.2Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland is a law unto herself. No doubt she has a BSL interpreter to ensue she scores a point with the politically correct brigade.Work and home life - I am retired so working from home/furloughed does not apply. There are just the 2 of us in our home and we have been fineTechnology- I was already familiar with Syke, Facetime and Whatsapp and have used these to keep in contact with children/grandchildren. I am a member of several social groups and have enjoyed zoom meetings. Zoom was a new experience and is very good except that everyone has a tendency to talk over each other. It is nice to catch up though. I've not found it stressful or a challenge as I like to think I am quite savvy when it comes to technology.I am a member of Facebook and use it primarily to keep in touch with a cousin in Nebraska USA and my WI group but otherwise try to use it as little as possible. I find it incredible that people are taken in by the absolute rubbish and vitriol which is posted on it by people who are quite pleasant if you meet them in real life. If you dare to post a different point of view then the dislike and hate which comes your way is palatable. If you rely on Facebook for any true news then you are quite likely to be disappointed. Because of the evils of Facebook I don't touch any other social media platforms.Shopping and food - . My husband has asthma so I have done all the shopping. This was a challenge at first. I had not used my online shopping account with Sainsburys for a while and found I was locked out of my account and completely unable to contact their helpline. was able to use Iceland Home delivery service and they were great. In order to avoid going to a supermarket more than once a fortnight I found that Abel and Cole were offering a non­ organic veg box which I have delivered weekly. Apart from going to a local store for milk and bread I am able to avoid the larger shops for the most part. From my experience in shopping in person I think the smaller shops are doing much better on the social distancing than the larger ones. You may have to queue at 2 metre intervals at the checkouts and in the queue to get inside but once you are in the shop then its impossible to keep the correct distance with in-store shoppers who just walk up close to you to get to the shelves, totally ignoring the in-store customers who are trying to play by the rules. In the smaller co-ops for example, where they operate a one-out, one-in system I feel much safer.Entertainment and leisure - I promised myself this year that I would not race about too much and have more time for myself-you should be careful what you wish for! I have rediscovered my love for jigsaws and have completed 3 hard ones so far. I enjoy alternate days walking the dog and have discovered some lovely walks right on my doorstep. Usually I drive to a local park and walk but its too crowded with joggers and cyclists at the moment so I am avoiding it. My husband walks our dog on the days I don't. On my non dog-walking days I walk locally for at least 40 minutes. I enjoy listening to Scala Radio and Magic Radio3and I try not to start watching TV until at least 4pm. Sometimes in the evening we will play games such as Scrabble or Mexican Train. I read a lot. I potter in the garden. I don't do any DIY. Housework is not something I enjoy, ever, and continue to do it as I normally do - when it needs doing. I have felt no compunction to start cleaning out cupboards! I have 6 grandchildren ranging from 3 to 17. I keep in touch with the older 2 (12 and 17) via Facetime but the other ones - 3, 5, 6 and 7 I have started to write to. Short letters and cards once a week which they really seem to enjoy getting. Hats off to the Royal Mail for keeping the mail deliveries going. It's beginning to be a struggle to think of things to say in my letters but I am managing to find various puzzles and photos to send. All in all I am surprised at how quickly the time has passed although I am getting a bit bored at times.Personal hygiene - My daily habits have remained the same. I set the alarm for 7am and I shower every morning. Normally I put on make up every day but I don't bother all the time at the moment. I always wear makeup to the shops or even to post a letter.Sleep - Funnily enough I have slept better over the past few weeks than I have other the past few years! I am aware that we are fortunate in that we don't have a job to worry about or an income in jeopardy. I worry for our children but manage to keep busy enough during the day to ensure a good nights sleep. My dreams, as far as I can remember have remained untroubles."

I remember at the time being horrified at the way the Chinese citizens were being treated if they refused to adhere to the stringent lockdown rules. People and streets being sprayed with disinfectant and some residents being dragged into ambulances. It seemed so barbaric but in retrospect perhaps some more harshness wouldn’t have gone amiss in the UK.! We had a holiday booked for April 12th. We were to fly to New York stay for a few nights and then embark on a Transatlantic cruise back to Southampton. My daughter and friends also had a holiday to Tenerife booked for around the same time. There was much discussion about whether it would be safe to go. We all thought at that time that it would. Little did we know. I have now written some of the experiences from the past three months. If they are dated they were written at the time others are thoughts and memories in retrospect. 3rd March 2020... We have decided that we do not want to go on our holiday regardless of whether we are reimbursed or not. It is just too risky, so today we cancelled the day tour we have booked for our tour in New York and got an immediate refund thank goodness. I have also cancelled our day trip to Honfleur as part of our cruise. We are trying to get as much money back on sundries as possible as at the moment the cruise company isn’t cancelling. If they don’t cancel we are unlikely to get our money back. There are several cases of Coronavirus on Princess cruise ships. 16th March 2020 At indoor bowls this morning I felt slightly nervous about mixing with other players due to the spread of Coronavirus. The numbers seem fairly small at the moment but there is some scary talk around. Italy in particular sounds a terrible place to be the rapid spread is very frightening. A bowler came in and immediately started coughing and saying that he feels under the weather and then stating he has just flown in from Tenerife. Why oh why has he come. I stay the other side of the room all morning. We decided afterwards to give bowls a miss for a while. 12th March 2020. We went to Sainsbury’s to do a shop in case we are forced to stay in. It was like Christmas it was so busy but we managed to get most of what we needed. I wore gloves the whole time, the only drawback was the touch screen when going to pay only accepts skin contact so that worried me. I sanitised my hands immediately. 15th March 2020 things seem to be getting serious now with the spread of the virus. We are being told to socially distance ourselves particularly the vulnerable and 70’s and over. We are just coming up to that age and I have had lung problems for many years so feel even more vulnerable. I have a few friends all roughly the same age who will soon have to restrict their movements so I have set up a support group for us. The over 70’s isolation group. We had our first meeting this morning down at our beach hut. Four couples all sitting 2 metres apart from each other. We had a laugh and a chat but there was definitely an air of uncertainty. 19th March 2020. I have a really bad lung pain all week, I think that I got a chill on the beach whilst meeting our friends. Eventually I phoned the GP and he wanted me to go for an X-Ray because of my previously problems. I was really nervous about this. I had had a bad chest infection in early January so was unsure of what to do. I had a feeling that the hospitals might be a hot bed of virus infection. We eventually did go up to the X-Ray department and were actually in and out within 15 misn. We didn’t even have to pay the car park fee it was that efficient. I was prescribed anti biotics but didn’t really get to see the GP as lockdown had suddenly come into force. All I know from the doctor’s receptionist is that I have to have another one in three months’ time. Not sure why but because of the crisis I didn’t want to bother the GP. We will decide that in the future I think! We now know that officially we have to stay indoors so our group has retreated to an online one via WhatsApp. Keeping each other supplied with info about online slots at supermarkets etc. also sending jokes and videos. It has been a scary few weeks with far more to come. On the 25th of March the Government asked for 250,000 volunteers to help with shopping delivering medicines etc., 405,000 volunteers signed up in 24 hours. People the size of the population of Coventry, it makes you proud. Easter Sunday. 2020 The Pope gave his Easter Sunday address from the closed St Peters Basilica, an absolutely magnificent surround. The Archbishop of Canterbury gave his Easter Sunday address from his kitchen in Lambeth Palace what a contrast.! Not a good one either, I found it a little embarrassing. Sometimes we need a little Pomp and Circumstance. The builders on the site next to us are carrying on as normal. Sitting together in vans or on our wall having a cigarette there is no distancing what so ever. There has been such a tremendous surge in people wanting to rent an allotment that we have now closed the waiting list. We now have a waiting list to go on the waiting list. I guess the plots will sadly stay vacant for a while as we are not allowed to show people around. What a waste of time and growing potential. Still rules are rules and are there for a reason. The beaches are deserted but someone has written a “Stay Safe” poignant note with out of the chalk rocks. ../Pictures/Photos%20Library.photoslibrary/resources/media/version/1d/00/fullsizeoutput_1d24.jpegThe local Face Book page erupted yesterday when three people were spotted surfing. Suddenly there are online vigilantes talking about distancing etc. I am not sure how I felt. They were young and of course thought themselves to be invincible, the annoyance would be if they got into difficulties and had to call the rescue services out, who would then have no choice about social distancing. A young couple over the road have constant visitors from their family, all crowding around the gate on a daily basis. It is getting a little tiresome. They are not adhering to any of the guild lines about family visiting or social distancing. barely staying safe. 1st April 2020 My brother who lives in the Ilse-of Man has been rushed into hospital this has been frightening for my niece. And very worrying for us. She said that the paramedics were gowned and masked which seemed to make it more serious and frightening for her. He has had the Covid 19 test but this will be a few days for the results as they have to be flown to Liverpool for testing. He is 72 and has COPD and apparently has been told that if he has Covid he will NOT be put on a ventilator. This is dreadful. April 3rd 2020 Good news is that he hasn’t got COVID but does have pneumonia. He was discharged on the 5th April as it is deemed unsafe to be in the hospital. The daily death toll is looking to overtake Italy. I assumed Italy was bad because of all kissing hello obviously not, 15th April 2020 at last our holiday has been officially cancelled. No doubt we shall have to wait some while for a refund. We have been offered 100% cash back or 125% future cruise credit. Who knows what the future holds so have opted for a refund. We are doing Online grocery shopping at Sainsburys, and because I already have an account can do a click and collect. It is getting addictive. And quite good fun. At the moment though some of the basics are in very short supply flour rice eggs yeast etc. Meal planning and eating now seem to be in the forefront of my mind from waking till bedtime? Sourcing our usual wine is proving difficult. I have resorted to sending away for 6/12 bottles at a time from online wine merchants as Sainsburys have run out of our usual tipple. We shall all be heavy drinkers by the end of this. Most of friends say the same. With no one eating out and, on the beach, we wonder what the seagulls are eating Thursday night there was a hand clap for NHS I actually felt this to be slightly weird...seems the public either love it or hate it What news that Boris Johnson the Prime Minister has the virus and even more shocking when he was taken into hospital and then intensive care. This is getting really frightening. Famous people are dying some of natural causes, the papers are so full of Covid 19 they are not getting the usual grand obituaries. I wonder what Prince Harry thinks so far from home. I bet that he is regretting his decision to leave the country with Megan and the baby. He must be really worried about his family and friends especially as prince Charles had also had the virus. The Queens address to the nation with the theme of we’ll meet again was watched by millions I watched it and it was poignant, it made me a little emotional. It feels like we are fighting a real war. Thinking of TV, some of the programmes filmed at home just don’t work. Have I got news for you being the worst? There is a plethora of celebs doing little sound bites from their own homes to keep fit etc. Have to say not interested they have all become Irrelevant somehow. I am happy to watch repeats of drams and comedies. We have been watching the Covid 19 update from Number 10 everyday but it seems to be getting a little tedious. I just wonder what is going on in the rest of the world apart from this virus. We are trying to keep fit., by playing pool and working on the allotment. I am doing jigsaws, and going to bed earlier than usual. I wonder if people are no less likely to visit A&E and the GP surgeries I am thinking more about the hypochondriacs and time wasters, will habits change for good I wonder. I hope so. what happens in the future I think that I will be always wary of walking close to others. Today the Post lady tried to deliver parcels to house opposite today. They were out and she was clearly frustrated. I offered to help and take them in but she said she was not allowed she had to go back to the van do paper work and retake the parcels. She was grumbling* that it was worse than Christmas but with only half of the staff. She said she couldn’t understand people ordering paddling pools and fake grass. I can, actually if you are stuck indoors you need something to do. Just a strain on services I guess. Life goes on, Great Tits are nesting in the box and Robin is out singing. Feels today on April 22nd that people are relaxing their fears there seems to be more people passing the window. I went for one of my twice weekly walks but stayed on the cliff top as there were so many dog walkers on the beach. We can’t use our beach hut which is a pain, especially as it costs over £1000 a year to rent. Never mind better safe than sorry. Lovely weather this week we have been working on the allotment and rejoicing in the asparagus spears that are emerging. The birds are singing and the general feeling of well­being this brings makes this emerging crisis seems invisible. How hard it must be to be living in the city or a small flat with family. All on top of each other. I bet domestic violence and abuse of all kinds have increased. Boots have stated they can be a safe point for sufferers of abuse...not sure whether this is fake news as I can’t see how they manage that unless they allow them to use the phone? May 12 2020. Hurrah all our money has been refunded for our cancelled holiday. Monday June 1st 2020 A very sad today as a neighbour four doors down is being buried today. She worked in a London hospital and contracted the virus about 6 weeks ago and has been in a ventilator for some time. She leaves behind a husband and two teenage children. The numbers at the funeral are restricted and the family cannot travel to the cemetery in the funeral cars. All of the street came out and stood in respect as the hearse left. A colleague of hers gave everyone a pink rose and we walked to the harbour and threw the roses into the sea and sent her on her way so to speak. It was very sad and very sobering to know someone that has died of this dreadful and unforgiving virus. The next day the daughter wrote a heartfelt plea on social media for people to take notice of the restrictions and not meet up in crowds. She said that she was heartbroken at the sight if so many people taking no notice of lockdown. Part 2: Spring Covid 19 Update Health (some comments may be repeated from above) repeated sections are in italics My daughter who lives several hundred miles away was very unwell at the beginning of the spread of the virus. She is a single mother and had no one to get shopping or medicines etc., her ex wasn’t being that helpful although he did take the children. I was sending her a thermometer pain killers and throat sweets etc, by post. She was unable to speak to 111 as her throat was so bad but managed to email them. they just said stay indoors. This lasted over 3 weeks and she messaged to say that she had a bag packed in the hall in case she had to contact an ambulance she felt so ill. She was very alone and we felt very helpless. It would be good to have a test available for anyone that has been severely ill to see whether you have had the virus. 19th March 2020. I have a really bad lung pain all week, I think that I got a chill on the beach whilst meeting our friends. Eventually I phoned the GP and he wanted me to go for an X-Ray because of my previously problems. I was really nervous about this.

All I know from the doctor’s receptionist is that I have to have another one in three months’ time. Not sure why but because of the crisis I didn’t want to bother the GP. We will decide that in the future I think Our GP surgery will only do telephone triage, you are not allowed into the surgery unless by invitation of a GP. 1st April 2020 My brother who lives in the Ilse-of Man has been rushed into hospital this has been frightening for my niece. She said that the paramedics were gowned and masked which seemed to make it more serious and frightening for her. He has had the Covid 19 test but this will be a few days for the results as they have to be flown to Liverpool for testing.

Monday June 1st 2020 A very sad today as a neighbour four doors down is being buried today.

The next day the daughter wrote a heartfelt plea on social media for people to take notice of the restrictions and not meet up in crowds. She said that she was heartbroken at the sight if so many people taking no notice of lockdown. My husband had a hospital appointment with his consultant re a pelvic fracture. This was eventually rearranged and the consultant rang him at home and rebooked a face to face appointment for 6 months’ time. Emotionally I think that we have fared reasonably well. I am quite a fan of peace and quiet and do not needs crowds of people around me. I am missing the family of course but we can use the computer to see and talk to each other. I am enjoying the freedom from the rigidity of attending some meetings and clubs etc., all guilt free. If I haven’t read the book of the month for our book club it doesn’t matter we will not be discussing it. News Initially we watched all of the broadcasts re Covid avidly but this has really lessened off now. There was too much endless hour after hour. The Number 10 Government broadcasts were always a must, but less so now. It used to irritate me that the BBC never quite managed to start the broadcast on time always seemingly taken unaware that the PM or ministers had started. The charts were a bit boring, it was mainly the infection and daily death rate that we really wanted to know. I just wondered what we have missed that has gone on around the world that has gone unreported. A good time to break bad news so to speak as it probably wouldn’t have got a mention. The big news for us was Dominic Cummings breach of lockdown rules. Definitely one rule for him and one for others. We couldn’t believe that he still remains in office why? We wonder what does he know that we don’t. Work and Home Life We are retired so our daily routine has been unaffected. My daughter has been able to work from home but has had to manage two teenage boys and try to get them to do school work at the same time. They are at state school and have a certain amount of work set. But there is reluctance to do it. My sons’ children are at private school and the difference has been marked. The children have had to register on line each morning and they have a full lesson plan every day. Money makes a difference. The challenges for all of them have been huge. My son is self-employed so has had no income and doesn’t qualify for any help from the government. A big worry. Technology We have using Messenger to video talk to family, WhatsApp between friends and occasionally the good old-fashioned phone. We haven’t ventured onto Zoom yet but that may come. Shopping and food As I said before we have embraced on line shopping. We order food and my husband collects. This is extremely efficient and mostly we find a slot to suit us. The longest between shops have been 10 days, but that was only once. I have just started going out to the local fishmonger as they open very early so I can go out when it is quiet. Only one person is allowed in the shop at one time. I pay by contactless card so all pretty safe. I do not want to gout otherwise. The tourists that have been flocking to our seaside town has been horrendous. No social distances at all. We blame Dominic Cummins for this, people have seen his “getting away with it” as permission to flout the rules. There are no toilets open no car parks and no cafes. The streets are teeming and there is a stink of urine in the air. We are staying in. Entertainment and Leisure We have a very large allotment so that has kept us busy. It is about 20 meters from our house so perfectly safe to go to. We spend two hours a day there. We also play pool in the evening and sometimes board games. With the weather improving we can sit outside. There are plenty of jobs to do around the house but apart from clearing out a few drawers none of the jobs on the to do list have been done. We have probably done less in fact. Somehow it feels like permission has been given to let slip a bit. Personal Hygiene. This has stayed the same, daily showers and hair wash. The only bad thing has been our hair. We have just plucked up courage and given each other a hair cut after watching some tips on YouTube. The results have been ok. My next-door neighbour has grown a beard and now looks 5 years older. Sleep This has stayed much the same, sometimes worry about family has kept us awake. But we don’t need to rush up in the morning so it doesn’t really matter. Two of grandsons have been very worried, one refusing to go to the corner shop, and the other younger one afraid of going to sleep in case he dies. Very sad. Finally: The amount of death and infection to come as a result of this virus is truly dreadful. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but it does seem as if this country and government have been complacent and at times too slow to act. The PM being in hospital has slowed things but may have made a difference in other ways. He may be more empathic. Wearing of masks etc., why put a date in the future to start wearing them, travel restrictions should have been put into place much sooner and lockdown extended in terms of visiting beauty spots beaches etc., Let’s hope it all improves soon.

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? My issues both physical and mental have been very minor and have fluctuated between feeling a bit low or very positive – essentially quite normal. Initially, the lock-down presented minor challenges like making sure we had sufficient food supplies to meet an unknown period and as I was self-isolating the difficulty in getting online shopping slots. It was fortunate that two of my children live close by and they were happy to provide shopping services! A few weeks into lock-down, I started to get slots for online shopping which helped considerably: so getting the essentials was a challenge that created some stress but all manageable. I have not required any medical help. Physically, I should have gone for a walk outside more often but my wife was unhappy about doing this in case people were not observing social distancing. y. However, I have had a treadmill in the spare room for many years and we both used this so we have been able to exercise. and we have started to do more outside walking in our large local park and intend to keep this up in non-pandemic times – if there will be one! I am an avid reader and learner, so my early thoughts were that there would be plenty of time to do both. However, my wife whilst finding some solace in This Morning, thought we should be ‘doing stuff’. Using online shopping for paint and decorating supplies, we have decorated two bedrooms and the main bathroom. I have also undertaken the task of replacing sealant on various windows and sinks etc., so this has provided more physical exercise and the satisfaction from completing the tasks has provided a good boost for us both. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services I think it worthwhile declaring my position here. I am a pacifist and left winger and also a member of the Green Party, CND and Global Justice Now. As such, neither this Government nor Boris Johnson curry much favour with me. My main thoughts on the political decisions made by this Government are that there has been too much politics involved in their decision making and the public health of the population has been not as considered as it should have been. It always seemed that the economy and growth were ahead of anything else but too many neo-liberals and free marketers were involved so this was always likely to happen. I would also cite that fact that the leading adviser ignored the restrictions and did not receive any punishment for doing so, a monumentally bad political decision. In mitigation, one could argue that the situation has not been one that has had to be dealt with previously but in my opinion, the lock-down did not start early enough, there was insufficient questioning of scientists in considering all available options and they did not learn from those who had faced the pandemic earlier. If they had done so I believe that the overall death total would have been substantially less. The PPE situation and the lack of management and consideration to care homes was a complete debacle and should never have happened. On the plus side, the furlough scheme and the help to those self-employed were good as was the drive to make the financial sector offer ‘holiday periods’. I am writing this at a time when non-essential shops are open and in a week, pubs, and restaurants will be allowed to open. The recent good weather has meant thousands have flocked to beaches and ignored social distance and other advice and I believe this could give rise to a second wave of the pandemic. This means that all of the scientific advice to go slowly with raising the lock-down will be for nought and restrictions will be imposed again. Johnsontalks of “no moreausterity” and a surge in infrastructure spending toboost the economy. Sadly I think it will not help the unemployment figures that will almost certainly rise and I wonder where he plans to get the cash to meet the costs of new infrastructure. He either has to borrow, hike the taxes or give an impression of being positive and decisive but with no real thought or cash – a bit like the garden bridge that failed miserably. Thus, I think that “no more austerity” may not apply to the elites! News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services I have little or no faith in mainstream media and cancelled all of my social media accounts some while ago. I rely on several trusted internet sources to provide details of the pandemic in this country and others, especially Europe and the USA. In this way, I can keep up-to-date with the measure being implemented on a wider basis. The Economist has been a good source and some of their Leaders will have made uncomfortable reading for this Government. Other sources include The Conversation, Open Democracy and Jonathan Cook. I have watched the daily briefings but generally find that after about 30 minutes. There is little of substance so my main reason for watching is the get the numbers and detail of changes to the lock-down policy. I heard somebody say that the briefings had been dubbed ‘Hancock’s Half Hour’ alluding to the less than inspiring Health Secretary, Matt Hancock and this sums up the situation nicely. I saw an interview with the Icelandic Prime Minister who stated that she left most of the briefings to “the people who know what they are talking about” namely the scientists and the heads of public health. In this way, she felt that the population was being given accurate findings without any political influence and I applaud this thinking. The question about the use of BSL interpreters is a no-brainer – why would you not have them? Current events around ‘Black Lives matter’ just emphasise the need to have equality throughout our society and to have an interpreter is one tiny piece in the overall picture. I am an admirer of Nicola Sturgeon and why Boris Johnson could not have followed suit is beyond me. Going back to an earlier point about looking at the ways others have dealt with the pandemic, Johnson should have looked at her and other female leaders, such as Angela Merkel in Germany, Jacinda Arden in New Zealand and Katrín Jakobsdttir in Iceland who have done a lot better than those countries led by men. Despite having little faith in the BBC which seems now to be the mouthpiece for this Government, I have watched the news that follows the briefing to get a concise picture of the briefing waffle. I sometimes feel that their Health and Science editors, Hugh Pym and Fergus Walsh respectively seem to fit to burst with indignation over the Government’s handling but have to follow the managerial line! Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? At age 73, I am still doing administration for a Consultancy headed by a friend. This is not onerous and usually takes 2-3 hours per week. So essentially, there has been little change in work habits. The content has changed somewhat in that updating various databases have become the primary activity but for me, the work I do helps maintain the grey matter. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Two of my children and their partners are working from home and have had to adjust to keep themselvesmotivatedandfocused. Inmyelderson’scase,thismethodcouldbecomeanearlyfull­time method of working as his company are looking to implement the method as a way of reducing the cost of office space etc. My youngest son is a self-employed website developer whose primary workspace is his flat. He has very little work but has received the funding from the Government to compensate. This has taken any worry about rent payments etc. He has been walking regularly and is our shopping backup but has had to take steps to ensure he does not fall into binge-watching Netflix and visiting the fridge for snacks 27 times a day!! The main impact for my wife and I in self-isolation has been the loss of seeing our children in the house and holding them. The ones who live close by have ‘visited’ from the end of the drive for brief chats. We have also instigated a Sunday family Skype session where we all meet up for a chat for a couple of hours but it is not quite the same thing as having them physically near. My daughter has been very nervous about Covid and is not looking forward to a return to work – she is a special needs teacher – and is fearful that her College may not have all safety measures in place. This has meant that my wife has been called upon to provide additional comfort via Facetime etc. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I deleted all of my social media accounts, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest , YouTube and Instagram earlier this year when I realized that I had spent over an hour trawling through Instagram. I have developed a growing distraught of the sites and their usage of my information for some while but the Cambridge Analytics issue more or less convinced me to cut and run. I also read Cal Newport’s book ‘Digital Minimalism‘ andagreed with his thoughtsthatby using these sites we were changing our attention span and ability to read and work more deeply. I am an avid reader and learner but was finding my time on these was being eaten away by using social media and this had to change. Whatsapp and Google accounts have remained for the time being. The latter being for work and the former for two reasons. Firstly, an enterprising neighbour set up a community account so that those like myself who were self isolating could call upon those who were not to pick up prescriptions, newspapers and groceries etc., to help out. This has been extremely worthwhile and useful. Whatsapp also enables me to call and see my family easily and without cost. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services On a weekly basis on Sunday afternoon, we have had a family meet-up via Skype and this has been great. Not only does everybody get a chance to chat and see each other but we have a lot of fun and laughs having a ‘pub quiz’ usually of twenty questions on any subject created by one of us in rotation. This means that depending upon who is the creator, my wisdom scores high but can be very low when they have questions on latest music etc. Nevertheless, I can take something away and find out whether I should listen or watch. Having headed up an IT department and with a web developer son, not a great deal of today’s apps or forms of technology are that new to me but it is interesting to see how these are being adapted to daily use. I still have concerns about the ethics of Artificial Intelligence but that is for another Directive perhaps. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? As already mentioned, there was difficulty, initially, in obtaining shopping slots, but over time with the introduction of more being made available by the supermarket chains, it did become slightly easier with Asda being, for us, the most successful. A tad galling that my wife worked at Tesco for over 25 years but no favouritism shown but that’s life.Trying any of the other chains was a waste of time. I can remember back in the late 1980s when we had a bad winter trekking around in the cold and snow picking up shopping as and where one could find shops that had been able to get a delivery and one really has to be thankful that during the pandemic, this has not been the case. We have already seen evidence over the past few years in the gradual demise of High Street style of shopping and the growth of online ordering. What has surprised me is the range of products available online from plants and shrubs to DIY kit, paint and household requirements and health products. I usually frequent a lot of garden centres in the summer but this year a pretty successful display in the garden has been created via my laptop. Is this the new shopping? I suspect so, not for everything but unless there are specialist shops in a town or High Street, ‘goingtothe shops’ might be an outdated exercise. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had hoped to get a lot more reading and studying via various MOOC courses and whilst the reading time has been reasonably good, there has been no study. The reason for this is having found it was possible to obtain paint and DIY items online; I was under pressure to decorate two Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services bedrooms vacated by daughter prior to lock-down when she moved in with her partner. Why two bedrooms? Well, one was used as an actual bedroom and the other for storage mainly of her clothing and her work papers (she is a special needs teacher). These were completed and I was then on a roll in completing other outstanding DIY tasks. I was very disappointed with the programmes on television. Apart from one or two drama series, thank goodness for Vera and Endeavour, the providers seemed to rely upon reruns and repeats of programmes first aired 10 years ago – do we really need another viewing of the James Bond films? Fortunately, I am a subscriber to Netflix so there were a number of films and documentaries available to watch. ‘The Last Dance’ about Michael Jordan, the basketball giant was an intriguing insight of what make a champion. I had been making a habit before the pandemic of trying to pick up a variety of books from charity shops, charity tables in supermarkets, library book sales etc., to try out different authors and genres. So in addition to the likes of Robert Harris, Mick Herron, Ursula le Guin, Anita Brookner etc., I also took on some political history with Peter Hennesey, Bob Woodward and Nick Davies there were also books by Daniel Berrigan, Sven Birketts and Gabriel Kolko requiring a lot of thought. A lot more attention was paid to the garden as I had more time and this looked the best it has done for a couple of years. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? For me this is of considerable interest as I am one of those people who do not understand why you should downgrade this aspect of life just because just because you are at home for any length of time. My father was in the navy during WWII and imparted aspects of his naval training to me. So, shoes were cleaned every night before work next day, your clothing was always hung up correctly at the end of each day irrespective of what time or state one arrived home! I was also expected to shave and bath/shower regularly. I even still get out of bed at the same time that I did when working full time, 6:30am. This routine continues today. I shower, wash my hair and shave on a daily basis. Apart from trousers and sweaters, whatever else I wear is changed daily. You have to maintain some standards in life to maintain integrity. At my age there is also the need to avoid what I call the care home fashion of tracksuit trousers and slippers. Sorry, that sounds very politically incorrect but results from visits to my in-laws in care homes in the past, this seemed to be the uniform. I suspect that I am generalising but it is a look that I wish to avoid as I am sure that it increases the ageing process. I remember some years ago, when my then very young son passed Chickenpox onto me and at that time I was off work for nearly six weeks. At that time, yes standards slipped because I was Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services unable to shave etc., and too weak to get out of bed for about a week. However, I think that there comes a point where if you do not make an effort, the decline will never be overcome. I am very conscious that this all makes me sound very pompous and have no intention of being so but part of me is actually being clean and smart. Like many people, I would really like to have my hair cut. I am beginning to look like my 15 year old Beatle cut but on steroids!! Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I have osteo-arthritis and am in chronic pain. Not hammer on thumb pain but a body that aches permanently. At the onset, I was waking up five or six times a night and was prescribed Amitryptilyne, a mild anti-depressant relax me during the night. Thus there has been nothing unusual about my sleep patter throughout lock-down. However, a side effect for me of the drug is very vivid dreams, usually of activities or scenes from my past but with additional people appearing. It is like watching a video of one’s past being rerun. It usually wakes me, I calm down and go back to sleep with no recurrence of the dream. I wonder if the insomnia and nightmare that some have experienced is due to not maintaining their normal routine as if going to work. Certainly, when I stopped my office based work, I had similar problems but found it all settled when I went back to a ‘normal routine’. It does mean any plans to have a lie-in go by the board though!"

Therefore, I have just answered most of these points very briefly and in some places made references to that diary. Health: As far as we know, none of us in the house (myself, my wife A, my daughter S and my son, who turned 13 during the lockdown) have had Covid-19 although we have had viruses and colds, so possibly we have had it mildly and fairly asymptomatically. The lockdown has been stressful but it is a mixed experience and some days I am fine and some I feel more anxious – the anxiety is not so much about getting the virus (although that was certainly part of the anxiety at the beginning of the lockdown) as to what lies in the future. There are two main strands to this. One is that I work in London and therefore have a long weekly commute which I hate and I would like to give up my job and in some way the virus presents the opportunity to do this (especially as I turned 55 in May and can now take my pension) while at the same time causing anxiety as to how, if I go on, I will handle the commute if and when my university campus reopens. In other words, the pandemic has brought to a head an important decision I have been thinking about for several years and that is stressful and has generated some tension between A and myself. There was a week in which I couldn’t sleep and in the end I rang up the ‘Employee Assistance Programme’ of my university which is outsourced to a firm called Carefirst (see my ‘coronavirus diary 15.5.2020, pp.99-100). The call helped me identify that the problem was anxiety as I have described it in the sentences above. We discussed breathing exercises and so forth. I’m still experiencing difficulties in sleeping and some anxiety but because I know what it is, it is easier to deal with it, not to panic and just accept it as part of the uncertainty of the times. A has also used the same service through her own university and has had counselling through them by phone every week – today was the last session. A feels trapped in a small town in the corner of West wales. Normally she would go to London once or twice a month and to Berlin once a month (where she has a flat). Now she is stuck here and follows travel news continuously hoping for lifting off the lockdown (there is still a five-mile limit on travel her in wales as I write on 2nd July) so that she can feel as though she can go somewhere. This means we are in different places with respect to the lockdown as I would be quite happy for it to continue (it is easy to walk to the sea and up into the country from our house; we have a big garden etc.) and she is desperate for it to end. I don’t want to be able to travel to work in London; she is desperate to get to Germany and outside Aberystwyth more generally. But actually we have dealt with this discrepancy fairly well on the whole by just talking regularly/continuously because it is a discrepancy that we have had to deal with for nearly twenty years during which I have been commuting to various other parts of the country to work and she has been working in the location where we live. Throughout that time, she has seen my desire to get a job at home so that I can live at home as effectively creating a limitation on her own freedom to move jobs because then we would be stuck in that particular town. To be honest, if I had ever managed to get a job in the town where we lived, I think we would have been happy enough but that hasn’t happened and so there is ongoing issue about movement/location that this crisis has highlighted. Under other circumstances, I might have enjoyed the lockdown more as , for example, a few years ago when the combination of the lecturer’s strike and heavy snow meant that I spent four weeks at home. But that period didn’t coincide with or raise any bigger existential questions. And obviously, part of the tension of the current situation is the enforced staying at home apart from exercise. Only in the last couple of weeks have any shops been open other than supermarkets. Since mid-march, we have only been out of Aberystwyth five times and three of those trips were for medical appointments (eye appointments for A, which would normally take place in Aberystwyth but which have been moved to Aberaeron as part of the changes the health service has made to deal with consequences of the pandemic – see ‘coronavirus diary’, 3.4.20, p.24, 1.6.20, p.110, 22.6.20, p.125. It’s not surprising that the circumstances put pressure on people. Also, suddenly one becomes very self-aware of the slightest variations in atmospheric weather (any period of humidity is like suddenly bearing the weight of the world) and bodily feeling. Our son has also had his ups and downs and missed his sport (normally a lot of his time outside school would be taken up with his football and basketball clubs) and so we have played games, I have done basketball practice with him (we have a hoop) and got him out on walks and bike rides. He has literally become a teenager during this lockdown and entered puberty with spots and voice breaking etc and so he is more hormonal than he was. Over the last few days he has had problems with a spot on his leg which burst and then would not heal. This morning we rang the NHS hotline and then on their advice engaged with our doctor, filled out an online form and sent photos of the ‘wound’. Then there was a telephone consultation and antibiotics were prescribed, which I picked up in the late afternoon from the pharmacy. At the pharmacy they denied that they had my son’s details and claimed only three people were registered for our address but that was clearly because he has never had a prescription before. Our surgery had clearly not sent over the prescription but I went and talked to them through their intercom system (the surgery is next door to the pharmacy) and they came out and gave me the prescription and so I was able to take it into the pharmacy and get it. The Government: For a start, there is more than one government involved. In Wales we have a Welsh Government and one of the stories of the lockdown is how the Welsh Government have diverged from the Westminster Government. Also, the Northern Ireland and Scottish Governments have acted differently. To be blunt, devolved government has saved lives in those countries because the UK Government have behaved with reckless and culpable neglect and should in my view be held as legally culpable for tens of thousands of deaths, especially those in care homes. I’ve written about this extensively in my diary (too frequently to cite) but there were a number of missed opportunities for action, which I’ve summarised very broadly here: 1. In late January and early February, when it first became apparent that Covid-19 was going to become a problem in Europe, Johnson was preoccupied with leaving the EU and then having celebrated leaving the EU and shuffling the cabinet into his own mould, he went on holiday for over a week. A lot of preparations could have been inaugurated in this period and the later shortages of PPE averted. The capacity of the Health Service has been undermined by ten years of austerity government but there was time for some urgent remedial action. The stock of PPE, lurking in a private warehouse in Greater Merseyside, could have been readied and updated. The national pandemic plan, which assumed flu, could have been updated. Instead nothing really happened for five weeks until early March, other than the decision to set up the Nightingale hospitals, which in itself was an indicator that the UK Government had decided that it was going to let the virus rip through Britih society and run up hundreds of thousands of fatalities. 2. On Thursday 12 March (the day after I travelled back from work in London for the last time) Johnson told the nation ‘I must level with you, level with the British public – more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time’. As I have said in my diary (see 24.5.20, pp. 110-111), I don’t think it is impossible that we will see this statement dissected in court (at least in an inquiry even if not a prosecution case). It is clear that the Johnson Government were pursuing a ‘herd immunity’ policy at the time but the effect of that speech was to trigger the beginning of an informal lockdown: for example, my university announced the day after that it was closing our campus from the following Monday. Over the weekend between, the Government accepted that there would have to be a lockdown but they didn’t implement this until over a week later on the evening of Monday 23 March. By which time, according to the Sunday Times Insight Team report of 24.5.20, probably 1.5M British people were infected. If the Government had started the lockdown from Friday 13 March, maybe over 30,000 lives would have been saved. Also, in mid March, thousands of patients were sent ‘home’ from NHS hospitals, often to care homes; another decision with disastrous consequences. 3. The UK Government started easing lockdown too soon but the key event was the Dominic Cummings Affair, in which he flagrantly broke the lockdown rules by driving to Durham with his family while infected. He then drove his wife to a beauty spot on her birthday in order to ‘test his eyesight’. Instead, of sacking him, Johnson allowed him to give a press conference in the rose garden of 10 Downing Street on Sunday 24 May in which he came out with all this nonsense. These events effectively put paid to the Government’s authority to make people obey the virus restrictions, which have mostly been lifted now and the 2m gap has been reduced. That many people in England think that it is all over is demonstrated by the scenes from beaches around England last week in the mini heatwave. But, the virus is still circulating, albeit at a much reduced level. Whereas, countries such as New Zealand and, closer to home, Scotland, are seeking to eliminate it completely, it is being allowed to circulate in England and therefore it can flare up again (as in Leicester). As a policy, this is the equivalent of touching wood and saying ‘hopefully, it will be ok’. I take it as confirmation that the UK Government’s thinking is that a second wave is inevitable and somehow desirable in a herd immunity sense. This is a political decision and it has potentially scary and fatal consequences. To summarise, there have been bad decisions made for a variety of reasons – including carelessness and inattention – which have led to maybe more than 60,000 deaths: the ONS record over 55,000 deaths in the UK with Covid on the death certificate but there are many more ‘excess’ deaths, which may well have been due to it. I no longer recognise the legitimacy of this government. That sounds melodramatic and the sort of thing a life-long anti-Tory might say but this is different to the past. I didn’t like the Cameron government but I thought of them as the UK Government and I even had some respect for the hapless may regime as Government; whereas the current administration are a shower of crooks. We should be building organised resistance, which in the devolved countries would take the shape of independence. Going forward, I think the UK Government will try and surf the wave of the virus in order to reshape political reality. For example, it is abundantly clear that there will now be a full scale assault on the universities and the humanities in particular, that university places will be reduced and FE/apprenticeships put in their place. It’s a culture war. At the same time, the Government are going to try and roll back trans rights, which will in effect be an attack on everyone’s capacity to express their gender and sexuality (see my replies to part one of this directive on gender). I don’t think this was the original plan. Well, I think the government was planning to do these things but they didn’t immediately perceive the virus as creating the opportunity to push through these changes faster. Originally, it caught them by surprise despite the fact that we had time to see what was happening in China, South Korea and then Italy. Then the Government tried to make it into a national celebration of ‘we’re all in this together’ Britishness but that was undermined by the fatality rate and the Cummings Affair, and so now they have just gone full ideological. They will prioritise getting the economy going, all kids back in school in September, and pushing through a Brexit trade deal or a no-deal exit. It’s touch and go which but I still think there will be a basic negotiated agreement because the ‘sabre-rattling’ on both sides sounds as though it is designed to support negotiating positions rather than anything else. But if it is a no-deal Brexit, then there will be economic pandemonium and shortages, and Scotland and Northern Ireland will go. Welsh support for independence, currently at 25%, will also jump. Nothing will happen with respect to the virus unless it spikes. I don’t want it too but it seems wishful thinking that it won’t once everything has been reopened in England (including pubs for this coming weekend). I think the UK Government are planning for the second wave in the autumn but whether they will be able to get people to voluntarily lockdown again is difficult to gage. I think the governments of Scotland and Wales have a much better chance because they still have the support of their publics who are aghast watching what is happening in England. I think the UK Government, will if necessarily exert more power including curfews and even martial law, if that is the only way they can impose lockdowns. There is also the possibility that emergency powers could be used to curtail the powers of the devolved administrations and also to manage a no-deal Brexit. I doubt that the Government are actually planning to do this but it is easy to see circumstances aligning so that this could happen. However, that kind of emergency might also lead to a National Government or even civil disorder so it is probably not the favoured option of even someone like Cummings. But the fact that Mark Sedwill, the Civil Service Cabinet Secretary, has been forced out by the Government doesn’t bode well. Eyes will also be on the US, where the infection rate has spiked again to the point that more than 50,000 new infections a day are appearing. That is out of control and the number will go up because the states concerned have only just begun reversing the opening-up measures. If it gets up to 100,000 day it could effectively mean civil collapse. Trump could then try and use martial law to cling on to power because at the moment it looks from the polls that Biden will win the presidential election in November. What happens in the US could effect what happens here. On the whole, the example is likely to be so bad that I think the majority of British people will want to avoid that, so I think therefore that the UK government won’t try and engineer this in the way that Trump government possibly have. But I still think we all need to cross our fingers because the situation is not fully under control. Democracy as we have known it is no longer operational in the US and England. News: I’m reading the Guardian, the New York Times and the Financial Times, plus other media sources accessed through social media. I have not watched any of the Government daily broadcasts (which were discontinued last week) but caught up on announcements via the Guardian’s live blog. I have not watched the BBC at all or indeed, any TV coverage, with the exceptions of some clips from twitter. Work and home life: Yes, both I and A are working for our respective universities. That has been quite hard but then it always is hard and time consuming. Most marking and administration tasks have been online for some years and so it is easy and in some ways it is also easier to arrange meetings online because it doesn’t depend on who is on campus on what particular day. In some ways, it is the same but without the nightmare 14 hour weekly return commute. It has impacted home life because we are at home all the time and this does require more cleaning, cooking, washing up etc because we are not eating lunches out of the home. Things wear out. We had to have a plumber in for the downstairs toilet. I had to repair the curtain rail. I’ve had to buy a new laptop. We have been schooling but at 13, my son is fairly self-directed and while I have helped him with maths in particular, he often gets on with his work himself and it is more a question of talking to him about it. Obviously, we are fortunate not to have small children anymore. Therefore, we don’t have issues with who should be working when or arguments about that. Like most people, though, we would like it to end… Technology: I’ve used zoom a lot because my university has bought a license and so we can use its full functionality. But otherwise, I work online a lot anyway and have a laptop, tablet and smart phone. I use social media anyway and so I haven’t really changed in that respect. The imminence of the lockdown did lead to me buying a kindle in March and I have used that a lot and bought books through it. I have had a few online social meet ups and we have a met a couple of people in the garden since that has been allowed, but in general there are four of us in the house and so isolation and loneliness are not problems, as they are for many. Shopping and food: I’ve documented my various trips to supermarkets in my diary. In the beginning there were shortages. Everything has long since settled down. We’ve had to do more cooking but we also have bought takeaways throughout the lockdown. Entertainment and Leisure: Well in some ways we haven’t had massively more free time than usual. We have made an effort to play lots of games as a family, especially in the early weeks (we both had a fortnight’s holiday over Easter). We own a lot of board games and have played variously: Alhambra, Carcassonne, Niagara, Dominion, Honshu, Azul, Ticket to Ride, Small Worlds, Talisman and some others. I’ve also played a lot of Magic the Gathering (MtG) with my son and daughter. I have exercise every day apart from a couple of times I was feeling really ill or tired. I’ve walked out a lot along the seafront or up Constitution Hill and into the fields beyond. We also bought an exercise bike just before the lockdown and I road that a lot at the start and more infrequently since because if it’s nice I’d rather get outside. I’ve lost weight – well, I did initially and I have stabilised again but I’m definitely fitter than I was before the lockdown. A and I have been ploughing through The Crown on Netflix, and have now finally nearly finished the third season (at a rate on one or two episodes a week). We have watched some of the National Theatre youtube screenings (on our TV): A Servant of Two Guvnors, Treasure Island, Frankenstein, Small Island and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (which was excellent but they have all been very good). I have read a lot but I always do read a lot. I’m currently reading ion my kindle a non-fiction book, Female Husbands by Jen Manion. But I’ve read getting on for 20 novels and about half a dozen non-fiction books overall since the lockdown began. Some topically related: as a result of BLM, I read Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race. Personal hygiene: possibly not shaving as much as usual but I’ve gone from a full beard to a goatee and so I wasn’t shaving that much before. Sleep: This has been the area in which I have been having difficulties in getting to sleep and sometimes lying awake in the middle of the night. As discussed above, I try and relax and breathe deeply but above all not panic because I am not getting to sleep. It varies and on the whole I think I’m getting enough although on some days I feel tired. Ultimately, I don’t think there is a solution until we are out of the anxiety-inducing situation and therefore I expect the problem to continue at least into the autumn."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. I am generally quite healthy as long as I take my Warfarin tablets and use my inhaler for asthma each night. We were self isolating for 20 days due to having Covid symptoms and I found that difficult as I am used to going out somewhere most days. After the 20 days it felt strange to go out again and I noticed how different the world had become with social distancing rules in place. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. Apart from having a Covid test I did not need any help. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I have found it difficult being with wifey the who time. Normally one of us is often away and so I am used to being alone. Wifey can be difficult at times by making things awkward. An instance is she will say she will go the shops next day in the morning for bread. It gets to noon and she still hasn’t gone and when prompted will storm out saying she is so busy etc etc. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made?  The IOM Gov mirrored the UK government steps but added in extra ones on travel by locking down the borders and not allowing anyone to enter for a few weeks. After a while they started to allow returning Manx people to come back in very limited numbers and made them pay £1,000 to be in two week quarantine in a hotel. Much groaning on their part but it was the correct thing to do. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Hard to say as they seem slow to want to remove the lock downs for fear of a second spike in deaths. They should shut the borders to prevent new cases coming in and should have done that in the first place. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I have generally had to resort to online viewing. It is hard to get an objective view as there are so many conflicting stories and tales. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this?  The Isle of Man Government has been having its own briefings but finding out about these afterwards has been difficult as the full texts don’t seem to be available. The local radio and newspapers are very poor on reporting, principally as they don’t have any proper reporters and so there is little information available. The local newspapers are hard to obtain as few shops are open or shut early. Looking online everything is hidden behind a paywall. The only reliable source of information has proved to be the BBC/ Isle of Man page. It doesn’t have much but it does have the most important stories or info. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I work from home normally with one room set aside as a studio. Work is usually posted to me by clients from the UK or Ireland. Most clients have stopped totally in the jewellery sector but one designer is using the time to update his website and so has needed images. Also the on island Watchmaker Roger Smith is still producing watches and needs some photographed as they are finished. I would estimate that I am probably earning half of what I would normally expect. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with?  How have you managed these challenges? I live with wifey who also works for herself as a copywriter. She has been exceptionally busy, more so than for the last few years as has a couple of new retail type clients both from overseas. Normally we only spend a week or two together before one of us decides to have a break or go on a trip to visit UK relatives so it has been harder being around someone each and every day especially in the twenty days of isolating. It’s like working solidly without a break as you are with the same person all the time. She is stubbornly left wing and thinks Boris Johnson is a fool whereas I think he is probably the right person in the job at the moment. It makes for an easier life for me to sagely nod and not state my opinions. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I’ve not had to learn anything new as have always kept ahead of things and use multiple Apple products throughout the day. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I have at times used FaceTime to talk to my daughters that have young children but I find it difficult as the whole conversation is taken up with the young children needing attention so after half an hour you have found very little out. I’m quite glad to not use this much. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I avoid Facebook if I can but do post on Instagram as it’s a good place to put pics that I have taken. I am very selective about what I put on and about how often I post. Little and not to often is how I use Instagram. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Food shopping is fine but I go less often and tend to buy more at once. The cupboards have never been so well stocked up as the experience of 20 days of isolation showed that you do need variety as well as the basics. Still cannot get any yeast for bread making. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Previously we would have gone out once a week but now everything is home cooked. The queues to get into M&S are so long that it is not worth going there even though they have the widest range of veg and cheeses. I do most of the cooking and have been looking through recipe books to see what is different and interesting with the ingredients available. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? I don’t seem to have a huge amount of spare time what with my own creative work, real work and cooking. However the garden is looking at its best ever and there are now 4 beds for growing veg with a raised bed being made at the bottom of the garden under an apple tree where the soil is currently poor. I have managed to do some jobs that have needed doing for a long time such as putting a coat of paint on two rusty drain covers in the garden and repairing odd things. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. Haven’t changed much to normal but did watch on Netflix the entire set of Narcos which was interesting as all based on true stories. I have been doing some drawing with pen and ink but was doing that at times anyway. Have also learnt a new ragtime Blind Blake piece on the guitar which will still take a good few weeks to get up to speed. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Nothing much has changed. I last had a haircut in Birmingham on 14 February but it was a very good cut and has grown out well. Maybe I’ll just let it grow and have long hair again which I did have when I was 18. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. I don’t have insomnia but do wake in the night with asthma symptoms and read the news on the phone or something not too challenging. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this?  Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I am still very tired at times from having the Covid virus, it comes in waves and sometimes I have to go to bed early than I would normally which is 11pm.  ends I attach a Covid-19 diary that I kept as events unfolded. Looking back it makes interesting reading as it does describe the way we were unsure and how quickly restrictions were put in place."

I’ll just add a few extra notes: Health: Thankfully, everyone I know has kept pretty well during the past year, apart from a brother whose anxiety & depression has worsened. However, he has sought help for that, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy – and is now back at work. He’s been very open with friends and colleagues about his ill-health, which has resulted in others telling him about their own mental health issues. Physically, though, none of my nearest and dearest have had Covid, though I do know through friends of others who have, ranging in age from mid-30s to 80+. One or two of those have been left with long Covid. The Government:  There have been times when they have handled this ineptly and badly. I eagerly await Dominic Cummings’ thoughts on the matter when he goes before a Parliamentary Select Committee in the next week or so. There is still (May 2021) a lot of uncertainty over what people can and can’t do, where they can and can’t go. However, the big success story is the vaccination programme. None of us can thank the NHS enough for that. News: I’ve very much rationed my news intake over the past year. There were months when Radio 4 in particular was like the scene in the Hitchcock film Blackmail, where a woman keeps hearing the word ‘knife…knife…knife’ in her head. That’s how I felt every time I turned on R4, hence my addiction to Radio 3. We’ve never watched much TV news, which has also been a boon. Our next-door neighbour’s 70-something mother has become more and more anxiety-ridden over this past year, because she’s been devouring the television news 24/7. Her daughter has tried again and again to get her to stop, but she can’t – she’s obsessed with the news, which has had a marked effect on her mental health. Maybe now she’d had the vaccines, she’ll calm down a bit. J7229 As for the Govt Press briefings – I’m afraid most members of the current Government bring me out in hives when I see or hear them, Boris Johnson in particular. So no, I have saved my temper and my sanity by never watching them. Work and home life: I’ve pretty much covered this in my coronavirus diaries. All I can add really is to say that, thankfully, my husband and I have always got on very well, and we make each other laugh a lot. Nonetheless, there have been times when I think he’s mentally slowed down – he’s become terrible at remembering names, for example, and gets facts wrong when retelling stories. That’s made me very impatient at times, as we’ve been together pretty much all day, every day. But he still makes me laugh – sometimes in the middle of my impatience – so the irritation has been nothing compared to what many others must have suffered over this past year. I’ve often wondered how working couples ­whose daily lives used to involve seeing each other only first thing in the morning and then in the evenings – have fared this past year. Two sets of neighbours are in that situation, both with two young children to home-school at times as well. But they all seem to have survived. Technology: Again, I covered this pretty extensively in my coronavirus diaries. Shopping & cooking: Ditto. I reckon we’ve eaten much better than usual, as I’ve been at home to make soups for lunch, and evening meals from scratch. But it also means we’ve eaten too much – and definitely drunk more than we did pre-pandemic. Entertainment & leisure: All I can add here is that I’ve started (but not finished) an online Introduction to Classical Music course. I want to take that up again, as it was interesting and useful. At one point, thanks to a book I’d bought – Year of Wonder, by Clemency Burton-Hill – I was listening to a particular recommended piece of music each day, but that’s gone by the board. I need to start that up again now, too. We’ve had almost daily walks as exercise, together with my regular Zoom sessions of yoga and Mindfulness (the latter including mindful movement). What else have I read? Various Moomin stories from the wonderful Tove Jansson – I only discovered them a couple of years ago, and they’ve been a great boon during the pandemic, with their messages of resilience, kindness, compassion and humour. Also Tove Jansson’s letters, and now her biography. Also The Time Traveller’s Guide to Regency Britain, by Ian Mortimer. I’ve read all his previous TT guides, too, and find them wonderful in the way they take you back in time, and bring previous eras alive. Again, there’s a lot to be said for being able to put the pandemic into a historical perspective, and learn about the hardships our ancestors would have encountered, and how they dealt with them (or not). J7229 Personal hygiene: This hasn’t changed. I’ve made a determined effort not to let standards slip. OK, I’m no longer standing in front of a lecture-or seminar-room full of students, but that’s no reason not to put on an Indian salwar kameez-inspired outfit, or a Gudrun Sjoden Swedish-influenced dress with bright leggings. Plus matching/mismatching earrings, necklace, ankle socks, scarves, whatever. I may not photograph myself in my ‘outfit of the day’ and post it on Facebook/WhatsApp like my sister-in-law does, but I still like to make the effort… Sleep: There have been nights of disrupted sleep, particularly early on in the pandemic. And yes, very vivid dreams, though I’m hard put to remember any of those now. But they were quite hallucinogenic in their colours, over-population of people, swirls of conflicting and overlapping events. My husband’s had them, too, as have other people I know – and have read about in the newspapers. I get them during my afternoon naps, too – where I’ve also discovered, much to my horror, that I sleep with my mouth open, so it feels revolting when I wake up, disorientated. As for what I do when I can’t sleep – usually, I’ll get up, make myself a cup of tea and a slice of bread and butter, read a bit of Agatha Christie, then go back to bed. Or I’ll stick my iPod on and listen to the hypnotic voice of my Mindfulness teacher reciting the 25-minute breathing meditation, and that almost inevitably puts me to sleep. That’s why I call it Beditation. ENDS"

UPDATE SECTION: Health Nothing, apart from catching the coronavirus, and experiencing tiredness for a couple of weeks. I had a mild bout and live to describe it. I did not require medical assistance. I embarked on walking up the stairs to equal Everest. At first I was very tired but later I could easily fit in 600 feet or 1,000 feet while tea brewed. To date, I have passed Kilimajaro and am now ticking off peaks in the Himalayas.  I am in a fortunate position. I have hobbies, a garden, e-mails and the weather has been good. I have found it different but in a curious way it has not been unenjoyable. Knowing that everyone else is in the same position has made a difference. But my family and friends have been well upto now and that has been important. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? It was an impossible position. Without knowledge of the disease, whether people could be infected but not show symptoms, whether it could be passed on by those not showing symptoms, how it was transmitted, what proportion of cases would be mild, or serious, or fatal, it was fightingin the dark. The government did its best. There will have to be serious discussion of the policies and timing – but not yet. It is no use comparing the UK with other countries as different countries collect data in different ways. Only the excess deaths with illuminate the overall picture. It will be important to learn lessons as this may not be the last pandemic. It is always possible that this will be a rehearsal for future pandemics. What steps do you think the British government will make in the coming months? It is difficult to predict as their ideal will probably not coincide with practical necessity. The R number may rise if the lock-down is relaxed.  Also the population may be very cautious, whatever they are formally allowed to do. But there will be a need to get people back to work in some way. The daily updates Yes, I have been watching this daily. I do not watch the rolling news. I have the 6pm new on, but tend to be busy doing other things.  I like experts being present to comment and answer questions. I am glad the pool of questioners has been widened. I do not know anyone who has had difficulty accessing the news. I have seen the Scottish use of a BSL interpreter. It is a good idea. It made me want to go and find out more, but the library is shut. Work and home life. I am retired so have been in a fortunate position. One child is working from his home, one is on a hospital front-line and one is working as usual. The son who is working from home, and his wife, who is working from home, are also home schooling. I wish I could go and run the home schooling, but that is impossible. Technology I have probably been exchanging e-mails with friends more frequently. But I haven’t seen them. I do not use Zoom, Facebook and all these other modern methods. Neither do I shop on-line. People occasionally recommend You Tube items on random subjects. I do not use such methods to access news. Shopping I continue to shop in the village, once weekly for milk and once for everything else. It is slightly limiting but it is adequate. Flour has not come back onto the shelves. I would have purchased some rice if I had foreseen the lock-down. But there are plenty of potatoes. My eating habits have not changed. I am pleased that seasonal vegetables and fruit are available. I have tried a few new things. In honour of the VE Day commemoration I have read through my file of wartime recipes and have been doing a tried and tested recipe each day. Yesterday I included homemade fish cakes. Tomorrow I will include Woolton Pie. I will have to use a wartime pastry recipe, including potato, as I am using flour sparingly. Entertainment and Leisure I find I have time to think about my embroidery projects as I am not distracted by other tasks. As I both design and execute these I am making better progress than in normal times. I have done spring cleaning, which is not usually top of the daily agenda. I am making a wholecloth quilt. This is a new project which I would not have attempted without the lock down. I planned to try making dipped candles but I have not yet had time. I have made some cards to try tablet braiding. But I need to do more spring cleaning to find two colours of wool. What have I been watching or listening to? I am a creature of habit. I have kept a diary of the best each day so I can tell you, to date. I regret that broadcasts has mainly consisted of repeats. I have watched the Coronavirus Update daily, but have not always noted this. I have half watched some programmes, while doing another task at the same time.

But my hair is now much shorter, as I was due to go to the hairdresser when lock-down started and have used a hair clipper on longest setting. Fortunately my hair is not dyed or permed. Sleep I have experienced no problems sleeping. I am active during the day, get up at a set time, go to bed at a set time and read in bed for a set time ( unless I am at the end of an excellent book ). The village has been very quiet, which has been excellent. There has been a curfew, as an accidental consequence of the lock-down. Dreams I am afraid I have yet to remember any dreams, ever."

I feel sanguine but slightly apprehensive about the future, realising that this is the worst thing to happen so far in my lifetime and its consequences could be far reaching. The Government They came to power on a wave of spurious personality and a catchphrase; and their shallowness is now apparent. Whatever they do will be for their own ends and not for the people. News I watch the TV news, listen to radio and follow news online. The daily government broadcasts follow the pattern of: a trenchant question which is answered by a minister saying that this is incredibly important and that we are doing our utmost, straining every cliché and the Prime Minister is at the helm, even though he is largely absent. The question is seldom answered. I don’t know anybody with challenges, but a sign language person would acknowledge that there are people out there who need this. Work and home life Life has not been vastly different. I lost my office last year, so am at home anyway. I have been reading a great deal, cooking, baking and going for walks. I was going to get married, but that has been postponed. There was a possibility of a minimalist wedding, but the churches are closed, we cannot have the banns read, nor can we have a gathering of five people (priest, couple and two witnesses). We had both had outfits made and had made great plans for our families to come and for us to honeymoon in a grand loch-side house in Scotland. We may still have the minimalist wedding at some point and a blessing service with all the guests maybe next year. We have re-arranged the Scottish trip for a year’s time. I have been living with my partner for two years, so we are used to being together. She occasionally has bouts of stress behaviour. One day I was severely reprimanded for: bringing a morsel of grass into the kitchen on my shoes; for asking if there was anything she particularly wanted me to do that day; and for making a phone call. The call was because the district council phoned and asked if the museum that I manage would like £10,000. I thought our treasurer ought to know about this, so I called him. Technology I haven’t learned any new stuff. Some of the Freemasons set up a Zoom session, but I knew it was not the sort of thing in which I would function, so I didn’t take part. I have used Facebook and Twitter quite a lot. I put a piece of film on Facebook to show what the public would have seen if the museum had still been open; and also sent it to BBC Look East and Museums From Home. I also made a short film about Dickens for the 200th anniversary of his birth. If I see eye-opening articles from The Guardian showing the government’s incompetence or chicanery, I share them on Facebook. Right wingers share stuff saying how awful it is when the press doesn’t support our government who are doing their best under extreme pressure. In the USA Trump has the same attitude to ‘fake news’, while Bolsanaro in Brazil says, “So what?” Shopping and Food My fiancée has had some difficulty getting slots online for grocery deliveries, so we have had to go shopping or collect things a couple of times. But, generally, we have had few problems. Eating and cooking habits have stayed much the same, although we have been a bit more frugal, to make food last longer. Entertainment and Leisure I never had television; but, now that I am with my fiancée, I have to watch it each night. I take an interest in Dragon’s Den, because I have never had a clue about money, The Apprentice and Who Dares Wins – all of which are far from my experience. I realise that they are much more scripted, rehearsed, re-taken and edited to make good television, than most people would know. But they have a grim fascination. The values shown are very worldly – money, gain, beating others, using presentation to succeed. Who Dares Wins inverts the process of positivity and encouragement to mould people, preferring foul-mouthed abuse and humiliation. I doubt I would ever have had the strength and stamina to take part in something like that; but I think I could cope with the fear situations. The ‘staff’ don’t want anyone to be harmed; so crossing a precipice on a rope must be safe and possible, if you use your powers of reason. My reading has included: David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, the Squeers and Crummles sections of Nicholas Nickleby, the American scenes in Martin Chuzzlewit, parts of American Notes (including looking up things online that Dickens cites in newspapers), three Dickens biographies, long Byron poems Manfred and Childe Harold, a book about John Buchan and The 39 Steps, a chapter about working men in WW1 in Facing Armageddon, Great Britain by Ian Jack, The Great War & Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, Albion by Peter Ackroyd, A Bridge Too Far by Cornelius Ryan, a book about SAS hero Blair Mayne, parts of Buchan’s Greenmantle, Adventures in the Screen Trade by William Goldman, Solzhenitsyn’s August 1914. I have collated articles I have written over the years for a book about local history and my museum projects inspired by characters and events. On my walks I learn Masonic ritual. In September 2022 I will be Worshipful Master of a Mark Masons Lodge, having already been one in a Craft Lodge. But in Mark they don’t have Lodges of Instruction, where you rehearse what you will be doing next year. Instead you have just one rehearsal and then you are on, with much to recite. So I am imprinting it in my sub-conscious now. Personal Hygiene No change. Sleep I sometimes get poked by my partner for making steam engine noises when lying on my back. So I have tried going to sleep on my right side instead of my left, as I seem less likely to roll onto my back if I do that. Otherwise not much change. I often have loving experiences in dreams, with women I have never met."

Although I feel fortunate that we are only a small family of 3; however, I feel it has been particularly hard for my daughter (aged 6) who has been off school (up until this week-01/06/20), being an only child I think she has been lonely and isolated from other children. She has written her local friends many letters and drawn pictures etc, which we have posted through letterboxes. Health: We have all remained healthy throughout the weeks/months of lockdown so far. I have felt stressed at times, mainly because of home-schooling my daughter. We have good days and bad days; I imagine like everyone who is living through this uncertain time. We have not required any medical help so far. My partner and I both have acknowledged that we both feel more tired and drained than normal, although this could be because of the lighter mornings that we are having since the clock change going forward. The Government: I feel that the Government should have acted quicker in their initial response to Coronavirus. I don’t think we were taking it seriously enough and that we should have locked down sooner than when we did, which may have helped lessen the spread. Having said that, the Government have faced an enormous challenge, one which would have been trying for whoever was in power at the time. I am a little unsure of some of the steps they have taken with regards to easing the lockdown, especially where you are now able to travel anywhere in the UK. Living in the South-West we have seen an influx of tourists at our beaches who have been tightly packed in and possibly not sticking to the social distancing. There have been accidents (including fatal) as there are no coastguards present. This has made locals extremely uneasy; I do feel that people should try to remain in their county, rather than be able to travel further distances. Public conveniences have remained closed at this time which has also resulted in masses of litter (including human waste, used nappies etc) being dumped at our beaches and beauty spots. It makes me question whether people are using their brains! I am not entirely sure which steps the Government will take next; I think they might try to get the remaining years groups for Primary Schools back into the classroom before the start of the summer holidays. It remains difficult to know who to trust, including the Government as this has been completely new territory for everyone, there is a feeling of let’s see if this works, with regard to easing of restrictions, I have felt like my child may possibly being used as a guinea pig in an experiment. On top of this you have the scientists who are saying that it is too soon to ease restrictions, although the economy of the country is also at stake. News: I use the BBC News app on my mobile phone daily, to check any updates throughout the day. I also sometimes listen to the daily coronavirus briefing from the Government sometimes, when the outbreak first occurred, I used to watch this everyday but as time has gone on, I have become less wanting to hear more depressing news. I also watch the news when I can, again, I don’t do this every day. Work and home life: I was furloughed from my job in a non-essential shop very quickly after lock-down had begun. The family run company I work for was very organised in sorting this out as quickly as possible. It made me feel reassured that I was going to be getting some income during this time, especially as so many people were losing their jobs all over the country and the world. My partner works from home and I am normally at home quite a bit of the time so it hasn’t really impacted as much as it would for some families. The only real difference it has made to us is that our daughter has been at home whilst her school has been closed. Her school has been brilliant and provided the parents with plenty of resources in order to home school as effectively as possible. Her teachers have also kept in regular contact with us, which has been really helpful. I have managed to home-school quite well; we have good days and bad days! Generally, we achieve the majority of the work which we are set to do and have kept up with reading etc. We have definitely been more stressed as a family and have certainly argued more, especially when we were cooped up indoors and only allowed out once a day. Technology: My daughter and I have both been using Zoom for the first time during the crisis to keep in contact with friends. I have had a weekly catch up in the evening with a couple of friends and my daughter has had Zoom meetings with a few of her class friends. I have been using Facebook quite a lot, not to post myself but to keep updated with what’s going on. I have also joined a village Facebook page which was set up specifically to help people within our community keep in contact etc. Shopping and food: I normally would do our weekly shop online and have it delivered. I also pre-book slots in advance, which is what I did just before lockdown occurred, which meant that during the first few weeks of the lockdown we were still having our food shop delivered. The big supermarket chains had to reserve the delivery slots for the most vulnerable and those who were self-isolating which meant that slots were not pre-released until a certain time of day and even then there would only be a limited amount of slots as they didn’t have enough vans/drivers to accommodate the demand. Everyone in the beginning wanted their food delivered! Once our slots had run out, we decided to go to the supermarket once a week instead, we go early in the morning when it is quieter and have not found it too bad. The store is all marked out in a one-way system, with 2 metre distancing markers in place, all in all it seems to work well. Although there is always the odd person who wants to get in front as they only want 1 thing or people who say, ‘go around me’, which you are not supposed to do. Some people, especially older, go the wrong way etc, but you have to deal with it the best way you can. I try to avoid going to any other shops if I can, if I really need something, I can go to our local community shop which has a very good policy of 1 person at a time. I have also used a local eco-store for things like cereal, pasta, flour etc as they do not used plastic packaging and they will also deliver to your door. I just email them with a list of what I want, and I pay online. I would say that our eating/cooking habits have remained the same, although I think we have been consuming more over the last few weeks, partly I think from something to do and boredom and to cheer yourself up. I have bought more ‘treat’ snack items than normal. Our alcohol consumption has stayed quite low, maybe a bottle of wine a week or so. Entertainment and Leisure: Along with home-schooling I have done more crafty activities whilst being at home. Painting pictures with my daughter, making things for school projects. We have painted some pebbles which have joined a Covid Caterpillar down on the path of our Church. We started to do some exercise online with Joe Wicks, but that soon fizzled out. We have walked most days, averaging 3 miles or so and have recently visited other places to walk within a 20-mile radius or so, but only once a week. The rest of the time we stay very local with our walks, so we don’t need to use the cars or travel too far. I certainly wouldn’t visit the beach anytime soon, the amount of people turning up from further afield frightens me. I have just listened to the local news today (05/06/20) which is saying that the ‘R’ number – the reproduction number has gone up in the South West to 1. I have been looking after my garden and been growing a tomato and French bean plants, I have also ordered garden waste collection bags from the council so that I don’t have to go to the tip anytime soon. The weather has been fairly warm lately, so we have pumped the paddling pool up for our daughter and we have also been taking out learning to ride her bike. I have been watching programmes and podcasts on history and art (my passions) it is the 500th anniversary of the field of cloth of gold this year. I have taken part in an online murder-mystery event, which was great. I have been reading as much as I can too, I have just finished a book called, the five people you meet in heaven by Mitch Albom, which has been very inspiring and comforting during these dark days. Personal hygiene: Our personal hygiene has not changed at all during this time. My partner and I shower once a day, every day. My daughter has regular baths on the days she has been at school. I would like to get my hair cut though; I haven’t had it cut since November. It may be a while longer before that will be possible. Sleep: I feel very tired at times, because my daughter has been at home, I am tending to go to bed later as I don’t get much time to myself during the day when she is around, so I try to read, watch tv etc when she has gone to bed. My partner and I have also been waking up early too, which hasn’t helped."

However, I will keep things (mercifully) brief. My own physical and mental health has remained fairly consistent throughout the lockdown -I believe -but my mother has had a tumultuous time. She was placed on a new dose of medication in March which immediately didn’t agree with her but because I could only get doctors and other healthcare professionals to respond with telephone consultations, they couldn’t really examine my mother sufficiently and therefore the problem wasn’t resolved until she went into hospital for a few days in July. My mother had endured physical pain and mental health issues that were stressful for us both. Thankfully, she is on the mend now and is hopefully closer to getting an operation that will further help her. The Government In the early days of the lockdown, I followed the news a lot – I didn’t really have much choice as I am a carer for my mother and she loves watching the TV news channels. However, we both began to tire of the television coverage after weeks of hearing the same information repeated so often and the overly zealous examination of every aspect of the pandemic. So, I can’t say that I kept track of everything the government did although they must have been doing something right (arguably) because the amount of Covid cases began to dwindle eventually and life gradually started to return to normal. Even with the best of efforts, the fact that there would be a second wave always seemed fairly inevitable to me. I actually think the virus might be here to stay. We can’t hide forever and sooner or later people will unintentionally slacken their vigilance anyway or get so sick of being restricted that they just throw caution to the wind and do whatever they want. After that, it becomes a matter of luck as to who survives. It’s frightening, but, unless a vaccine is effective, or lockdowns work, I think we’re just going to have to face reality and get back to getting on with our lives. I’m hoping that the government is incorporating the strategies of other countries which have successfully got rid of the coronavirus to help us do the same and speed up the process. News N5744 As I wrote before, I initially watched television to keep up with the latest developments regarding the pandemic, now I just get quick updates via the internet on my Samsung tablet. I have plenty of other things to be doing instead. As for the idea of including a British Sign Language Interpreter during government briefings, I think it makes perfect sense and I am actually surprised that this hasn’t become standard practice long ago. Work and home life Due to working from home anyway, the pandemic has not made a massive difference to my daily routine in that respect. However, it was nice to be able to break up the day by going shopping. My mother and I still have the time to visit our local stores but would need to use a bus or taxi to make it worthwhile for us to go further afield, as she has to be back home for her medication every two and a half hours. We dare not risk using public transport now though because of the coronavirus, especially as the disease is so prevalent in our region at this time. Technology I have a mixed attitude to technology especially in regards to accessing social media. I love things like Facebook and Reddit but feel there is a time and place for them. I think it’s more appropriate to use them in private moments -it can be a nuisance when family and friends are constantly checking their smartphones for messages. I’d not heard of FaceTime, Zoom or HouseParty, but even my Auntie uses WhatsApp now. I’m resisting the pressure to install it. Windows Messenger suffices for keeping in touch with my mates. Instagram has largely passed me by but from what little I’ve heard about it, I doubt I am the target audience. (I couldn’t care less about TikTok either.) I did experiment with Twitter, admittedly just to follow famous people I like, but perhaps unsurprisingly it mostly seems to be a way for these celebrities to promote their latest products, so I soon lost interest. Shopping and food We – my mother and I -used to regularly order groceries online but have somewhat fell out of the habit since the covid crisis when most of the stores were fully booked for deliveries for a long time. Most items remained available to purchase in shops during the pandemic with the exception of toilet rolls and pasta. We used to often eat pasta with curry sauce, before the fusilli became scarce, but we’ve not returned to doing so. I suppose our eating habits have changed slightly since the coronavirus outbreak. It’s largely coincidental as we discovered that my mother’s medication works better if she avoids heavy meals so she eats little but often instead and I try to show solidarity by doing the same. (It doesn’t mean that I don’t miss having a filling evening meal or daydream about eating an Indian takeaway from time to time though.) We have lighter meals – like a jacket potato or soup – but have snacks in between, usually a cup of tea and a biscuit. Entertainment and Leisure I have observed with some envy as people during the lockdown have used the free time forced upon them to try more adventurous cookery recipes, get fit with an exercise regime or take up new N5744 hobbies like painting. As a carer working from home, life plodded on much the same for me for awhile, but I have been inspired by these other people trying new things to at least make the most of what little spare time I do have. I have mainly done this by reading more. In the past I would normally have two or three books on the go at any one time but that number had dwindled to none in recent years. I’m striving to balance what I read between light reading (mostly autobiographies) and more educational subject matter. Following the recent events involving George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, I’ve been endeavouring to learn more about black history via recommended books like Akala’s Natives: Race & Class in the Ruins of Empire and Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging by Afua Hirsch. My mother was in hospital for a few days in July which gave me the chance to catch up on some television programmes and films. I was very impressed with the recent political drama series, Mrs America. I am also glad to have finally got around to checking out Rick and Morty too. The show lives up to the hype as far as I’m concerned – it’s genius (in a twisted sort of way.) I try to squeeze in listening some music that is new to me too. I enjoy watching music reaction videos on YouTube and one of those introduced me to a version of Montana by Frank Zappa from his live album, A Token of His Extreme. Frank Zappa has been on my mental list of music artists that I’ve been meaning to check out for years...and I still don’t think I’m quite ready for him! However, he’s obviously a genius, and I haven’t been this intrigued by what I’ve heard since I discovered Klaus Nomi. Personal Hygiene The temptation to be a slob has been stronger during the quarantine period, especially as I haven’t been venturing out of the house and mixing with people as often, but I’ve pretty much stuck to my regular routine of cleanliness by force of habit. I cut corners in some respects anyway because I generally only shave about once a week. Sleep Insomnia is certainly not an issue for me. It’s staying awake during the day that’s been my problem. I love sleep, and the lack of it in recent years -due to my job -makes me value it even more. Less sleep has meant less dreaming which saddens me as dreams have always been a source of fascination for me. I used to have incredibly colourful and vivid – even lucid – dreams. Now my dreams tend to be murky and have one of two themes – sometimes both at the same time. I dream that I suddenly find myself on holiday in an empty hotel with no understanding of how I got there or I dream that I find myself in rooms at night with the only light dimly coming in through the curtained windows. I believe the symbolism of a dream is unique to the dreamer but I’m not quite sure what my subconscious mind is trying to tell me on these occasions. My mother went through a phase of nightmares during the lockdown but whether they were exacerbated by the restrictions or her medication, I don’t know."

Female. Age 66. Married. Weymouth. Retired Civil Servant. Spring Directive 2020 Part 2. COVID 19 (update). My household of two, this being me & my husband, have not suffered from any health issues of any kind during lockdown, thankfully. I have felt happier than usual although I do worry about the pandemic & also about the terrible racial tension in the U.S.A. I have been content to stay at home, the only thing that I miss is the library. I feel so sorry for the Government. I am sure that they have all been trying desperately to make the wisest decisions but what a maelstrom of advice they have had to wade through. I have never at any time doubted that they all have everyone’s best interests in mind but they cannot help or please everyone all the time. In coming months I expect the restrictions will become more relaxed, more use of face masks to be advised plus a lot more financial responsibility & restrictions to be handed to local government. If social distancing is to be adhered to perhaps they will restrict travel to stop the recent crowding at beaches & beauty spots. I wish they would bring in a mileage limit so people stay in their own areas either by local council boundaries or geographical counties. For the first time in years I have watched some T.V. news, although very little. I always look at teletext news for the U.K. but have also been looking at the world news. I have only seen bits of the daily 5pm updates. I did watch Boris deliver the last of his lockdown changes. I thought he was clear & quite impressive. I don’t think anyone else could have done much better. Oh I definitely think there should be BSL interpreter plus available subtitles on every news broadcast. Absolutely no reason why not. My home life has improved because I have M.S. & I haven’t had to force myself to go anywhere because I think I should. I usually volunteer at a charity shop two mornings a week & very often I only went out of a sense of duty no matter how I was feeling. I am more than happy at home with my solitary pastimes of reading & puzzles. Also my husband is usually out three days a week plus away from home once a month for a 2 or 3 night break. He cannot do this & so I never have to worry about his absences. I usually only keep in touch with two people by ‘phone, I have never wanted to have Skype or FaceTime. All the rest of my friends I correspond with by email or in 2 instances by post. I don’t use any social media. I have been keeping in touch with 3 of my friends from the charity shop by phone but I wouldn’t mind if that stopped really. I stammer badly so the phone can be an ordeal. I have not had any real food problems. I have had fortnightly supermarket deliveries as I had before lockdown. Some things have been hard to get but I have muddled along well. So nothing has changed radically. Every day I spend@ an hour on my cryptic crosswords a little longer on jigsaws. I was buying & selling jigsaws on EBay, usually I buy them from my charity shop. A few weeks ago my shop manager delivered a big bag of jigsaws from the shop for me. They are going to keep me going for months! My reading matter, once I had finished my library books, has been lent to me by my sister in law who has a vast number of books. So no shortage on that score either. Maybe the jigsaws & books haven’t all been what I would have picked out but I am sure the variety is beneficial! I watch many films & some drama series, during lockdown my favourite shows have been The Great British Sewing Bee, Grayson Perry’s Art Club & Keith Lemon’s Craft Factory. I listen to Radio 2 & some Radio 4. The only thing that has changed in my personal hygiene is that my short hair is in dire need of a cut! I am sorely tempted to cut my fringe myself! Luckily I had a very, very brutally short haircut at the beginning of March so it hasn’t been too horrendous for too long plus no-one sees me anyway apart from my husband & he stopped looking at me many years ago! I am a brilliant sleeper! For example yesterday I had 50 minutes after lunch, 20 minutes after dinner, bed at 10.30 where I slept soundly until 7.30! The only thing that has changed a little bit is I have had a couple of nightmares about the pandemic & have once or twice thought that I was ill with it in the night. A sort of half awake dream but all was normal in the morning. Well normal for me! I haven’t been told of any severe cases of insomnia by my friends."

I’m angry at the complacency of the government but not surprised at all and I really hope some of those who voted for them are heavily affected as it will hopefully make some of them think twice about their decisions at the next election, but some people would vote Conservative even if they were made homeless as they would think any other government would somehow put them in a worse position which would almost not even be possible. I’m worried more about dad’s job security than anything and if any good news comes from this I’ll definitely feel some relief and it’ll make me feel a lot more free in my life and emotions if this is the case. I do feel some fear too, fear of our freedoms slowly being taken away and a much longer road to them being recovered – I think it could even be unlikely that some freedoms are not restored within the next 10 years unless protests are in place to help restore them. People power is more important than ever and we cannot let governments control our lives to such a big extent. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? -Everything will be mainly driven by money – it’s a big debate between money and keeping the people on side, but people like money so this is a lot easier than it may seem! If the 14 day quarantine measures for travellers are strictly implemented, it will absolutely crush the airline, tourism and summer job industry to a level not seen before so I do wonder if many other stipulations could come in or it could be amended or loosened to allow some type of tourists in. I think furlough will be increased but reduced, which makes absolutely no sense as for some people it’ll then make more sense to quit their job and try to find one on full pay instead of trying to survive on less income and holding out for better times which may never come as the furlough money could be extended and reduced and then finally the person loses their job which would be such a horrible, but typically capitalist situation to end up in. Figures could also be easily adjusted to fit whatever narrative the government wants as they are almost in control of the ONS and they can choose for them to publish a certain amount of deaths as there’s no way of the public researching about every single death which has taken place. Again, more of this can be found in the other directive so I don’t really want to repeat too much of it. Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. -I haven’t been watching any briefings, in fact as a family we did not watch Johnson’s address on 10th May as we kinda knew what was being said and it’s the same for the daily briefings. They’re quite pointless as little is gained from them every day and the ministers read off a sheet and are woefully underprepared aside from that. It’s a lot easier just to read the breaking news flashes and to get the news that way as it’s more concise and you don’t have to hear the ministers justifying what’s been going on or their plans which many won’t even be implemented so overall it’s a really hard sell. The older generation are from a time where politicians should be trusted and these regular broadcasts appeal to them a lot more than younger people I would say. I’ve just been getting my news via social media and online news articles and it seems the easiest way to get concise information and also you can find out things about other countries as it’s not often reported on national news as they want to avoid comparisons as they know how badly the UK is doing and they really don’t want to highlight this. Whenever figures from other countries decrease, they never report this and they are always looking to sensationalise the bad things instead of talking about recoveries and falling numbers from elsewhere and the methods they have taken in order to get to that positive stage. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? -Absolutely, we should follow Scotland’s lead! But this has been the case from the start, Sturgeon has shown great leadership throughout and little gestures like this go a long way to help some of the most marginalised in society feel part of a big community and not left out. It’s very much the same for autistic people who for many, staying inside for such a long time is crippling for them and their families and these people are often overlooked and it’s so sad to see that those who cannot fit into every generic box, get hit hardest of all. But no one I know has experienced any struggles gaining access to news, my gran gets newspapers delivered every day so this helps and she also has a tv and she’s been exploring some other channels in this period too. Audio description and sign language is a great way of making it more accessible and maybe some extra braille supplements in newspapers or magazines would also help to make it easier for everyone. Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. -Personally I am a student so I haven’t been affected financially or within the workplace during the lockdown. Uni has been very accommodating and this is the case for many unis across the country with a no detriment policy which is a really sensible thing to do and something I’m very much in support of. However it can affect your productivity as you only have to pass in order to get a respectable mark and scoring a high mark is very hard in this period due to lack of resources and the fact that everyone is very out of sync with normal life. But I believe the only reason unis have done this is in order to stop people asking for money back since we pay so much for our tuition. If fees were lower as in the rest of Europe, then this policy would probably not exist as it doesn’t exist abroad. If people are still getting a good degree they’re much less likely to want their money back but if you’re taking people’s money and failing them, then we could see the collapse of unis as institutions very quickly. The only way they can survive is with money and they can only have money if people are getting what they want from them, problem solved. Concentrating on uni work has been a lot harder during this period though but I’m trying to do work little and often and hoping this is the best way to manage it and to get ahead of deadlines which I’m used to doing anyway. -Dad however has been furloughed but he wishes he could still work, not so much for the money right now but because of the fact he is bored and isn’t used to not working. Job security is worrying though as furlough will stop at some stage and companies will not be able to afford and have the demand to bring all workers back at this stage so equally it is a worrying time. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? -Actually this isn’t a topic which I can’t write so much about since I don’t have children myself and relationships haven’t changed a whole lot. Dad has struggled a lot not being at work and he has been irritable at times but that’s about it really, mum has also struggled being inside at times and not seeing her mum as often as normal. But we’ve just tried to stay busy and in a routine which has helped to mitigate some of the factors. Although I do think that mum and dad have been able to spend more time together than over the last 25 years or so which seems pretty crazy but even them going for walks together has been really nice for them both I think. Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? -I was pretty familiar with these technologies before the lockdown so it hasn’t been much of a change, whatsapp especially since we all use it to communicate in our family anyway and that hasn’t changed, plus it’s the best way to speak to people in different countries so I’ve been very used to using it before. I haven’t used house party as I don’t really have enough friends for that! Plus most of my friends are individual and not in a group so this doesn’t really work in this case, plus I’ve seen a lot of stories about it being hacked and taking people’s details so I’m glad I avoided it and I’m not really into that kinda thing anyway…it seems to be something which is for the popular people and those who enjoy parties and pub quizzes. I’ve tried my best to video chat with friends during this period but some people prefer doing it to others, some like messaging and others don’t really like it at all so its been a mixed experience with everything. I’m not a huge fan of video chatting anyway as I really enjoy speaking on messages more but it’s better than nothing so I’ve done it now and again. Uni used Zoom in order to do our online classes and it is a really good platform, don’t we all wish we brought some shares in it a few months ago! Some tutors have been a little uncomfortable using it and I really feel for them as there’s a lot of pressure on them to adjust really quickly to something totally new and my tutors have honestly done a great job with it so I’m pleased for them and hopefully they have felt happy too. I don’t think online classes can be the future though, it’s a very different experience and not at all worth the money which we pay for it. If they do decide to have some degrees online from September, I guarantee that many students will defer or pull out and this will have huge implications for the uni industry, renting industry and job industry! I don’t think people understand student power and how important it can be. If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? -This has really depended on the person in question…I have tried to re-connect with people who have drifted away from me by messaging them and checking in on them to show that I care and sometimes this has proven successful, but overall it sadly hasn’t and I’ve really found this hard as I thought it would be the perfect time to reconnect and most people have told me that this has been the case which has frustrated me more as I haven’t been able to pull it off. I’ve always struggled socially and this felt like my opportunity to put it right but sadly it hasn’t been the case but there are still some positives to take away and these are important for me. It hasn’t been a pressure at all as I enjoy talking online and I’ve really tried to grasp that but its hard if I have friends who I want to stay close to but they don’t like speaking online as this is just a terrible situation, especially if these people are still living with other friends or are breaking rules and seeing them during this period while I’m at home not seeing anyone. I do worry about a lot of my international friends since they’re lockdown restrictions are getting relaxed so it means they can see friends a lot sooner than me and I definitely worry about being left behind…just as I was starting to make some real social progress too which is the sad thing as I don’t want that progress to be lost. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? -I’m on social media a lot in general and I would say my use of social media has been relatively the same over this period, maybe a little more on Twitter but really not a whole lot much. I think it’s the best place to check in with news instead of news channels though as it can only be short and concise on twitter and that’s all you really want to know about it. It’s definitely very hard to escape from things and social media doesn’t really let you do that as there’s always some type of Corona post around the corner, whether it be good or bad and that’s just a part of life now. I don’t use Facebook a whole lot anyway, maybe just check it once or twice a day and that’s really it and I don’t think it’s a good place for news as people are on it more than other social media so it’s a lot easier to spread fake news and for people to be angry with the comments in this case and it’s quite a toxic social media nowadays. Twitter is sadly becoming like that too but it’s still a good place for news and to try to judge public opinion although that’s very hard since I think in general there’s more left-wing than right-wing people on twitter and that definitely doesn’t reflect society in general sadly. And year Instagram is fine, like I enjoy it to see what’s going on in people’s lives and you also get a good sense over who’s breaking the rules by seeing the posts on there and who people are with and it’s always a place to go which can then make you feel jealous about other people’s lives but that’s also the way it has always been. What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? -My parents have done the food shopping during this period but previously I would go with my gran each week and help her but we have limited the number of people going to the shops so it can be done efficiently and as safely as possible. At first, many key items such as pasta and rice were missing but these have slowly been replenished. Some things such as eggs and flour still have a shortage and although this is the case, it’s frustrating that the item limit is still kept in place as there is no real reason for it and no end in sight as to when it might be removed which again worries me about other restrictions which will be put in place over the coming weeks and month. My parents have usually chosen times when they do not believe there will be large queues at the shops, such as early morning or in the evening to prevent waiting times but sometimes this can be hard as its hard to know when the shops will be at their busiest. Sometimes people in the shops have not been respectful, other customers and not staff, and there’s nothing you can do about this and if people are not going to keep distance, its just tough really and this will continue in many different places for months to come. Ideally, we would’ve wanted to do the shopping online but my dad doesn’t quite qualify for the most at risk category so this hasn’t been possible sadly and does increase the risk by going to the shop. We tried to book some slots by keep looking on the websites and we could’ve got one Ocado slot a few weeks ago but it was right after they went shopping so there wasn’t much point and now they’ve kinda given up with that since stocks are higher and queues are generally lower. The idea of giving slots to the most ill and vulnerable is a good idea but it doesn’t always work since the most vulnerable are usually the ones with no connection to the internet to be able to do this and not all of them have family who can help out or do the shopping for them. There was a big market to employ more people to pick food and deliver it to a larger range of the population but this didn’t happen quite to the extent I think it could’ve done. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? -I don’t really cook personally so my cooking habits have remained minimal and unchanged! But we’ve definitely changed as a household, mainly actually because everyone is at home so everyone can eat at the same time and therefore everyone can have the same meal. This has been half a conscious decision to save money but also because of circumstances. We’ve eaten a lot more meat based products as we have tried to buy cheap, large quantities and divide it out for different meals e.g. making meatballs or mince for a homemade lasagne. We always had a lot of homemade meals but I think that has increased over this period, especially as ready meals are just a little more expensive and the fact there’s less choice over them at the moment too, since a lot more people are buying them. I’ve also had to drink less milk due to the quantity limits in shops as we haven’t gone shopping as often and therefore cannot buy as much milk and instead I’ve had to have some fruit squash to subsidise for the lack of milk, although due to having eczema flared up by fruit, this isn’t ideal but hasn’t actually affected it too much in this period luckily. We did buy a lot of food pre-lockdown so we’ve slowly used this up over the period and it was definitely a big help to stock up on food beforehand as it meant that we didn’t have to go out as often in the more difficult periods and our outgoings reduced as our income did as well. We’ve continued to make homemade cakes, bread and other things in this period which has been super nice and it’s another thing for my mum and sister to spend time on and that’s always a good thing right now too. But personally, my eating times and what I’ve eaten hasn’t changed a whole lot. We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? -I haven’t really taken up any new hobbies since a lot of my time has been spent working on uni stuff or having/preparing for online classes so right now there hasn’t been so much change in my life compared to normal which has probably allowed me to cope a lot better than some people, especially on a personal level. Routine has been key to all of this and to entertaining myself actually since I have had a fairly set routine which has included a 5km walk at the start of each day and this is an increase from any exercise I would do when I’m just at home, but if I was going to uni for example I’d probably walk around 6km/7km a day anyway so compared to this its kinda similar really. We’ve also been playing board games which we enjoyed doing before anyway but now we’ve been able to play more of them and more often which has been nice and also we’ve had a mini pool table we’ve been able to put on the patio outside so I guess playing this to a higher standard has been one new skill I’ve learnt but we did do this occasionally in previous summers. I’ve also tried to become a more skilled video gamer playing Gran Turismo Sport as in the official championship last year I was top-15 in UK but since I don’t put in hours a day like some people, I was hoping to match that again this year with a lot less practice than most people. Dad has done a lot of DIY jobs and house maintenance so all of this is now up to date instead of being staggered throughout the year but it isn’t something which I do myself. There are also lots of repeats of tv shows on at the moment and some I enjoy watching if I haven’t seen them since my childhood but dad will watch shows and films over and over again and he almost pretends he’s never seen them before which really isn’t something I can do at all. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. - I’m not a particularly big listener of anything really, including music, so I haven’t been  listening to anything new or different in this period. Sometimes I play pop music while  playing video games to relax me but that’s about it and I’ve also never read an audio book  before!  - Reading wise, it’s been mainly academic stuff related to my Masters dissertation and this has  meant that I haven’t had the chance to read anything for pleasure and that is the problem  with being a student at times as you don’t really have as much desire to read for pleasure  when you’re reading academic articles most days.  - I have been watching a lot of new tv series during this period as tv series aren’t something  which I watch as much as most other people of my age but I have very much enjoyed getting  into them, albeit on illegal websites. I firstly watched “You” which I enjoyed although maybe  it didn’t quite live up to expectations. And then I watched “Project Blue Book” which is very  much my type of show about conspiracies etc but again I was slightly underwhelmed and  now I’m watching “Mindhunter” which is different again being a crime show but I’m maybe  enjoying this one more than the other series. All of these have been recommendations by  friends since I also want to be able to speak to people about the shows I’m watching as my  taste in series is very different to my parents really.  Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? -Yes it has actually, I am still having a shower and washing my hair once a day in the morning and that hasn’t changed but I am shaving less and its probably a habit which I will carry forward into the future. I wasn’t that bothered about not shaving before but I just built it into a weekly routine and now that its hard to maintain a routine, I’ve just shaved when I wanted to as a result and I don’t feel any better or worse about it, I just think it something I’d prefer not to do and therefore I’ve just done it less. The whole idea of needing to be clean shaven in order to be presentable is very old fashioned now anyway despite some people still thinking it’s a requirement of jobs when this in fact has long gone. It’s more fashionable and possibly even more desirable to have stubble or some form of a beard anyway. Of course my hair is growing since I’ve been unable to get it cut but we ordered some hair clippers and a shaver so dad’s can be cut as he doesn’t like it getting long at all whereas I’m a little less worried about it and I got my hair cut before lockdown anyway so it hasn’t got to a critical level yet! We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. -I’ve heard a lot of stories about people having weird and wonderful dreams and it’s definitely been the same here too. My sleeping has been pretty good until the start of May but that’s mainly been due to the fact it’s so light in the morning and not other factors. Keeping in a sleeping routine has been important since then your sleeping pattern isn’t disturbed and I’ve never been someone who can stay up super late anyway so in all honesty it hasn’t affected me so much and I think the same can be said for my mum and sister. Dad has been getting up early as he finds it hard to sleep a lot and he’d rather be doing things instead of sleeping which is understandable, but sometimes he’ll stay up late to watch films and I think this can mess with the sleeping patterns too. -In terms of dreams, I have had some nightmares but they’ve been aeroplane ones which are very common for me, so common I have a log with how often I have them and it’s often a couple of times a month and this has been unchanged. The planes usually crash and fall out of the sky with me on the ground looking on helplessly. The two most vivid dreams I have had have both been about crushes of some sort – the first featured online friend LS who I rarely speak to but I very much enjoy it when we do speak and at this point I had not spoken to her for maybe a month or more which is why it was extremely random. It was almost as if we were married and she was in her wedding dress and we were going to a quiz night at uni and it was about motorsport which is a common topic of ours and when I woke up from the dream it prompted me to message her and she replied and said how nice it was to hear from me so I wonder if it was trying to tell me, or even her, something. My other vivid dream was about famous racing driver SF who I have had a connection with in the past, almost at a friendly type level 5 years ago which seems absolutely crazy looking back at things now. But the dreams were twofold, one at a racetrack and we were spectating together which I guess was kinda normal and standard and then another with her in my room and we were just cuddling and chilling out and it reminded me of good times we spent together, obviously not at all intimate and this came on the five year anniversary of a really special day in both of our lives so dreams seem to have a lot more meaning in this period which is interesting."

Mass-Observer M6790 describes themself as female; age 66; married; retired associate lecturer at the open university.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","Part 2: Covid19 (written 100+ days into the pandemic, as lockdown measures are being eased) Health: We’ve been lucky so far, though the prolonged self-isolation causes some blue-moody days for no apparent reason other than the fact that we can’t do the normal things in life we have always taken for granted: seeing family and friends in our own home; going out to meet them; going shopping for food or clothing; doing the things like research that is an important part of our lives. We have been lucky that we haven’t had any need for medical or professional help yet. Emotionally this period is tough because it keeps us apart from our family and close friends and it also forces the two of us to spend so much time together, when we each have our own interests outside the home. As parents and grandparents we feel disenfranchised to some degree because we are not allowed to go and see our children and grandchildren because we all live in separate ‘bubbles’. Generational relationships are changing too: we’re now told by our grown-up children that we’re in a vulnerable age group and must follow the rules. My silent response is that we aren’t that old and we don’t need telling, but I suppose we’re now hearing the things we said to our children when they were younger coming back to haunt us! It’s all taken in good fun and we know it’s still necessary at the beginning of July that we still maintain social distance. As there’s no vaccine, it’s also becoming clear that our old ways of life have changed for the time being, even though many businesses have restarted following lockdown: shops are now open and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers can reopen tomorrow (4 July 2020). There’s quite an emotional impact in learning the numbers of people who are now out of work as companies close down or fail to re-open. The continuing financial crash will make these aspects of the pandemic yet more severe. The Government: I began writing this Directive several weeks ago and have only now in July come back to finish it. One of the good things about this delay is that I can reflect on what’s happened so far. I’m convinced that if we had locked down sooner, fewer lives would have been lost to this horrible disease. We had been waiting for several weeks for it to arrive and had been staggered and horrified by the huge numbers of deaths elsewhere, particularly in Italy, Spain and France. I’m convinced that, when it came, most people took serious notice of the instruction to stay at home to protect lives and the NHS. It was absolutely astonishing to hear that the Prime Minister’s aide Dominic Cummings had found it acceptable to drive over 200 miles from London to his parent’s house in the North East when his wife (and then Cummings himself) apparently developed some coronavirus symptoms, so that their small son could be looked after by family. Up until that point I believe everyone had stuck to the rules -there were reports of parents in similar situations all around the country continuing to look after their small children unaided while they were both ill from the virus themselves. This whole thing was such a debacle and so disturbing that I wrote to my MP, Jo Churchill, to complain about Cummings’ behaviour. She wrote back saying basically that she agreed. Yet Cummings and Johnson seem unable to understand what was wrong with what Cummings did: one rule for him and another for everyone else?? It is hardly surprising that ‘Black Lives Matter’ marches, illegal raves, crowding on the beaches have been going on since this time and that there are spikes in infection in different places. At the same time as fighting the pandemic, the government has remained hell-bent on sticking to the 31 December 2021 as the final transition date for leaving the EU. Yet businesses are closing down everywhere because of the pandemic and the UK has not yet worked out a trade agreement with the EU. The focus of Boris Johnson’s attention is now the economy and it seems as if all manner of building applications will be allowed since construction is foregrounded as a major way to ‘restart’ the economy. There is little evidence of new trade agreements with other non-EU countries. All in all, the government’s poor planning on Brexit has been wiped out by the virus and there seems little hope of economic recovery for years. News As always, I hear the main national and international news through BBC radio and television. I listen to local news on Radio Suffolk and read the East Anglian Daily Times for local news – I have taken out an online subscription since lockdown. We watched almost all the press conferences at 5 and were surprised that they have now gone altogether, yet there are still spikes in infection.  Most of the press conferences were informative and reassuring, particularly the statistical parts led by the scientists and medical officers. It’s vital for everyone to have access to the news and for it to be offered through BSL or other means where needed.  I suspect that social media need to improve the kind of news that is made available on their sites -there is clearly a sector of the population that does not watch any of the main news channels and appears not to have a clue about what is going on in the world. Work and home life I am no longer in paid employment but went back to university last year to undertake research study and I have continued with that as far as possible: all journals and some books are available online, as are many primary sources.  Interaction with the university is via Skype and Teams.  Having this focus has been quite a luxury during such horrible times as there is a good deal of mutual support between staff and students at the university. In many ways I am lucky that I am not having to home-school young children as are some other students; the downside of it is that I would love to be able to do that to help my grandchildren, but am not allowed to do so. Other than that, life at home carries on much the same as usual, while all round the UK thousands of people have died from the virus. Technology: Yes, I’ve tried a few more forms of technology during lockdown. I’ve learnt to use FaceTime, Zoom, Skype and Teams.  I’ve had two or three formal meetings on Skype and Teams and several less formal family and friend get-togethers on FaceTime and Zoom. It’s been great to talk to close family via FaceTime, as otherwise it would not be possible to see them, but it is definitely not a medium you’d use in preference to being close to them. I avoid Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so don’t find them a form of escape. What am I missing out on? Shopping and Food: To start with it was difficult to buy groceries because we had to ‘shield’ for health reasons and couldn’t go to the supermarket. In the first few weeks it was impossible to book a delivery from anyone, but we eventually booked deliveries from Tesco’s, Morrison’s and a wholesaler who normally supplies restaurants and caterers. The most reliable suppliers have been a local baker and a farm shop which sells most things -both have a ‘click and collect service’ which I feel confident in using because there are few people about there. We ran out of milk and were very low on many items before we had the first delivery. We were careful to make everything do two meals where possible and ate more vegetables to make meat or chicken go further.  I would say we are eating more healthily because we didn’t go out initially, the cafés were shut and we avoided the coffees and snacks we might otherwise have bought out. That said, we baked scones and fruit cakes from ingredients in the cupboard but didn’t have any icing sugar so couldn’t make sponge cakes with fillings. When you hear of the numbers of people who have lost their lives to this horrible virus, our experiences were entirely trivial and of no consequence at all. Life in the last few weeks has calmed down and it’s been easier to get slots for food deliveries. I continue to use local small farm-shops and the baker and have yet to do my own supermarket shopping.  Entertainment and Leisure: When lockdown came in, out went my two or three weekly visits to a local women’s gym. The exercise bike that has languished in the garage for years came into the living room but hasn’t been used much.  On the other hand I have done a lot of gardening and we usually go for a walk in the village once a day. Being outside has been not only vital for mental health but it has been such a privilege to see nature changing daily. During the good weather in May and June I took books outside and read in the shade of a tree in the garden, but it’s sometimes been hard to concentrate. I took out my sewing machine for the first time in ten years and made a few face masks, though I’m not sure I would count that as a hobby. They took ages and didn’t fit very well! Personal hygiene: Everything is pretty well the same as normal – we had, or were able to order, adequate supplies of soap, shampoo and so on.  The biggest thing for me and most people has been the fact that we haven’t been able to have our hair cut. Hairdressers open tomorrow (4 July) and my hairdresser in the village has offered me an appointment on 16th. I can’t wait – my hair is usually fairly short but it’s grown a good deal since the last appointment in March and I now need to pin it back.  My husband keeps his hair short all over (#2 at the barber’s) and, in desperation, he persuaded me to cut it for him with his beard trimmer. That was a first for me and I have to say it looked all right – except that #2 on his trimmer turned out to be shorter than at the barber’s .. Sleep: Sleep is often in quite short supply for me in normal times: I have periods of very slight sleep and often feel ‘heavy’ and tired as a result of this. Strangely, during the pandemic I’ve slept much better, even in the hotter weather and long nights. This has been surprising but I suspect it relates to the fact that I now have fewer obligations to be at certain places at specific terms.  It could also be a symptom of slight depression but, either way, on many days I have felt much more refreshed and rested than usual."

Mentally, though, I just feel neglected and pushed to one side, and thus forgotten. My daughter, a hospital consultant, urged my wife and I into self-isolation long before it became government policy. It would keep us safe, and we'd be able to order all our food needs online. How naïve can you be? Se later for the impossibility of obtaining home deliveries of food. Maybe I am being selfish and unfair, but it is clear that I am expected to do exactly what I am told and not complain. Furthermore, since I am retired and thus deemed to be economically inactive, I come way down the list of concerns after all those youngsters who are flouting rule all over the place; and after elderly folk who do have underlying health problems, since no health service can be seen to be ignoring such people. It doesn't need a degree in logical thinking to work out that that puts me right at the bottom of the pile, and if I have to stay there until there is a vaccine for all (I shall be last for that, too, I expect), that probably puts my release date until well towards Christmas, 2021. (May 2020) As time went on conditions were relaxed, but not for old, unwell people who had been shielding and self-isolating, and these felt very, very insecure. I write particularly about a close friend of mine who lives nearby. When she could finally go outside, in early August, her world had been utterly changed, and overrun in pubs and crowded beaches by young people ignoring all social distancing rules and wanting to have their idea of fun, while others suffered. Infection rates soared inevitably, and local restrictions began (thank good ness by now the Government was acting rapidly). But no young people seemed to be repentant or even think they were responsible. One tiny, personal example of how others suffered from this selfishness: my wife's brother is dying with liver cancer. He lives in North Staffordshire, and we fitted in two visits before the lockdown, and one in mid-July, using a country house hotel which we knew, that had adapted to the new situation brilliantly. We were all pleased we could pay the visit. Soon after the pubs re-opened and scores of youngsters crowded into a pub very close to that hotel and where my brother-in-law lives. Immediately the authorities were alerted and started testing those who had been there. To date there have been 22 cases because of this one incident. We had planned to visit for my brother-in-law's birthday this coming week. For everybody's sake, we cancelled it. We shall now never again see him on his birthday. This makes me feel very angry! (August 2020) The Government At first the Government was incredibly slow to take decisive action, and the bleat about following scientific advice and if we take action too soon nobody will follow it were total bunkum. Their early decisions were based far more on not wanting to offend those going to the Cheltenham races than on any science. It was pathetic. Even when the Prime Minister had Covid-19 himself and was apparently at death's door, the government still seemed to lack decision. The change of motto from Stay at home to Stay alert was very woolly and was a disaster. Even worse, when the chief adviser decided to drive from London to County Durham while showing symptoms, and then to drive for 60 miles just to discover if he was fit enough to drive back – and was defended, not censured – that drove a coach and horses through the Government's diktats for the rest of us. Now, though (August 2020) they do seem to have learned their lessons, and action is being targeted and is swift, to try to avoid or at least minimise a second spike. I have no sympathy with those who complain about having to quarantine on return from a holiday in Spain, for nobody forced them to travel abroad. The targeted measures now in place for areas with a sudden increase in cases looks like being effective. Maybe we are beginning to learn lessons from Germany, where decisions have been more instant and clearer right from the start. News Our main sources of information have been the BBC News Channel and the internet. I've been very interested in international comparisons so I've made regular use of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center website, which is excellent. I am thankful that there has been little attempt at deliberate misinformation here, unlike in the USA. In the early days we watched almost all of the Briefings from Downing Street, noting that it took many weeks before the three presenters learned how to enter the room used without infringing social distancing. I was impressed by the way so many ministers and scientific experts were involved, and given equal prominence. This was in stark contrast to the disastrous one-man shows staged in Washington by President Trump. We had no problems accessing the news, other than that for our own mental health, we saw too much! I was very impressed by the standard of Nicola Sturgeon's briefings in Scotland, which were always clear, compassionate and concise, as well as including signing. I often wished that she was in charge of the entire United Kingdom. (August 2020) Work and home life My wife and I are both retired, and in our mid-70s. We do have many friends and neighbours who have had to deal with home education, and because we were both primary teachers, we have offered advice and practical support, where this has been requested. We have not been involved first-hand with any pupils or students. Our two daughters and their husbands have mainly been working from home, and they report that it has been very productive. (August 2020) Technology I do not use any social media, for several reasons (insecurity of links; confidentiality; social pressure, lies and bullying; inability to remove postings). I had joined WhatsApp a few months previously, and I've been active in using this for two groups: the church bell-ringers, and an Italian group. I did not use it for the poetry group I lead because that would have excluded two people, but I have tried to keep the group together and active just using email, and this has had some experience. Life has been very lonely and isolating, though, for those without internet access – and there are many of those around still. My experience with Zoom has been mixed. I've used it with the ringers, but my computer has no camera attached, so I've either had to share my wife's or try to master the iPad, which still makes no sense to me. The Zoom meetings I've experienced have not been well led and were, quite frankly, a frustrating waste of time. (August 2020) Shopping and food Our eating and cooking habits have stayed the same, but shopping has been a problem. When our doctor-daughter insisted we self-isolate a good week before the national lockdown, we did manage to get hold of two delivery slots, albeit only three days apart. Thereafter we found it impossible: all slots in the next three weeks had been taken, but new ones would be released at midnight. Three times we stayed up until midnight, logged into the site – but by the time their system let us onto the right page, the new tranche of slots had all gone. So we had to shop ourselves, very early, locally, using face masks that we made ourselves to a pattern found online. We did manage to get an order for fruit and veg from an excellent local shop, but they kept changing their system, so overwhelmed were they, that we gave that up also. We were able to get a regular order for milk, although neither website nor phone lines worked, such was the demand; one day I was on the phone for over seven hours, just about securing a milk order. This is not good for one's health! Entertainment and Leisure I don't need, in your phrase, to 'entertain myself'. I have so many interests and things I'd love to do. Time never drags – it races, and has done during the lockdown. The problem is not what to do, but the loss of rhythm and pattern I n life, and both of those are fundamental to health, as one becomes older. So I've been continuing with my existing interests, as far as possible: . gardening and running the small community allotment (although it was impossible to obtain seeds at first and those I bought online were abysmal at germinating) . making model railways (I've been concentrating on wagons and vans of the pre-grouping English lines – thank goodness for small suppliers of bits, and for delivery firms) . some DIY jobs about the house . Writing my autobiography for the grandsons . planning my next novel . writing poems and keeping the poetry group going, online . baking new cakes . learning Italian – our native teacher has done a great job motivating our group and suppling books to read . keeping up with Spanish, German and French . reading lots, mainly fiction, travel and biography . learning handbell ringing Group activities, like bell ringing, poetry groups, choirs, concerts and church services have all ceased. Very, very sad, for this sort of social activity is vital for mental health as we become older! Personal hygiene I probably wash my hands more frequently and thoroughly now. I don't mentally sing 'Happy Birthday to you' but two verses of the Italian resistance song, 'Bella ciao' which lasts for about 30 seconds. At first this caused considerable pain, because the hand wash was too caustic and frequent washing caused constant soreness, but we now use a kinder one. We now regularly wash hands and disinfect the front door, etc, whenever we come into the house. At first we wiped down every piece of mail which arrived, until we realised that the virus could not live for long on paper and cardboard. Sleep Fortunately my sleep has not been disturbed by nightmares. It gets disturbed already by needing to go to the bathroom, but fortunately I usually go straight back to sleep."

The times I remember when I have not were:• Early in the lock-down, driving to work and seeing the roads so empty. It's nice not having any traffic but remembering why there was no traffic upset me;• When a friend had to cancel her Pilates classes and therapy sessions. She runs her own business, so I felt very upset on her behalf;• Over the Easter weekend -we are part of a group of four couples {one sadly now widowed) whose children went to the same nursery and we have been 'getting together' three or four times a year for the last 25 years. We would have been doing something on one of the days over Easter and I felt very sad that were not doing it this year;• At the end of the second Great British Sewing Bee episode when there was a big group hug with the sewer who was leaving. I made me suddenly realise what we have lost, at least for the foreseeable future;• I sing in a choir and you can't really replace that. Just before lock-down I started learning the alto recorder. I have not played it since lock-down as this is for better times and I miss music too much. Just writing this upsets me. So I just don't think about it as there is nothing to be done a present.I think, overall, that the political decisions that have been made are OK, particularly at the beginning- although I am writing this before Boris's address to the nation this evening so may feel differently then. I can see that balancing everything is an incredibly difficult task and those in government are human like the rest of us. I fear for the economy, and the future job situation, and at one point did feel that everything was being sacrificed for the NHS. But, I could not see what else could be done at that moment in time. I do think, however, that there was a big mistake was with respect to care homes. Over Easter there was an item on the radio from a care home manager who said that they were told to take people discharged from hospital. Contractually they could not refuse, yet these people had not been tested so they could have been bringing the virus in with them. This does seem to be a bit of a blind spot, to say the least. I also think that testing should have been scaled up much sooner - I don't see how you can move forward without access to comprehensive testing.The Government is going to have to open up the economy, but I really don't know how they are going to deal with the situation with regard to public transport. My husband travelled by train to work, and I drive. We would both love to walk or cycle, but his work is 15 miles from home and my work is 19 miles from home, so this is not possible. There is talk of 'more services' to allow for socialdistancing, but Northern could not reliably deliver the service advertised before the pandemic so the idea of them increasing services is a joke. I dread the thought that everyone will just pile into their cars instead - my journey to work was already bad. A close friend is a teacher and she is within the '50%' of people who are supposed to live within 3 miles of where they work. However, a) there are several large hills between where she lives and she works, and b) as a teacher she carries a lot of stuff between home and school. So she is not going to be walking/cycling to work either. The government is going to have to get a whole lot more real about this aspect of getting the economy going again II stick to the BBC - TV and online.I have watched some of the daily briefings and think that they have generally been well-structured. I like that different people lead them, and various experts are present as well.I don't have challenges but I have noted the signer with the Scottish briefings. I think that this is very good and should have been done for the Westminster briefings.Both my husband and I have been working through the lock-down so far. He has been working from home but I have to go into work. Most people in my company have either been furloughed or are working from home so there is just a small group of us actually in work. We are all part of the same department anyway (which is why are in work) but we have formed a close working group as a result of it being just us.Because it has been just my husband and I at home, and we are both still in employment, there has not been too much strain at home, although perhaps we have been a bit more snappy with each other, especially early on when everything was so very worrying. I think that we have also just settled into the routine more as time has gone on and not look too far ahead - even I am learning not to worry about the things I can't change! My mother lives just round the corner, so when we deliver her paper we ring the bell for a quick chat. The more distant relatives are well, so far, so that has not been an immediate worry. We have been lucky.We have started to use Zoom for meetings with our friends, and our son and his girlfriend, and I have had to become reacquainted with Facebook (which I never really used) for the Scrub Hub. Work has also organised quizzes using Survey Monkey and Zoom. This afternoon my husband has set up an online Dungeons and Dragons session, as the group has not been able to meet since lock­ down. All of these things have been a bit of a challenge at first, but we are OK with it all now.So far we have been lucky with shopping- my husband does the shopping and was able to get pretty much all he needed even when people were panic-buying. As there is just the two of us and we are pretty flexible, ingredients could be swapped where needed. We have not really changed our eating habits (perhaps a bit more chocolate and cake!).We always have a list of things that need doing in the house or garden so this has actually been a good opportunity to get on with things- thank goodness for online deliveries! We have both been producing things for key workers (my husband has been 3D printing visor parts and I have been making scrubs bags) so we have not really had chance to be bored. I am missing Zumba and Pilates but am walking more regularly, and we are walking more locally-we did not realise quite how manynice walks there are nearby. My TV viewing has probably reduced as I now have quite a lot to do in the evenings!There have been no changes in my personal hygiene as my routine is the same as it was before lock­ down.I would not say that my sleep has been massively affected. I am at a time of life when one tends to wake up in the night anyway, so am used to being awake, sometime for quite long periods. If anything, it is possibly better, because I worry about it less - it is suddenly OK to have sleep issues, or at least talk about them, so I feel less at odds with other people and a bit more like I am normal."

Health I live on my own, and have been on my own throughout lockdown.  I am an introvert and like time away from others, so for me this period has been pleasurable – entirely so for the first two months. I have had the odd dip, but overall my mental health has been very good.  I get to do what I like, and have been blamelessly absent from work for a great stretch of time with more to come. I have been able to see that when I was working, I underestimated the toll that being around other people (even though I mostly liked them) and doing stuffI didn’t particularly enjoy took on my energy.  Having said that, I wouldn’t want to live like this permanently, so I suppose the knowledge that it is a time-limited opportunity is a definite factor in my predominantly positive mood. I would also say that nobody is totally an introvert, and since the start of June, I have felt more of a need for human interaction and a slight but increasing dissatisfaction with my isolation. Previously some people liked to bang on about their wonderful lives, fabulous partners and adorable children, but over the last few weeks, in all seriousness, experts have been telling us that spending too much time cooped up with our families is damaging to our mental health. I might say, Well, which is it? –but that’s obviously unfair. Not everyone who’s keen to let you know they love their family is a performative social media copycat.  Too much of a good thing is still too much.  On Wednesday 8th April, one of the topics on Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 phone-in was couples falling out because they were now with one another all the time. He made the point that couples are usually together, when awake, for an average of two and a half hours a day, but that under lockdown this has increased to 16. My friend N. and I discussed our mental health during lockdown (she has had her own issues in the past).  She said, ‘Living with others involves doing things you don’t like constantly, especially when you are the one doing all the domestic chores.  I manage by spending most of my day alone.  We all do really.  We all have things to do which don’t involve anyone else. E [youngest son] spends most of every day on his own, practicing organ, whether or not its lockdown.  He said to me that he is actually perfectly content with the current situation because he is used to being on his own and that the joke is on those who normally have a hectic social life and like going to parties. Its definitely one nil to the introvert, and that makes a nice change. In some ways I think being in lockdown as a couple would be harder than with more people.  I feel sorry for my parents in this respect.  They find each other annoying at the best of times and now there is never anyone else around to dilute the tension.  I’m pleased you recognise the benefits of being on your own.’ My physical health has improved as well.  I have got back into running, and go three or four days a week, and take walks the rest of the time.  I had a few injuries (pulled muscles) in the early weeks, but sent off for a couple of calf support sleeves, and have been fine since.  I have noticed my stamina improving throughout.  One morning recently, I came back from a session (twenty minutes of running, one minute of walking, ten minutes of running, another minute of walking) and felt so invigorated and pleased with myself! (but with no-one to tell). I’m not sure Ican describe my emotions separatelyfrom my mental health.  One of my characteristics is to put off things which I find disagreeable or uninteresting.  (For example, I either glance at and don’t deal with, or don’t even open, some items of post for several weeks.) Most of the time, this doesn’t really serve me well.  However, the behaviour asked of all of us under lockdown has enabled me to put off many things I don’t ordinarily enjoy – e.g.: going to work, dealing with other people – without having to feel bad about it. If my mother were still alive, I would be very worried about how she was managing; but there is no-one close to me who is especially vulnerable, and so I have no anxieties about anyone else’s health.  I paid off my mortgage more than a decade ago and have a lot of money in savings, and although the possibility that my place of work (in the hospitality sector) might never re-open saddens me, I would be able to support myself for years to come. Some people, not personally affected, will look back on this period as a happy time.  I know the same is not true for everyone.  I imagine a lot of extroverts are having a miserable experience. The Government I wonder how many contributors will say that the Government have been doing a good job. Not many, I would guess.  Tribal loyalties fall away when people are in fear for their lives.  Based on the notes I made, I’ve categorized some of the failures: The Government’s incapacity to act Looking back at my coronavirus diary, I was surprised that only five days separated Boris Johnson’s speech to the nation announcing lockdown (Monday 23rd March) from the news he had the illness.  The Conservatives, banking on his supposed popularity, have so far promoted him as a presidential figure.  He stands for the Government.  But there we were, only a few days in, leaderless.  In fact we had been leaderless – with regards to the pandemic – long before that. Johnson is a dilettante, emphatically not someone who likes to knuckle down to anything, and while the virus was ripping through China and then Italy, he found it comfortable to believe it couldn’t happen here.  During an interview on This Morning in early March, he noted complacently that he was still shaking hands when he visited hospitals.  As the infection rate rose, it became apparent the Government were afraid to make major decisions.  On 16th March, the news reported that Welsh and Scottish schools were to close from the following Monday, which left Johnson’s Government in a position where they had no choice but to look weak and play catch up.  On 17th March, they couldn’t find the courage to order the closure of pubs, theatres and restaurants, instead telling the public they should stop going to them.  It was left to theatres to cancel future performances, in effect closing themselves.  Discussions with colleagues at work were mostly about the inevitability of some form of lockdown (as instituted by other countries).  Marketing manager A, the boringly doting mother of an eight year old, felt the Government were holding back so lockdown could coincide with the Easter holidays (in Birmingham schools broke up on Friday 3rd April) to mitigate childcare issues.  S (mid-twenties, bright, a bit lairy) was still going to the pub and casinos, but also thought the Government should have enforced lockdown a fortnight before.  Subsequent to his hospitalization, when Boris Johnson was recuperating at Chequers, he was taken to task by the Sunday Times (19th April) for his early refusal to take the virus seriously; they reported he had failed to turn up to five meetings (which he would have chaired) of the Government’s emergency COBRA committee.  By the end of May, research was suggesting that if lockdown had begun ten days earlier, many lives could have been saved.  In this period, there was a big UEFA football game in Liverpool as well as the Cheltenham races.  In both areas there was a notable spike in cases afterwards. On 10th June, Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the Government’s chief scientific advisers, told a Parliamentary scrutiny committee that 20,000 lives (at that point half of those who died, according to official figures) could have been saved if we’d gone into lockdown a week earlier.  It has been a commonplace for journalists to remark that the Government were worried people would not comply with a long period of lockdown, hence the delay.  Ifyou accept this, the Government’s indecisiveness may be said to proceed not from their own weakness but from the poor character of the electorate – as perceived by them. In fact the overwhelming majority of the public behaved very well.  How many of them are aware that this was contrary to their Government’s expectations, I don’t know, but it’s surely unlikely to have gone down well with those who picked up on it.  Exaggerated sense of their own competence/the public’s respect for them When Boris Johnson was in hospital and Health Secretary Matt Hancock was self-isolating, I noticed ministers solemnly informing us that ‘the virus doesn’t discriminate.’ Michael Gove was one of these. Whoever would think it did? As though the virus would say to itself, Well, Iwon’t go anywhere near members of the Tory Cabinet, they’re far too special and important. To even make Gove’s comment out loud, you must think you belong to a special and important group, and that other people naturally think so too.  On Good Friday (10th April), the night after Johnson had been moved out of intensive care, his father, in an interview on Radio 4, absurdly said that his son having the virus had served a purpose in getting people to take it seriously.  These two attitudes plainly stem from the same fundamental core of self-conceit.  My reading of the situation was that sympathy for the PM was paper thin with most people, and any attempt to exploit his illness to obscure uncomfortable truths about his handling of the crisis was likely to backfire.  The front page of that day’s Sun read: ‘Boris Is Out (Now that really is a Good Friday!)’ and claimed that his leaving intensive care was ‘delivering a huge boost to the nation’s morale ahead of the crucial Easter period in the coronavirus battle’.  Thenotion that his health was key to the mental well-being of the country was tone-deaf and propagandist, and coming at a time when more people than ever were ‘seeing through’ him, I would have thought self-defeating. Distraction techniques A weird phenomenon of lockdown was the sentimental, almost hysterical, popularity of Tom Moore, a 99 year old, who undertook to walk 100 laps of his garden before he reached his milestone birthday.  This was to raise funds for the NHS, and he eventually collected over £30 million, as well as releasing an egregious duet of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ with Michael Ball.  He seems to have left the army at the end of World War Two, but was described everywhere as ‘Captain Tom’ and an ‘army veteran’ rather than the ‘ex-managing director of a concrete company,’ which according to Wikipedia is what he did afterwards.  As of 20th April, 850,000 people had signed an online petition to upgrade him to Sir Tom.  On his birthday (30th April), the Queen promoted him to honorary colonel of the regiment he’d left three quarters of a century previously.  Permission for a celebratory flypast by a Spitfire had originally been turned down on the grounds of inessentiality; then the Government, seeing the possibilities of some beneficial feel-good publicity, changed their minds, and Boris Johnson filmed a congratulatory message.  Their technique is to identify something the public already likes, and then jump on the bandwagon.  On 20th May, it was announced that Colonel Tom was to become Sir Tom. The broadcaster Stig Abell commented on Twitter: ‘It is totally deserved, of course, but it does feel that promoting Tom Moore might have become a displacement activity forgovernment.’  Of the replies, many agreed with him, but some complained of negative media coverage.  One person said, ‘I think this tweet is beneath you.  Why can’t we just celebrate the recognition and not try to imply some ulterior motive?’  The incapacity of some people to see the blindingly obvious amazes me. Why are they so content to take things at face value and not question them? However, given that this is so, it is obviously worth the Government’s time to pursue a policy of deliberate distraction.  Another example was the minute’s silence for ‘key worker heroes’ at eleven am on 28th April.  This was heavily promoted and propagandized beforehand by the news saying things like, ‘At eleven o’clock this morning, people across the country are expected to fall silent to show their gratitude and respect for blah blah blah.’ That was the day Boris Johnson returned to work, and it was certainly no coincidence the Government waited until then: the initiative was obviously designed to benefit him politically. I asked myself at the time, Why even do it now – in the midst of the crisis? To be brutally frank, the key workers hadn’t finished dying.  They didn’t start doing the two minutes’ silence halfway through the First World War – they waited until the first anniversary of its official end. My theory was that it was purely to give us plebs something positive to focus on. We were to fall silent for those who had died instead of asking about the Government's cutting of funds to the NHS, which would have contributed to those deaths.  Pious silence prevents difficult questions, as a Second World War poster might have put it. Attempts at news management On Easter Monday (13th April), it was hard to avoid Boris Johnson’s video statement after leaving hospital in which he thanked NHS staff and specifically singled out two nurses (one Kiwi, one Portuguese, which was a nice opportunity to give two fingers to the anti-Brexiteers who accused their opponents of being racist) for watching over him through the night, making sure he kept breathing.  A reporter on Good Morning Britain actually said that ‘some are referring to them as Boris’s angels.’  This personal angle, deliberately tossed to the papers, would give them scope for distracting sentimental stories about individuals rather than looking at the larger issues (such as the underfunding of the NHS) for which the Government ought to be held accountable. The GMB reporter also said that some people might find it inspirational how quickly the Prime Minister had recovered from the virus.  The media can be so unbelievably docile and unreflective: that would have been the exact message his PR team wanted putting out. When I saw the video, in which two or three days after being in intensive care, Johnson was wearing a suit and tie, I thought, in what sort of mad world is that considered appropriate dress for someone who recently almost died?  But it was all about projecting power and control, and trying to make us believe that there had not been a break in his authority.  He could have been wearing the suit over his pyjamas; it didn’t matter.  He read the speech theygave him, went to Chequers and got into bed – where even the GMB reporter said he was likely to be recuperating for the next two weeks and possibly longer.  So the ‘inspirational’ nature of his recovery was a sham because he was still recovering and would be for some time yet.  (GMB was far from the only media outlet to fall for this; they were the rule rather than the exception.) When Johnson went back inside after making his Downing Street comeback speech on Monday 27th April, the BBC camera zoomed in on the Thank You, NHS pictures stuck in the window of Number Ten.  I groaned and rolled my eyes.  Again, that was why his PR team put them there, so that they could be picked up by the news, and a subliminal message of a caring administration transmitted to the television audience. Given Johnson’s dubious track record with marital infidelity and unacknowledged children, who were we meant to imagine had produced these pictures? Inability to admit mistakes At the Wednesday 10th June press briefing, unusually headed by the PM because he had some more easing measures to announce, I saw not for the first time a journalist trying to get him to admit the Government had not got everything right.  (The Swedish approach was to take a light touch to lockdown, with poor results, although not as poor as ours; their PM recently acknowledged that mistakes were made, as has Emmanuel Macron of France.)  But Johnson, and also Matt Hancock, continue to insist either that all decisions were the right ones made at the right time, or that now is not the time to look at this. I said to my brother on the phone that the journalist, knowing he was going to get the same bland defensive answer as the others who asked the same question, should have said instead, ‘Of all the things you’ve done right to tackle the pandemic, which is your favourite?’  The sarcastic, implicitly derisive element of this might have flummoxed Johnson (many things seem to), and even if it hadn’t, would have made clear the contempt the public feel at the Government’s refusal to admit any fallibility.  The Cummings scandal This erupted on Saturday 23rd May when both the Guardian and Daily Mirror reported that Johnson’s senior political advisor Dominic Cummings (widely seen as the brains behind the throne) had broken the Government’s lockdown rules.  He and his wife had driven from London to Durham in case they both became ill and needed help with childcare from family members.  I remembered a couple of months previously the news reporting he had coronavirus symptoms, but the explanation for his conduct now involved his wife being ill and him doing the driving.  There were immediate widespread calls for his resignation and public anger built rapidly over the weekend.  (Forget Stanley Johnson’s silly theory that his son’s illness communicated the seriousness of the virus to those who don’t normally pay attention; this story genuinely cut through like no other aspect of the crisis.)  The public immediately saw that Cummings had acted contrary to the guidelines (which he would have had a hand in drawing up).  However the Government chose to stand by him, and damagingly re­explained their own rules in an attempt to clear him.  Senior ministers such as Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock said that Cummings hadn’t done anything wrong, either ethically or legally, and emphasized the size and newness of his kid (it was small, it was young, it was a toddler) and his anxiety as a ‘good father’, i.e.: tryingto pull at the heartstrings of the nation’s parents.  Then the Mirror released a further story about a second journey he’d taken to a Durham beauty spot to enjoy the bluebells.  People furiously complained that they hadn’t visited dying relatives in their last days because the Government had asked them to hold off for the country’s benefit, and still Johnson – presumably frightened of having to manage without instruction – clung to his advisor. On Sunday 24th May, he stepped in to chair the press conference at the last moment, and threw his support behind Cummings, saying he was satisfied his aide had acted with integrity.  Several scientists, who had advised on lockdown measures, said publicly that the Government had trashed their own policies, and made uncertain the public’s loyalty to any future changes.  On Monday even the Daily Mail said Cummings should go, which must have been an unpleasant shock for the Tories, the Mail being a barometer of their middle England demographic.  The BBC1 morning news showed Cummings being hounded by press photographers as he got into his car (a situation he would previously have happily engineered for his political enemies).  More and more Conservative backbenchers, their inboxes swamped with angry emails from constituents, were calling for him to go.  Expecting others to swallow his views on integrity when he has none himself, was not the only aspect of the scandal to set Johnson’s Achilles heel throbbing.  He should have enough political sense not to make pronouncements on parental responsibility; and yet Cummings was, he said, ‘simply following the instincts of every father.’  For me that was the most offensive development to date, since it manifested such a jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness, of arrogant obliviousness to his own wretched morality (Johnson refuses to confirm how many children he’s got or whether he’s involved in all their lives).  In a highly unusual move for a political aide, Cummings gave a press conference on Monday afternoon (for which, with diva-like contempt, he was thirty minutes late).  He claimed that the second trip, to Barnard Castle, was undertaken to check whether he was in a fit state to drive back to London the next day.  Apparently one of his possible coronavirus symptoms was blurred eyesight, so he took a sixty mile test drive (to and from) with his wife and four year old, and sat on a bench by the river for fifteen minutes when theygot there.  And then only because he ‘felt sick’, he said.  Even Laura Kuenssberg on the ten o’clock news qualified this explanation with ‘supposedly.’  It was soon pointed out that the trip was on his wife’s birthday.  More Government figures spoke up for him: Lady (previously Nicky) Morgan affected to see all this as ‘a very human explanation’ and said that some people would never be satisfied.  Myopinion was that he should have just admitted wanting a day out. A burst of honesty, even if only partial and at such a late stage, would have been far more ‘human’ than such obviously cooked-up nonsense.  In the days following, I saw or heard on more than one discussion programme a theory that Cummings was being hounded by the enemies of Brexit.  By discrediting him, these enemies (‘Remoaners’) were really hoping to discredit and then delay the Brexit project.  Initially it came from right-wing panellists (an ex-Brexit party candidate, a Daily Express columnist), but by day two a member of the public phoned to give it as her opinion.  I got a strong sense of briefing behind the scenes, on agreement on this as a way of shutting down the story.  It said that if you voted remain and were incensed by Cummings’ behaviour, your feelings were not legitimate and were actually part of a conspiracy theory.  It never rang true for me: I think people had enough to be angry about over his trips to Durham and the illegitimate explanations for them without worrying about his previous track record.  Possibly the most damaging aspect of the situation for Johnson was that as many people were now laughing at Cummings (and by extension the shambles of the Tory Government) as were furious with him.  Many people combined the two.  A Machiavelli cannot also be a figure of fun, and the eye test explanation was a gift for jokers everywhere.  Trip Advisor suspended new reviews on Barnard Castle because people were swamping them with satirical versions (‘a site for sore eyes’).  Various memes circulated on Twitter, such as a photograph of a van in motion, and written on the back, ‘This journey has been approved by Dominic Cummings.  Eye test in progress.’  In the Guardian Marina Hyde compared Johnson minus his adviser to David Hasselhoff’s character in Knight Rider without his talking car telling him what to do.  The front page of the Daily Star (27th May) featured a cut out and keep Cummings face mask: ‘Free: Do whatever you want and sod everyone else mask. Can’t be arsed to stick to the rules like the rest of us?  Simply wear this handy Dom face covering and you’ll get away with murder.’ More seriously, an opinion poll in the Daily Mail found that 66% of Conservative voters wanted Cummings sacked.  By Thursday 28th May, 61 Tory backbenchers publicly agreed.  A minister told Laura Kuenssberg off the record that he was aghast at the Prime Minister’s willingness to burn through his political capital to save his aide.  West Midlands police noted an increase in ‘pushback’ from all generations when they spoke to people about lockdown infringements.  Several bishops criticized the Government for their lack of moral authority.  On the first Saturday of the scandal, I noted in my coronavirus diary, ‘Although Iwould like to be proved wrong, my prediction is that he won’t resign, and that even if he does, he will return.’  My prediction so far has been correct. The main thrust of the public’s objection to Cummings’ behaviour and the Cabinet’s support of him has been, ‘Huh, it’s one rulefor them and another for the rest of us.’  It occurs to me that Johnson et al struggled because that is an equation so fundamental and obvious to their view of the world and themselves, that when others feel the need to say it out loud, it strikes them as bizarre and elaborately unnecessary.  (‘Of course those of us in charge may behave as we choose; that is one of the benefits of being in charge.’) This left them in a hole when the best, most obvious solution would have been to disavow this way of thinking.  It rapidly became too late to convince the public otherwise.  All they can hope is that by the next election, voters will have forgotten.  It will be interesting to see how this pans out for them; it’s undeniably agamble, and one I hope doesn’t pay off.   Lying The Government were not above lying.  This is a difficult term in politics, since we are used to statistics selectively employed to reinforce particular positions, aspirations passed off as solid facts, empty assurances, comforting exaggerations, etc.  However, Matt Hancock has spoken of a ‘protective ring’ being thrown around care homes to protect vulnerable occupants when we know the opposite was true: there was a policy of untested hospital patients being discharged into such places.  Beds were reserved expressly for this purpose.  Some care home managers have given interviews about the pressure put on them when they refused to co-operate.  If I had any faith in the efficacy and dynamism of a future public enquiry, I would characterize this as a time bomb under more than one Cabinet member’s chair.       Has the Government done anything right? Of course: two examples which come to mind are the suspension of train company franchises for six months with the Government helping them financially so that limited services could still be offered; and the Chancellor’s furlough scheme whereby 80% of the salaries of those unable to work from home were paid by the Government. ‘Apparent success’ vs. a cold shower of overseas opinion During his comeback speech after recuperating from Covid-19, Boris Johnson talked about other countries looking at Britain’s ‘apparent success’ in managing the virus.  The implication was that they would either be envious or intending to copy our strategies.  I would say that if you can only characterize a success as an ‘apparent’ one, then it’s not worth reaching for the term in the first place.  Seven days later, on Monday 4th May, it was announced that coronavirus was listed on the death certificates of more than 32,000 patients – the highest figure in Europe.  Later that week, I read an interesting article in the Guardian (‘Complacent UK draws global criticism for Covid-19 response’), arguing that the rest of the world was appalled by the mess Johnson’s Government was making.  It quoted the opinion of an Italian newspaper (Corriere della Serra): ‘like a nightmare from which you cannot awake, but in which you landed because of your own fault or stupidity.’  Ethnos, a Greek newspaper called Johnson ‘more dangerous than coronavirus.’ The Irish News wrote: ‘Ministers of slim talent have bumbled through daily briefings and now big business-Conservative donors are impatient to reverse a shutdown so contrary to Brexiteer dreams.’  Scott Morrison, the Australian P.M. called the early herd immunity policy ‘a death sentence.’  A former Australian high commissioner to Britain condemned ‘a shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn’t happen here.’  That wasn’t the first time I’d come across such criticism: the political journalist Ian Dunt said on Twitter that whenever he came into professional contact with experts from other countries, whether they were right-or left-wing, all were equally incredulous at Britain’s incompetence. What steps will the Government take over the next few months? Heavy hints are currently being dropped (as we approach the end of June) that social distancing will be reduced to one metre.  Inevitably this will happen, since the hospitality industry cannot hope to survive without it.  Nor will schools be able to fully reopen.  The Government will continue with its apparent random and unconnected measures to loosen lockdown.  Their eye seems drawn to anything which might be popular and – they hope – occasion little kickback, e.g.: zoos and safari parks opening again.  They will continue to manoeuvre their scientific advisers into fall guy positions ready for the public enquiry.  They will admit of no mistakes in their response to the crisis.  The right-wing media will come back on board to prop them up.  If the popularity of the new Labour leader Keir Starmer continues to build, and that of the wounded Johnson to fall, then we may be looking at a new Conservative PM – but not quite yet, not this year.  (If Johnson gets kiboshed, it will be interesting to see whether the Telegraph would have him back as a £250,000 a year columnist; I assume not.)    News My primary source for news is the radio news, Radio 2 and 4.  I usually listen to the last hour of JeremyVine’s lunchtime phone-in on Radio 2; his discussion topics for the last three months have been mostly to do with the virus.  I have also watched the Channel 4 and BBC television news.  I read the Guardian online, but Twitter is probably the online source I check most.  Twitter accounts I look at regularly include those of the political commentator Ian Dunt, the academic Sarah Churchwell, Marina Hyde and other Guardian writers, the Front Row presenter Stig Abell, the broadcaster James O’Brien, and political journalists Tom Peck (The Independent) and Michael Deacon (The Telegraph). I then sometimes go onto the accounts of people whose views they’ve retweeted.  (I’m aware of the theory that we mostlyutilize social media as an echo chamber for our own opinions; these accounts are mostly within the lefty-liberal bubble. In fact I don’t look at Stig Abell’s as much since I found out he used to edit The Sun.) The ‘Trending on Twitter’ sidebar is a good wayof keeping tabs on the issues currently agitating users (who are somewhat representative of the country at large). Although I ‘knew’ that Twitter was not authoritative, and that I should really be seeing it as a source of entertainment, contrary outrage and detail neglected by the traditional media, I still had to learn this lesson.  On 29th April, I emailed N. and said crossly (based on what I’d read there): ‘I was surprised to hear this morning that Boris Johnson’s fiancée has had their baby already. I thought it was months awayyet… It all becomes clear why he rushed back to work [after being hospitalized for Covid-19] and was putting himself about on television in the last couple of days. He’s now on a fortnight’s paternity leave, so he had to show his face between the two bouts of absence otherwise people would have complained even more about his lack of leadership (which they’re doing in any case.) I know he’s entitled to take the leave, but did it ever cross his mind, do you think, to postpone it? Or did he just think, Ooh, brilliant, I can put my feet up for two weeks now. He himself has described the current crisis as the greatest this country has faced since WW2. Wouldn’t a decent leader understand that certain sacrifices are expected of him? And does anyone actually think he’ll be changing nappies or painting the nursery?’ Later on, having checked"

I have decided to start it up again – perhaps with not the enthusiasm or detail as before. Part 1 – 24th March 2020 I’ve had a quick look back into my diary till the beginning of the year and the first mention I can find of the coronavirus was on 31st January when I mentioned that there had been the first two cases confirmed in England. I must have been aware of it before then as I am an avid watcher of the BBC News but can’t have thought it to be of any real threat to us here in the UK. Of much more importance that day was the fact that the UK left the EU – “no cause for celebration” was my comment as I had hoped right until the last minute that it wouldn’t happen. I think the next few weeks were taken up with Storms Ciara, Dennis, Harry & Meghan leaving the Royal Family, family issues etc and the next mention I made was on 25th February about South Korea and Italy being badly hit and people quarantined in Tenerife after an Italian tourist had been confirmed as having the virus. I’maware that people had also been quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan but I think it all seemed pretty remote. About that date, things like hand gel started to become difficult to get but I managed to get a couple that day – I use it as a matter of course anyway. My next comment was on 2nd March to say the first Scottish case had been confirmed in Tayside – they had been to northern Italy like most of the other UK victims. Still OK as it still seemed at a distance as I don’t travel abroad at all and am mostly within the Lothians and Borders areas. Also that day, I had a call from my 95 year old uncle in Clevedon near Bristol. His son and family had been skiing in northern Italy…. – they’d been back for 10 days and all seemed well. I think I was more worried than he was! He’s a very fit 95 year old, both physically and mentally but it was starting to appear that the elderly were more at risk. By 5th March, Scotland had 6 cases – all connected – and still none in the Lothians. Friends and family had now stopped booking holidays, long weekends etc and on 8th March, the Lothians had its first 2 cases. In Italy, over 16m –a quarter of the population had been quarantined with over 360 dead! It was all starting to get a bit scary. Boris Johnson gave a major briefing and was speaking about over 70s and people with underlying health problems being more at risk and on the 11th there were 36 cases in Scotland and 8 in the Lothians. By now, the shops had become unbearable – for some reason, toilet rolls were flying off the shelves – you’d have thought it was the norovirus! Also pasta, rice, tinned foods, eggs etc etc were becoming more and more difficult to get hold of and in some places, fights were breaking out over packs of toilet rolls! All weekend (14th & 15th March) and going forward, there have been queues of people waiting for shops to open and all sorts of restrictions have now been placed by the major supermarkets on the number of each grocery item that can be bought. Most of them have set aside an hour every so often for over 70s and at risk people to shop without having to fight through the hordes of people just going crazy and buying everything in sight. On 16th March, Boris Johnson announced that over 70s and the “at risk”groups should self-isolate although Nicola Sturgeon says that we should practice “social distancing” which gives a little more freedom. And that’s the story so far on 18th March 2020! I have decided to have no face to face contact with any friends or relatives but go out in my car and stop somewhere on the coast to have a walk, only passing others now and again –at a distance. I am fortunate that I can have regular contact by phone and e-mail but it will be a big change. I am a very sociable person and a member of several groups, volunteer with a mental health charity and meet regularly with friends and family – all that has stopped and everything I did has closed down. As regards shopping – well, like my mother did and my sister does, I have always kept a good store cupboard, fridge and freezer. I don’t stock-pile but very rarely run out of anything. Living on my own, I tend to cook and bake in batches and like a variety of dishes to choose from so usually have chilli con carne, Bolognese sauce, lamb curry, beef stew, stewed mince and homemade soups in the freezer. I also have tinned meat, beans, veg, fruit etc in the cupboard and all the necessary cleaning products, toilet & kitchen rolls etc that I need. If you live on your own, you need to do this if at all possible. It was really brought to home to me when I broke my foot six years ago and couldn’t get out for weeks. I hate depending on others to do my shopping although both my son and daughter live within 10 minutes of me. I also have a cat and always keep stocks of cat food and cat litter – along with seed, fat balls and peanuts for the many wild birds that visit my bird feeders. Also very important for me is to make sure I always have reasonable supplies of any medicines that I need if I am confined to the house for any length of time. I am very relieved that I have done so as things like paracetamol are virtually impossible to get hold of at the moment and I suffer from arthritis in my hands and have cervical spondylosis at the top of my spine. Due to the threat of shortages due to Brexit earlier this year, I had upped my stores a little so I feel at the moment I am well stocked without having to go out and join the many thousands who are panic buying. Just before I self-isolated earlier this week, I went into a couple of supermarkets looking for a couple of things and some of the aisles are just stripped bare. My main problem will be getting fresh fruit and vegetables I think. I have some frozen and tinned vegetables and some tinned fruit but may need to try to stock up now and again. I use soya milk and only on my cereal but have several cartons of the long life stuff so I should be OK. If I run out, I can have porridge made with water. I looked at the Tesco online grocery website this morning – 20th March – and both the delivery and “click & collect” slots go up to 9th April and are fully booked – absolutely crazy! Some of the TV pictures of people stripping the shelves in the major supermarkets are horrendous – some of the people are like animals. AtanEdinburghSainsbury’sstore, ayoungcouplehad comeintothestoreand started stuffing uncooked chickens and any other meat they could get hold of into 2 big suitcases! Fortunately they were seen by a member of staff who reported it to the manager and made them return the food to the shelves. (Edinburgh Evening News, Friday 20th March 2020) There has been a heart-wrenching video on the BBC of a critical care nurse in tears, just finisheda48hrshift whocouldn’t get any freshfruitorveginherlocal supermarket, pleading with everyone to stop panic buying – extremely emotional. My daughter works in the Finance Department of a Scottish council and although she has the ability to work from home, has not yet been given permission to do so. This is quite worrying as several workers in her large open plan office have already come down with the classic symptoms of the virus but have not been hospitalised so have not been tested. The lack of testing seems to be the one of the biggest issues at the moment – testing is only being done in hospitals if you are so ill to get taken there. Another major issue is what appears to be the lack of vital equipment – ventilators and personal protective equipment in particular. The government is working on it but the lack of it is one of the main reasons for the measures being taken to slow down the peak of the pandemic. I mainly get my information from the BBC. I’m not on any social media and amglad as there seems to be so many false rumours coming from them. I have not been a fan of either Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon in the past but I think both of them have responded and acted very responsibly. There are slight differences between NHS England and NHS Scotland but in the main, I think they are all pulling together. Well it’s now Tuesday 24th March and more severe restrictions were announced at 8.30pm last night. You can now only go out for essential food and medicines, once a day for exercise (walking/running/cycling), to help someone sick or elderly and for work but it should only be essential work that cannot be done at home. It all seems very surreal – just a few weeks ago, life was “normal”. I am lucky in so much that I have everything I need at the moment – will run out of fresh fruit and veg eventually – but lack of human contact and lack of incentive is starting to kick in a little. I have phone conversations several times a day so I am very, very luck in that respect but today is the first time I’ve felt a little emotional. I know that many people with mental health issues are really struggling and I have offered to make phone calls to clients of the mental health charity that I volunteer for. I have been told that this is not currently possible (probably due to data protection issues) but I hope this will eventually be allowed as a little chat – perhaps weekly – would I’m sure be of real help to our clients. Mother’s Day was on Sunday. Both my son and daughter came to see me – from outside! They left their gifts on the doorstep and we chatted for a few minutes about 12 feet apart. We chat on the phone regularly – my daughter in particular sometimes calls several times a day. I went out walking for an hour or so on Thursday, Friday and Saturday last week but in some places there were crowds of people. I gardened most of the day on Sunday but haven’t done anything apart from some gentle exercise in the house since then. I had to go out in the car yesterday. My little 15 year old cat has to get her claws clipped every three months or they curl into her pads and I heard her clip-clopping on the floor on Sunday and realised it was time for her to go to the vet. I called them and they said to park outside and they would collect her cat basket from the car and return it when they had treated her. I was a bit worried as I always take her in and hold her while her claws are being clipped but all went very well and she didn’t seem to mind her Mummy not being with her! I called the vet on returning home and paid the bill by card so didn’t have togo anywhere near anyone. I anti-bac wiped her cat basket down when I got home before I put it away. I called my 95 year old uncle last night and he still very well – just fed up. He’s been gardening a lot and had a visit from his son and daughter-in-law at the weekend who brought their own mugs to have a distant coffee! They were both pharmacists before they retired and suddenly realised there was an issue with the milk and sugar so have decided next time to bring a flask so that they don’t have to touch anything that may infect him! I have a friend in his mid 70s who lives alone. He is highly intelligent but slightly autistic and has difficulty with social situations. He is English and lived most of his life there before moving to Skye and then to the Scottish Borders about 6 or 7 years ago. He lives about 35 miles from me but I meet up with him fairly regularly and have encouraged him over the years to join in with things in his local area. He has built up a little circle of “friends” – but very much on his terms – often backing out of things at the last minute. Unfortunately this has knocked him for six and he is starting to panic in case he is banned from leaving his house – he says if that happened, he would go into his car, turn the engine on and kill himself! I have to speak to him every evening on the phone to try to talk him through things and reassure him and find it all extremely stressful. He has a grown-up son and daughter who live a fair bit away from him – they both visit infrequently and are also both extremely intelligent but also autistic anddon’t seem to realise he has issues – probably too busy coping with their own. I have no contact number for them and do worry in case I don’t hear from him for a few days. Part 2 – 27th August 2020 It’s now August 27th and the last time I wrote was on 24th March! Very strange really as in one way it seems like yesterday but in another it seems much more than five months ago. I think it’s because each day really seems very much like the one before and although nothing much seems to happen, life goes on. A lot has happened though – too many people have died and too many people have been very unwell and there seems to be no end to it all at present. Each day more figures and at the moment they seem to be increasing again. In the first few months during lockdown I felt that I was coping really well – the weather was fantastic, I went out for my hour’s daily walk enjoying nature and spent most of the rest of the time working in the garden. The places I went walking were peaceful, quiet and beautiful and I only met the occasional walker. Then – all of a sudden there was an absolute invasion of cyclists from other parts of the country (never mind the 5 mile limit on travel) who raced past almost knocking me over. They came in groups of a dozen or so from cycling clubs paying no attention whatsoever to social distancing, shouting to each other and whizzing past me on dirt paths as well as cycle/pedestrian paths. Then everyone seemed to get a bike –some wobbling by and falling off at times – and my walks ceased to be an enjoyment. I had to try to find other routes and eventually the only places I could find to walk safely were in the middle of housing estates because all the inhabitants had gone out on their bikes – crazy!!! So a couple of months ago I stopped going for a walk. I may start up again as the children are now back at school and things may be a bit quieter but the enthusiasm seems to have left me. As I live alone, am retired and have no grandchildren, my life has changed little apart from the fact that I spend more time at home and rarely actually see people I would normally see. Friends who regularly see their grandchildren seem to be finding it really difficult. I probably don’t feel as well mentally as I did at the beginning but I know I always feel worse as autumn and winter come along – I loathe the dark nights when the curtains are drawn by 4ish and not open again till 9ish the next morning. I seem to have totally lost motivation to do anything apart from my normal housework and garden. I am a member of the U3A and most of our groups came to an abrupt end. The only one still running that I’m involved in is Latin which we do once a month on Zoom. Since lockdown I joined both Zoom and Skype so have had a few conversations on Skype with an elderly couple I know who I usually visit regularly – it’s great to see themeven if it’s just on my laptop. I used to meet up with my ex-work colleagues fairly regularly – we all got on really very well although they are all in their 40s and into social media so my ex-boss suggested I join Facebook to see what they’re all up to. I don’t really do much on it but enjoy seeing them and hearing from them. My daughter phones me every day – at least once – but we usually end up arguing which upsets me. She criticises everything I say and sometimes I just wish she wouldn’t phone. She lives on her own too and all her friends are work colleagues so she’s missing the companionship. She’s met up with a few of them lately – socially distanced of course – but I know how lonely living on your own can be at times. My son and his partner of almost 24 years are on the verge of splitting up – she had been cheating on him off and on for over a year with someone at her work! He was pretty devastated at first but is now coming to terms with it –they are still living together in their flat but not communicating – very difficult. Fortunately, both of them have been working throughout – she works in a bakery and he in a fish distributors –it could have been very uncomfortable if they’d both been stuck at home. Or maybe things would have been different had Covid not happened as they may have been able to work things out. They have always gone on several holidays each year with weekends away too. Their hobbies revolved around football and walking but the football stopped and their walks were restricted. I had a bit of a health scare in May – I found a lump in my breast one Thursday night. I phoned my GP’s surgery at 8am on the Friday and was home again after having seen a GP by 9am! She thought it was OK but said she’d like it checked at the Breast Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. She assured me that it was very safe there and she would mark it as urgent. I received a call from them on the Monday giving me an appointment on the Friday that week – so within one week I had been seen by a consultant. Very fortunately, all was well – I had several mammograms and an ultra sound and several cysts were found. They checked the results with my previous routine mammogram done in September 2018 and nothing had changed so I have to have another one done in 3 years’ time. Naturally I was extremely relieved and very impressed withthe service Ireceivedboth at the GP’ssurgery andthe Breast Unit. My temperature was taken as I arrived, seating in the waiting areas was socially distanced and you could see the staff changing their PPE and washing their hands after each patient. In fact, I felt safer there than going to Tesco’s! It was a “New Patient” clinic and the receptionist said that contrary to the stories in the media, their unit had been just as busy as it always was. At the beginning, I tried to get Tesco online grocery deliveries but the slots were all taken up in no time so I gave up. I go food shopping – mainly to Tesco – once every 7-10 days. At first it worked really well as every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 9-10am was reserved for the elderly and disabled with a member of staff sanitising the trolley and basket handles, directing customers etc. They’ve now stopped that and you have to just muck in with everyone else. It’s so much busier now at that time of the morning as a lot of mothers go there after dropping their kids off at school and make no attempt to socially distance etc. My cooking habits haven’t really changed and apart from flour at one point, I didn’t have any problem buying what I needed. However, I must have been eating more as I have put on half a stone in weight. This is probably due partly to less exercise but mainly due to more snacking as I have been in the house more. Normally I’d be out having coffees, scones, lunches etc but I’d be moving about more and out with my walking group regularly. I’ve definitely watched more “rubbish” television. At the beginning I waded throughthe complete box sets of Downton Abbey but since then have ditched DVDs for TV – it’s easier and I’ve got lazier! However a lot of the time I just turn off the TV and perhaps knit or read if I can’t go out into the garden. I plan to paint all my outside window sills as the frames are fine but the sills are starting to flake – I wish I’d done it earlier when the weather was drier. My hut also needs repainting so I hope to get them all seen to before the winter sets in. I’ve got fed up watching the news as it’s the same old stuff hour after hour, day after day. I tend to watch the news at 6pm then maybe check it out on my laptop at different times during the day. At the beginning, it seemed as if everyone was pulling together but now all the media – TV and especially newspapers – are ripping apart the people running the country. They are only human and trying to cope with an unprecedented situation to the best of their abilities. They have and will have to continue to make really difficult decisions for a considerable period of time that could never have been imagined at the beginning of 2020.  The next few years – maybe even decades – will be really hard as the economy has been very badly hit – and it’s not over yet by any means. We are nowhere near the end of this pandemic and does another one lie in the future? A lot of really difficult welfare funding decisions will have to be made and where will the money come from? I think Nicola Sturgeon has behaved impeccably throughout and totally outshone the UK government – and I am definitely not an SNP or independence voter. Her briefings have been clear and concise and she has not been afraid to accept liability or mistakes whereas the UK government always seem to be fudging one issue or another. She and her team are always well prepared and presented unlike the UK team who often look as if they are uncomfortable at being there and have just dragged themselves out of bed. She answers all questions from the media knowledgeably without the humming and hawing that comes from the UK government. If she doesn’t know the answer, she’ll say she will get back to them – and she does. I don’t think my personal hygiene habits have changed all that much. My hair grew considerably longer during lockdown – I had it cut on 21st January and it wasn’t cut again until 22nd August. After comments from family and friends that it looked better and less severe, I decided to just get it trimmed and keep it longer. I’m always pretty paranoid about washing my hands at the best of times so just upped it ever so slightly. I’ve hardly worn make-up – twice I think since lockdown – what’s the point with a face mask on? I think I’ve only “dressed up” twice since lockdown and lived in house, garden or walking clothes. I don’t think my sleep has been much worse than usual. For the past 20 years now, I’ve suffered from bad night sweats – apparently fairly common for post-menopausal women. This means I can wake several times a night – I get up to the loo to cool down then go back to bed. Most nights I can get to sleep fairly easy both on first going to bed and when I get up during the night. Although I’ve been retired for 5 years now, I still wake early and normally get up between 7 and 8am then go to bed between 10.30 and11pm. Sometimes I’maware of my dreams but they’re quickly forgotten and luckily I don’t seem to get many nightmares."

We both have really appreciated the lack of the usual interruptions. No social outings etc. I realised I had a deep longing for such time.TechnologyGreat help BUT as I have enjoyed the uninterrupted time, I have avoided filling the time by using much technology to be in touch with people. Dislike Zoom, just makes me aware what I'm missing not being with people and I don't like it. I understand it good for some work situations. Phone and emails and FaceTime I use for friends and family.Shopping and foodWe have been very fortunate. Local Farm shop providing weekly home deliveries for over 70 living within five miles. Supply fresh fruit, vegetables, diary, meat, some dry goods and bread. Also local Health food store delivers: need to spend £50 so used once every three weeks. PLUS have wonderful neighbours who checks up weekly to see if we need anything. Food and cooking have an added importance, meal times marking the day. We have also enjoyed better quality food. Haven't had food from a supermarket for months. Haven't been into a shop of any kind for 12 weeks.This week, June 15, went to an open air fruit and veg stall, was like going to the best sweet shop ever!Entertainment and Leisure, All home grown, in that we have a garden and the weather has been good and always lots to do.

Not going to hairdresser has allowed me to let my hair grow longer which has been fun. Maybe worn less make-upSleepHasn't been an issue.

Mass Obs Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: COVID-19 Health On the mental health front, I live on my own and have a history of anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and somewhat disordered eating habits. I was already a hypochondriac and germaphobe. The pandemic has inevitably made my anxiety worse, by essentially vindicating the most paranoid parts of my brain. I've been in a constant state of fear since about a month before lockdown began. In the first few weeks of lockdown, I cycled through a variety of symptoms: anxiety attacks, insomnia, crying, tension headaches, intrusive thoughts, difficulty eating, inability to focus, exhaustion, nervous energy, stomach pains & indigestion, constantly clenching my jaw, nightmares, and a sense of constantly being on the edge of panic. Since then things have settled down a bit. More than two months into lockdown, I'm still not sleeping well and having nightmares, but am only getting anxiety attacks rarely. I'm eating three meals a day, although they are sometimes snack-sized. I'm still exhausted most of the time, but have regained some of my focus (when I need it, at least). I still get intrusive thoughts about illness and dying every day and am near-constantly on edge, though. My fear has deepened as covid-19 has spread further, killed more people, and revealed itself to be much more complex and dangerous than a normal respiratory virus. As a result, I have become convinced that my flat is the only safe place in the world and am increasingly scared of going outside, especially for grocery shopping as that's the only time I enter another building. To me this fear seems perfectly rational, however it's clear that my friends and family do not share it to the same extent. It may take a very long time for me to stop thinking of everything outside my front door as a threat. It's hard for me to separate physical and mental health, as the physical problems I've been having seem totally interdependent with my mental state. These consist of recurrent stomach problems, mostly painful cramping, and a bad eczema flare-up. I've had eczema all my life and it hasn't been this bad since I was a small child. All over my legs, lower back, scalp, eyelids, and elbows are extremely dry and itchy sores. If I scratch, which is a constant temptation, they bleed and scab then don't heal. My legs look and feel especially awful, despite my applying emollient twice daily (I've tried various types) and cutting my nails very short. If I could, I'd go to the GP about this, as it seems to be gradually getting worse. Obviously that isn't an option until GPs reopen for non-urgent matters. I haven't required medical or professional help during lockdown. There isn't really anything a doctor could do about my current anxiety, as it's due to the pandemic, and the eczema isn't life-threatening therefore not important. I've been trying out various coping mechanisms, old and new, as well as keeping in touch with friends and family to distract me. My emotions over the last few weeks have been overwhelmingly characterised by fear. I'm afraid of the virus, of the incompetent UK government, of any relaxation of lockdown. I'm afraid for my family, for my friends, and for myself. I'm afraid I'll lose my job, that my job will get much worse, and that I won't be able to get another job. I can't see anything positive about the future and am afraid to think beyond the next couple of days. I'm afraid I'll never recover or be happy ever again. CBT taught me to try and counter these sort of anxious thoughts with more positive alternatives, but I can't do that at the moment. Distracting myself is the best I can manage. I feel momentary joy when I laugh with a friend on a videocall, or read something funny, or see a family of ducklings. Distractions don't last, though. The Government One of the ways I try to keep myself from spiralling into total panic is to pretend that Nicola Sturgeon is prime minister. Despite my attempts at news-avoidance, I saw on twitter that the UK has the worst coronavirus death rate of all countries collecting decent data. Sixty thousand excess deaths! That's so appalling that I can't get my head around it. If the government had even the remotest sense of shame, they would resign en masse and ideally go into exile on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the sea. Delaying the lockdown because of some misconceived notion of 'herd immunity' has killed tens of thousands of people. It nearly killed the Prime Minister, and honestly might have been better if it had. Any hopes that Boris Johnson learned some humility and humanity from his near-death experience have been dashed by the 'Stay Alert' fiasco and his response to the indefensible actions of Dominic Cummings. I simply do not understand what is wrong with the current government ministers. I am extremely glad to live in Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon's government has communicated much more clearly. She has not used war metaphors or the meaningless 'Stay Alert' slogan. The Scottish Government's plan for relaxing lockdown in four phases actually seems sensible and gives assurances of why things will happen and in what order. As a result, my support for Scottish independence has never been stronger. I worry intensely for my family in England, who do not seem to be taking the lockdown seriously enough. The nonsensical mixed messages from Boris et al have confused them. I wish I could spread my anxiety around a little, since I have an excess of it! In the coming months, I expect the UK government will continue on its path of making bad and stupid decisions, resulting in more preventable deaths. I absolutely do not trust Boris Johnson's government to prioritise public health and make evidence-based policy. I suspect England will see a massive second wave of cases and deaths. I can only hope that my loved ones will be OK and that Scotland will have more sensible policies and therefore be safer. News As the pandemic has unfolded, my tolerance for news fell to near zero. In the weeks before lockdown, I couldn't read the news without bursting out crying. I gradually restricted my access: stopped reading liveblogs, then checked news only twice daily, then only once daily, then stopped using twitter, then checked the news for half an hour once a day, then finally stopped reading news websites altogether. I've gone back to using twitter, but have muted or disabled retweets from people who post news more than incidentally. I only follow 50 people, in any case. I can't really cope with the news at all, which makes me feel weak and pathetic. On several occasions reading a news article about coronavirus has given me an anxiety attack. Conversely, it does worry me that I have no idea what's going on outside the UK, or what's happening other than the pandemic. Experience has shown that even small doses of news make me very anxious, though, and there's nothing I can do about these grim tidings other than follow the current precautions. Which I'm already doing. I get the latest developments directly from the Scottish Government website and Nicola Sturgeon's twitter account. I can't avoid seeing trending topics on the twitter sidebar, but try to avoid clicking on links or threads about the pandemic. I haven't watched any of Boris Johnson's broadcasts, as I absolutely cannot stand him. I have watched a few of Nicola Sturgeon's, although I prefer to read her statements afterwards and any new guidance documents. I mainly hear about whatever's going on with the UK government second hand via discussion with my friends and parents. A kind friend who is an epidemiologist has on several occasions tried to reassure me that some terrifying news article was sensationalist and not supported by data. It seems obvious that BSL interpreters should accompany government broadcasts of such critical importance. The fact that the Scottish Government does this and the UK government doesn't is emblematic of their respective attitudes to vulnerable people. Work and home life During lockdown I've been working at home as a university Assistant Professor. When lockdown began, I was still teaching as it was the second term of the academic year. I livestreamed a couple of lectures and tutorials online for students, without having time to change the material to suit this format better. All exams were subsequently cancelled, so I rewrote exam papers to be essays for online submission, as well as marking online rather than using hardcopies. In the initial month or so I was busy, however in recent weeks uncertainty about the next academic year has really sapped my motivation. Without clear decisions from senior management about what and how we're going to teach next year, beginning preparations seems pointless. I'm also struggling to work on a conference paper and journal paper I should be doing, as the research in both is thrown up into the air by the pandemic. The conference I submitted an abstract to will have to be held online, if not cancelled. My university has already warned staff that there's a huge budget shortfall this year and a much larger one next, so there will be some combination of redundancies, pay cuts, and reduced hours. Reliance upon the inflated fees paid by overseas students is proving highly counterproductive. Given that I've been on strike three times in the last two years over pensions, pay, workload, casualisation, and pay inequality, this is all very unencouraging. I'm very glad I can work from home and grateful to have a job at all, given that many aren't so lucky. I don't have space for a proper office setup in my flat, so have my work laptop on the dining table or on my lap on the sofa, then tidy it away at the end of the day. I am definitely not managing a full working week at the moment. In the absence of imminent deadlines and clear priorities, it is hard to focus and easy to get distracted. I do appreciate that online meetings are generally shorter and more focused than their face-to-face equivalents, whether they are with students or colleagues. Supervising student dissertations is working quite well online, although I feel very sorry for current students. Their education this year has been badly disrupted, first by strikes then the pandemic. Working from home does enable me to work around my insomnia -I quite often have an afternoon nap to make up for getting six or fewer hours sleep the night before. I live alone, so my home life has been solitary. I try to ensure that I speak to another human being each day, either a work meeting or call with a loved one. Technology Lockdown has quite significantly changed my relationship with technology. Prior to the pandemic, I deliberately tried to restrict my technology use, by turning off my router for a full day every weekend, using an unsmart phone, and deliberately choosing second-hand devices that were slow to discourage heavy use. I also limited my social media time in various ways. When lockdown began, however, this approach became totally inappropriate. I live alone, so technology became my only way of interacting with other people. As a consequence, I've started using a smart phone, returned to using tumblr, started using whatsapp, bought a new laptop, and stopped my internet-free days. I miss the peace and quiet of breaks from the internet, but they would be too isolating at the moment. I don't want to be left completely alone with my thoughts when they are so uniformly anxious. I have weekly videocalls with my parents and five friends (in four households), as well as weekly Bad Movie Night and less regular calls with at least five other friends and relatives. I mostly use Google Hangouts and Zoom for these. I'd never come across the latter prior to lockdown and have found it quite easy to use. With work colleagues and students, I use Microsoft Teams or Skype. I've even used my landline phone a couple of times, when videocalling didn't work for some reason. Using whatsapp has reconnected me with some old friends, which is good, and I definitely speak to several people more often now than I did prior to the pandemic. Many of my friends and all my family live outside easy visiting distance, so I was already familiar with videocalling pre-lockdown. I find it a good replacement for face-to-face conversation, although it cannot replace the feeling of sharing a meal or most other experiences. In some ways, technology-mediated socialising has made things easier and pleasanter. I don't have to network with strangers or deal with my more tiresome colleagues as much. Students don't barge into my office with questions. It's easier to arrange calls with friends as there's nowhere to go out in the evenings. I find the regular exchange of messages about creatures we've seen, food we've prepared, and craft projects we're working on touching and cheering. I'm fully addicted to whatsapp, which prior to the pandemic I refused to consider using, and exchange daily messages on it with at least three people. It provides a sense of low-key companionship and reassurance that my friends are still OK. I also find that my online socialising preferences are the same as face-to-face. In both cases, I much prefer speaking to one or two people, rather than a larger group. As for social media, I still refuse to use facebook and instagram because I hate them. I use twitter to keep track of some of my friends, although it does have the disadvantage of inevitable news exposure. I wish the trending sidebar could be disabled. I use tumblr for escapism, including pretty pictures, memes, and fandom content. It's easy to avoid the news on there. I use goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. I have a dreamwidth blog but have only posted in it twice since lockdown began. It's hard to resist mindlessly scrolling through social media at the moment, although I consider it a counterproductive distraction. I generally feel calmer when reading a book, however books require greater energy and focus. As the pandemic abates, I intend to reduce my social media and internet time. Social media probably doesn't actually help me feel less anxious, although at times it can appear soothing. Tumblr particularly so, as it's like flicking through a fiction-centric magazine. I am still trying to have a laptop-free evening a week, to give my eyes a bit of a rest. Shopping and food During lockdown I have become increasingly averse to grocery shopping, as it feels like the most dangerous part of my week. Since lockdown started, I've reduced my grocery shopping to one trip a week (or every 8 days, recently). Prior to the pandemic, I didn't do a main shop and would drop into the supermarket three or so times a week on the way back from work. Despite finding grocery shopping anxiety-inducing, I haven't bought any groceries online, for a few reasons. Firstly, I don't need to and many others do -I'm not in a vulnerable group and have multiple supermarkets within walking distance. Secondly, I live alone and don't need to buy more than about £20 of groceries a week. Thirdly, I'm picky about food and couldn't cope with substitutions. I'm lucky that I've mostly been able to buy all the groceries I want, although there were four weeks when the supermarket didn't have any eggs. My eating and cooking habits have changed somewhat during lockdown. Having to prepare all my own meals is tiresome, as I strongly dislike cooking. However, being at home all the time has made me gradually experiment with more cooking and eat fewer packaged snacks. Since lockdown began I've been regularly making my own granola, flapjacks, and roasted vegetables. That doesn't sound like much, but it's more than I was doing before. I've also had several disasters, including a vegan banana bread so bad that it made me feel nauseous and gave me an anxiety attack. I can't tell whether I'm eating better overall, although I think I've put on some weight (which I've been half-heartedly trying to do for more than five years). I don't have scales, but my hip measurement has increased by an inch or two. I am definitely more organised about food and eating more vegetables, though, which are good. Also not eating in cafes is saving me money. I've only got takeaway once during lockdown (cheesy chips from a nearby chip shop), as it doesn't seem worth it without the social aspect and I worry about the possibility of coronavirus transmission. My anxiety sometimes makes eating difficult. I've almost always managed to eat three times a day or more, however this sometimes ends up being at midday, 5pm, and 10pm. It's hard for me to judge appropriate portions, so I usually go to bed hungry and wake up ravenous. I prefer hunger to indigestion and stomach pain; there often seems to be a trade-off between the two. I've still got plenty of tinned food from my brexit stockpile to eat, as my preference has shifted during lockdown to cooking a pile of fresh veg and eating the leftovers for half the week. There are several more simple recipes that I intend to try, however working up the motivation to do so takes time. While I have far fewer distractions now, being on edge all the time makes cooking high risk. In addition to the inedible disasters, during lockdown I've been clumsier and dropped ingredients all over the floor several times. I'm also paranoid about food going off and giving me food poisoning, a pre-existing anxiety that the pandemic has intensified. Entertainment and Leisure I haven't taken up any new hobbies, lacking the energy and concentration. However, I have rediscovered some old hobbies. I knitted a cowl in the first month or so of lockdown. I bought a folding bike at the start of lockdown, intending to cycle regularly, but have only used it a couple of times. I prefer walking, as it allows me to look around more. Since I'm in the same small flat for more than 23 hours a day, just looking around the park feels like a real treat. Spotting local wildlife in green spaces is perhaps the most pleasurable activity I've been doing. I've seen cygnets, goldfinches, herons, bats, and many ducklings within a mile of my home. For indoor exercise, I've tried doing some yoga using youtube videos, usually at around midnight. I would like to get into a regular routine of yoga before bed, but mostly leave it too late and am hungry and/or exhausted. I haven't managed any DIY at all. That would require levels of focus, calm, and confidence that I absolutely do not have at present, not to mention equipment. My main activities have been reading and watching TV and films. I haven't read as many books as I usually would, while still getting through quite a few. I keep track on goodreads and review all books I read there. Since lockdown began, I've finished 27 books. My current preference is strongly in favour of escapism, so most of them were fiction. I've also read reams of fanfiction on Archive of Our Own, as that tends to be lighter and less demanding than professional writing. I'm rewatching my favourite sitcom, Community, and have just finished the 5th series. The last thing I finished watching was series 1 of The Terror, about the loss of the Franklin expedition. That is a dark and depressing series, albeit very good, so I spaced out watching the ten episodes with lighter fare, like She-Ra and Dead To Me. I've caught up on various films I had intended to watch and have been attending an online Bad Movie Night with friends. We stream a movie using the Netflix Party chrome extension and mock it using audio chat on Discord. That's fun. I also have a longstanding arrangement with a friend living 400 miles away whereby we videochat while watching the same superhero TV shows. That has continued unchanged during lockdown, except for the topics of our pre­watching discussion. On my own, I tend to choose what I consider to be escapist and fun films and TV shows. I still have a huge list of unwatched content. Often I surf the internet or play freecell while watching video, as I struggle to fully concentrate without something to do with my hands. Knitting also works. I've got into the habit of always putting subtitles on, as these help me focus. I don't have a TV, so watch things on a laptop using netflix or piracy. I mostly listen to music on spotify or youtube, but have recently rediscovered old mp3s on my backup harddrive. Rather than learning new skills, I'm concerned that my pre-existing skills are atrophying. The only new things I've learned, really, are how to make my own granola and press buttons with my elbows. Personal hygiene My personal hygiene was fairly careless before lockdown, by prevailing female standards. I showered twice a week and didn't remove any body hair or wear makeup, for instance. It has definitely got more careless, though. I wash about as often, but don't change my clothes as frequently. I only get dressed and put deodorant on at lunchtime or later, on some days not changing out of my pyjamas at all. The sniff test is now graded more generously, because nobody is going to get close enough to smell me. I have to spend more time moisturising my skin twice a day now, due to an unpleasant eczema flare-up during lockdown. I've tried out new hairstyles a couple of times, but am mostly ignoring my hair until it gets greasy enough to need washing. I was already growing it, so am personally not bothered by not being able to get a haircut. Several of my friends are impatient for hairdressers to reopen, as they have shorter hair than me. Sleep I am a night owl by nature and working 9 to 5 does not come naturally to me at all. The sleep routine I fall into given the choice is 3-4am to 11-12. During lockdown, I have constantly struggled to go to sleep before 3am. I think I've managed it twice in the past week and can't remember the last time I went to bed before 1:30am. During weekdays, my alarm goes off at 9:30, I drag myself out of bed around 10, drink coffee, feel dozy, and take an hour long nap around 5 or 6pm. I feel most alert between about 8pm and 1am; that tends to be when I go for a walk. At the weekend, I sleep in until about 1pm. About once a week I'm woken up in the middle of the night (morning, technically) by stomach pain, indigestion, or an anxiety attack and take a while to fall asleep again. None of this is pleasant. In better times, I slept 8 to 9 hours every night. My dreams are anxiety-centric at the moment. In the most recent that I recall, I dreamed of going to visit my Nana and Grandad in their old house. They died in 2017 and 2012 respectively and I miss them very much. In the dream, I was initially delighted to see them again, then realised with horror that I could have exposed them to coronavirus and was wracked with guilt. I've been dreaming frequently of being trapped in lifts, prisons, and other confined spaces. My dreams used to be a lot more fun and exciting."

E5551, sex -Male, age -44, marital status -Married, the town where you live -Bristol and your occupation – Operational Management Consultant for an Insurance Company. COVID-19 Pandemic. Life in Lockdown. I’m writing this on 20th April 2020 When people started dying in China, I was wondering why it was such a stubborn news item. My thoughts were that hundreds of thousands of people die every year from seasonal flu across the globe. Weren’t we over-reacting? People at work talked about the threat in a fairly light hearted way. There were a few grumbles about cancelled holidays. We’d seen Italy go into lockdown – a lot of people quite liked the idea of not having to drag themselves into the office 5 times a week. Only vulnerable people were dying, which happens anyway, so why the big panic? I started to research the differences between seasonal flu and COVID-19. The main difference appeared to be the number of unknowns with COVID-19. There’s no vaccine, it spreads quickly and it kills people. As the virus spread across the world, we all accepted that our lives were gradually changing. At work there was a lot of activity to enable people to work from home. Never having worked from home before, this was a novelty for me. Gradually the number of people at the office began to diminish and, in line with government advice, we all said goodbye to normal working life and wondered off home. The previous week a few of us had gone to the pub for a lunchtime pint. This was against guidance but we were all together anyway, so we convinced ourselves we were doing a noble thing in supporting a local business. I felt uneasy though. Already there was a camp of scared people who didn’t want to set foot outside their homes and a faction who resisted making any changes. I didn’t really want to be in either camp. I must admit that it felt like an exciting time to be alive. I don’t consider myself to be high risk so I had little fear – I felt excitement at this bizarre unfolding of a new society. Then panic buying started. We struggled to buy pasta, milk and toilet roll. This eventually calmed down but that was probably the biggest initial impact on my family. Initially we continued with home delivery from Sainsburys. But then they stopped delivering to our area, presumably because we live quite a long way from the store. We switched to Asda home delivery but we now feel guilty that we’re taking a slot from a vulnerable household. From next week my wife has volunteered to go to the shop to queue outside and then get allowed in on a one in, one out basis. Because some items are limited, I’ve started buying beer and wine in bulk online. We’re really lucky that so far, we’re still being paid. We’re not spending money on childcare or petrol and I’m not spending much money other than online deliveries of alcohol and clothing! We also have a garden and a balcony and lots of lovely walks on our doorstep. It has been sunny, I’ve been getting more sleep, I’ve spent loads of quality time with the kids, I’ve read about 4 books already. I’m actually enjoying it. Obviously, that could change if the virus touches our family directly or we lose our jobs but for now there are a lot of silver linings. Our thoughts inevitably turn to our parents regularly. My Mum lives in France and has been living under their strict lockdown, she can’t leave the house without a piece of paper confirming who she is and where she is going. My Dad and Step Mother are old enough to be vulnerable, as are my in-laws. So, even though we don’t fear for our immediate family we would be extremely worried if any of our parents became ill. Four weeks in and I still don’t directly know of anyone with the virus. The news is full of death but I look out of our window, or go for a walk in the sunshine and all I see are people walking, jogging or cycling. It feels like a national holiday! I’ve discovered new walks in the area. My wife has started jogging and I’ve been doing Yoga in the living room! My youngest daughter seems delighted that we’re all home together every day. My oldest daughter is in Year 1 at Primary School. She claims not to miss school but I think she misses the structure. It’s quite hard for me and my wife to work from home and entertain the kids, let alone home school them. Technology has been embraced as a means of communicating with each other. Probably excessively so with work. On one day at the beginning of lockdown I was contacted in 8 different ways – email, phone, WhatsApp, Skype instant message, OneNote, Teams, Zoom and Yammer (internal social media). It was ridiculous. But that has since calmed down a bit. Initially I think that everyone was just communicating for the sake of proving that they were ‘working’. We now have a daily Microsoft Teams meeting at 10:30 and another at 3:30. In this way my team have more face to face contact than we used to. Technology is also being used socially, to remain connected with friends and family. I have a Friday lunchtime pint Zoom meeting with some work colleagues. And today, our family was one of four families who connected on Skype for an hour for a chocolate themed quiz, which involved the kids racing to bring various items to the camera. Social media has been full of memes etc about self-isolating. This was a funny novelty at first but my phone started to struggle under the sheer weight of lengthy crap. So I’m having to do a lot of deleting. I chatted with a neighbour who is a fireman yesterday (maintaining the correct physical distance!). He said that the Fire & Rescue Service is quieter and that there were some other noticeable changes. He said that in his dealings with the public he felt that people were more aggressive. He also said that there had been an increased in rubbish fires – where people were burning household and garden waste. He also said that he’d heard that A&E departments were really quiet. This seems to be partly due to a lack of sporting injuries and drink fuelled fighting but also because people are avoiding hospitals. The danger of this could be that people could be self-diagnosing or diagnosing dependents incorrectly when they really should be visiting hospital. Working from home has been fairly painless so far. My employer only expects best efforts rather than 35 hours a week of productive activity. Most days contact with others such as meetings don’t start until about 9:30 and the day winds down at about 4pm. And between 12 and 2 everything goes quiet while people have lunch. It makes you wonder how we all fill 9-5 in the office. I’m working from a desk in our spare room. I have a work mobile phone, a work iPad and my own laptop, which I can use to log into work systems. Although there has been signs of community spirit, there’s also been some signs of division and unrest. In my area there has largely been a positive community response. The weekly applause for the NHS sees most people clapping on their balconies every Thursday at 8pm. People are using the community Facebook page to offer to do shopping for anyone who is self-isolating. Households with children are drawing rainbows and displaying them in their windows. But there are also people who are judging the behaviours of others and taking to Facebook to berate people for allegedly not staying at home or supposedly having friends over for barbeques. So, in some ways we’re seeing the rifts of Brexit healed in the face of a common enemy but some people can’t help but behave like a twat, regardless of the circumstances. It’s worth pointing out that I keep missing the NHS applause because it clashes with the kids’ bedtimes. I’m not disappointed in that to be honest. I find the whole thing a bit cringey. A friend of mine put it nicely – ‘I’m very grateful to all who work in the NHS etc but why do I need to show it by banging a saucepan?’ 6 June 2020. We’re not banging saucepans anymore. Lockdown is being eased which, not surprisingly, is being linked to an increase in cases here in the South West. Images of packed beaches are hard to come to terms with while we still have a killer virus on the loose. Government guidance has become more and more opaque, leading to people making up their own rules. We’ve seen a documentary about hospitals dealing with Covid 19 patients and it’s really harrowing viewing. My 6-year-old daughter went back to school on 2nd June. I feel fairly comfortable about it as there’s only about eight kids in the class and the school are well organised with distancing measures and hand washing etc. My wife is a Primary School teacher so she’s back at work too. I’m still working from home. My employer isn’t planning a return to the office yet, thankfully. Some of my colleagues are missing the human interaction of being at work but most people seem to be working at home quite happily. I still don’t know anyone who has died from the virus. But I’m much less relaxed about catching it, now that I’ve seen what it can do. There’s an interesting theory that worriers are coping better with lockdown. The idea is that people who suffer from anxiety are hard wired to take this situation in their stride! Which is fortunate for me! On the flip side of that I am aware of some people who have been hit hard mentally by this virus. People who live on their own are an obvious concern as their human interaction has been stripped right back. I’ve been trying to support local businesses by getting beer delivered from local breweries. 23 August 2020 (Now incorporating the Summer Directive 2020) When I think about time, the main change for me is getting more sleep. I haven’t set an alarm for months. The upside of this is more sleep, which is a huge plus. I’m still spending more time with my children than I used to. The downside is that I’m not walking to work. I’m sleeping more but probably becoming more slothful. I’ve tried to counteract this by doing yoga in the sitting room from my old Yogalates DVD. I’m having to force myself to get out and go for a walk. I tend to wake up, log on for work, watch TV with lunch, then when I’ve finished work its dinnertime, then kids’ baths and stories before bed. Then more TV with the wife and a bad habit of eating snacks before sleep – which means my weight is fluctuating massively. There will be more structure to my day when my children go back to school and I will be dropping my daughter off at school – which, at least, makes for guaranteed exercise and fresh air every day. I’m drinking more alcohol. Because I’m not going to the pub or the supermarket, I’m getting wine and beer delivered in bulk, which is quite fun and exciting but clearly not a positive lifestyle choice. I don’t drink from Monday to Thursday but that means that from Friday to Sunday I’m irritable and tired and depressed! I try to fast at least twice a week – but my version of fasting is probably another man’s feasting. I know a couple of people who have lost loads of weight over the last few months by taking on new exercise regimes. I quite ashamed of my lazy, slothful approach to life. I’m in front of my screen more as my work time is at home and is solitary. I’m not getting the natural breaks from my screen. Meetings are on screen; everything is on screen. This is definitely a downside. My interaction with friends is largely on social media channels like Messenger and WhatsApp, with colleagues it’s on Microsoft Teams and social media channels like WhatsApp. With family I will FaceTime or speak on the phone. I’ve also had phone calls with good friends in Australia. With a global pandemic we’re all experiencing the same thing. I’m not looking forward to going back to an office routine – so much of that way of life seems like a waste of time and effort. Why trudge 4 miles to an office everyday when I can carry out the same tasks from home? But that routine did bring me more exercise, fresh air and social interaction. We were due to go to France for my Mum’s 70th birthday but that didn’t happen. We’ve rearranged for October but whether this actually happens or not depends on quarantine advice. We did go to some holiday accommodation near Plymouth instead, which meant that we went to see my Dad and had a day on the beach. If I could do lockdown again, I’d use it to lose weight and walk more. We like being at home together but we end up having too much screen time and too much food."

My emotions have been mixed, optimistic, anxious, lonely, worried and claustrophobic. The Government My thoughts on the political decisions that have been made are as follows: 1. Wrong to allow travel in and out of the country. 2. PPE absolutely disgraceful. 3. NHS started with one hand tied behind their backs. 40.000 vacancies at the start of the virus not filled. Nine years of Tory cuts! 4. Testing of key workers non existent. 5. Too few testing stations, so NHS staff having worked a twelve hour shift in extreme circumstances expected to travel long distances. In some cases after queueing for two hours being told the vaccines had run out. I have no idea just what steps the government will take in the coming weeks. I think their plan will change many times because they have not thought things through. Having just watched their broadcast [10th May] I don't think they have thought any of the steps through thoroughly. Stay Safe has gone to Stay Alert. I think THEY should have been so much more alert right from the beginning when Italy and Spain were experiencing this virus, and learned from their mistakes, what worked, what didn’t. News I tend to watch all the news channels, but my favourite is Channel 4 news. I read the Daily Mirror but it is mainly Radio 4 that I like to listen too especially the 5pm broadcasts from Downing Street, or as one famous presenter and journalist said the Alice in Wonderland time! My thoughts on these broadcasts are: 1. Do they really thing the country believe them. 2. At times they look like frightened rabbits caught in the headlights. 3. Health Minister, dire 4.PM even direr 5. When asked a question they don’t like they are like sulky teenagers. 6. Again when asked a question they don’t want to answer they waffle to avoid answering. 7. Praising the NHS when they have spent the last nine years starving them of cash and organising privatisation through the back door. Work and home life As both my husband and I are both retired we have not been working. However I do do a voluntary job which I have not been able to do, I miss this work very much especially the social contact. I am struggling with not being able to go and about and having some time to myself. I am in desperate need of solitude! Usually both my husband and I do many things separately, hobbies etc. This has not been possible, I think we both miss time apart, I know I do! I have kept busy and planned my days. A spring clean and declutter which I actually enjoyed because I didn’t have to rush. The garden shed was also included! Working in the garden. Finally the attic. so all this has kept me occupied. Also reading writing and researching. Technology I have not learnt anything new regarding technology. Yes I know I’m lazy but I just feel I know what my family and friends all look like so I don’t need to Face-time them. I have rung and texted people and kept in touch with the people I love. I have used the internet a lot to research etc. Shopping and food. When people were stockpiling toilet rolls I just thought it was ridiculous, however not long after I walked into a Coop supermarket and there was no bread, milk, tinned goods, meat, cleaning products, soap, and toilet rolls. That was scary, I realised people were panicking and that was serious. When supermarkets were saying, “just buy what you would normally and there will be enough” people ignored that. With hindsight rationing should have been put in place much sooner because obviously people were panicking/being greedy /selfish etc. I usually have my shopping delivered and had placed an order as usual right at the very beginning but only half was delivered. As I am able to shop, from then on I have queued once a week for food . Thankfully I have managed to get what I need not necessarily what I want, so for that I’m grateful. I have to eat gluten free for medical reasons and have been unable to get gluten free flour anywhere but as I say I am grateful for what I can get and all the people working to supply food. My cooking habits have stayed the same but we have been eating far to much chocolate, cake and biscuits! Now my flour has run out [that’s no bad thing] we have decided to eat healthily from today as the scales have told us to do so!! Entertainment and Leisure I started by walking half hour each day, but after a few weeks I was bored by walking around nearby streets. As I have lived in my house for forty seven years all the houses and gardens are familiar to me. At first it was lovely seeing all the spring flowers and trees coming into blossom. However now I am desperate to walk in my local nature reserve and an RHS garden not far from where I live, and especially to see the bluebells. Both quite rightly have been closed. No new hobbies or new skills learnt I’m afraid and no DIY needed doing. I have been re reading books written by Nella Last who wrote for MO from 1939 to 1966. I have had these books for many years and regularly go back to them. The first one Nella’s War I bought back in the eighties but every time I read them they teach me something new. I also have books by Simon Garfield who has written collections of war time diaries from MO, so I have plenty of reading material thank goodness! Radio 4 I love, that alone is worth the licence fee. It has the ability to make me laugh, to make me cry, to entertain me, to inform me, to make me see things in a different way, to educate me. Long may that continue. TV, again does all the above. There are the very best of programs and the very worst of programs but we all have choices to watch what interests us. I especially enjoyed all the VE day programs, the old film footage of VE Day and the interviews of that generation. I find it all so moving. It annoys me that we are comparing those times to now. Whose house has been bombed? Do we have ration books? Are we waiting day after day for letters from loved ones in the services abroad? So let’s stop doing that. Personal hygiene I’m still showering daily and doing all the things I would normally do, however I am in desperate need of a haircut! I would love to have a massage, facial, manicure and pedicure. The massage I have once a month and do miss that, the rest I have very occasionally. Sleep I normally go to bed around 10.30 and go to sleep virtually straight away, this has not changed. However I would normally wake up between 6.00 to 7.00 and this has changed, I am waking up later some mornings and wondering if this is because people aren’t going to work so no cars are being moved, it’s so much quieter. I very rarely dream or if i do I never remember them on waking. The End Can I just say how much I appreciate all the people who are working though this. The NHS, the food chain, the carers, refuse collectors, bus and train staff, and so very many more. If as a society we do not recognise all these key workers who are low paid workers and do them justice, i.e. pay and working conditions we as a society will have no integrity."

Most people I know are incredibly angry with the Government and its handling of everything. One disaster after another. It started with rumours of them going for herd immunity at the beginning of the year, when the first cases happened in the UK. The risks were minimised. We were told it was a mild illness. Johnson joking he would not stop shaking hands. Then he got it. In fairness, that was when they had started to tell people that it was more serious, but mass gatherings weren’t banned, sports were still being played. Their fear, of course, was that the NHS would be overwhelmed, as they were in Italy. Doctors there having to choose who got the chance to live, by putting them in intensive care. I don’t think it ever came to that here, or not so we have been told. The lack of personal protective clothing (PPE) for the doctors and front line staff. I accept that is probably due to successive governments not prioritising stores, but then we are told this Government are sourcing them and all front line staff will have them and special flights are bringing them in. The NHS staff saying it is just not the case and they are having to re-use equipment. The lies over the number of deaths. Only telling us the number of deaths in hospital, not at home or in care homes. Do those people not count? The office for national statistics says the deaths for this time of year are up on last year by 50,000+, yet we are told that around 37,000 have died. Then this latest scandal, with Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, driving up to his parents in Durham and lying on his twitter page, that he was self isolating at home. Spotted going for walks at Barnard Castle over Easter. He did a press conference yesterday and answered questions from some reporters, but would not express regret or apologise. Still firmly believed he was in the right and later Johnson said Cummings had behaved with integrity throughout!!!! Actually, that sums it up. Tory integrity is to break the rules, lie and think you are above everyone else. How can you tell when the Tory party are lying? When one of them speak. I started off as Conservative, but recently – and also because I dislike our tory MP, I have voted SDP. I am so glad I didn’t vote this lot in at the last election. There doesn’t seem to be any sort of a coherent plan. I think they just make it up as they go along. At the weekend announcing that the extremely vulnerables (and that includes me) are “allowed” out for an hour and to meet a person who is not a member of their household. This was announced without any consultation with any medical teams, doctors, GPs etc most of whom are furious and have taken to tweeter to vent their anger. I am not doing anything differently. I do not trust this Government and their “science”. In truth, because the village where we live has around 450 inhabitants and a lot of those are on far flung farms, I have been walking the dogs each day and avoiding anyone I happen to see. H only goes to the village shop for his Sunday paper and to the outside market once a week for fruit and veg and some fish. We’ll just continue. S, back at his flat in Brighton, is proposing to go out less. Brighton has been hit by waves of tourists this last weekend. The weather was so hot and the beaches were rammed. People were not social distancing. Here in Sawley and in other parts of the Ribble Valley, there were lots of strangers, walking dogs and children, consulting maps and going into the village shop. Hoards of cyclists and motor cyclists on the roads. H saw this when he walked the dogs and went to the village shop for his paper. He didn’t go out again and nor did I. The news at lunchtime says the Government is in negotiations with the aviation industry so that people can go on holiday and not have to self isolate for two weeks when they come back. Otherwise the travel companies will being going bankrupt. Well, they will anyway if people are dying or too scared to fly. Profit before lives. In any case, my guess is lots of countries will refuse us access, given that our death rate is the worst in Europe. Then the announcement that non-vital shops are to be allowed to open from 15 June, when 200 – 300 people a day are still dying. It seems that the Government are just trying to make it seem that everything is OK and getting back to normal. It isn’; they just have more capacity in ICU to take very ill people. One does wonder if one has had the virus in a mild form though. I had a mild sore throat and temperature for a day or so the week before lockdown and a cough that lasted three weeks. As my immune system is compromised from the chemo I had during 2018, I don’t think it could have been covid 19. I am sure I would have been a lot worse, but who knows? I am struggling more from the after effects of the car accident in February of this year and cannot get any physio or help, due to having to shield. I am also having counselling for PTSD and although we haven’t specifically talked about the current crisis, we have talked about my anxiety and how to deal with it and it has helped. I watch the news on TV and quite often the covid updates each afternoon. H, surprisingly, often can’t watch the news, he finds it too depressing. I also look at news online and some of the tweets on twitter. I worry that the covid updates each day are a lot of whitewash. I didn’t think that to begin with, but I do now, given the lies we have been fed. Homelife for H and I has not altered much, due to the fact I was already not working, because of the car accident. It has been a joy to be in the garden in this lovely weather and I am refusing to allow myself to worry about how we will cope if this goes on much longer. I mean financially. Having said that, after I hurt my back carrying in the shopping delivery last week, I have been a lot more depressed. I have aggravated the back injury from the car accident and have struggled to sleep or move easily. This has caused the PTSD to rear its ugly head again and all my fears about not being able to work have rushed at me and dragged me into the black slimy hole of despair. I try not to watch the news too much now. I check up on tweets and of course facebook to stay connected with some friends. Watching the news, I despair of the world. A black man was killed by a white policeman a week ago. The policeman knelt on his neck for 20 mins and asphyxiated him, while “restraining” him. There have been riots in lots of American cities and protests around the world, entitled Black Lives Matter. That idiot Trump is spouting off, even though the protestors were in front of the White House. He is calling the governors around America “jerks” and saying he will send the army in to clear up the protestors if they aren’t stricter with them. Meanwhile in New York, the bodies from the virus are being put into mass graves and held in refrigerated trucks, as the morgues are full. I wonder if someone will get so angry with him that there is an assassination attempt made. I can’t help but think it would be a good thing. Here, there are photos of Blackpool beach awash with litter after people were there in their hundreds yesterday. Shocking that people have learned nothing during this lockdown of how to behave and care for nature. That was the message that we hoped would follow, after seeing news footage of how the pollutions levels are down, wild life are coming into towns and the seas and beaches were clean. One weekend and it has all gone to put. I despair, I really do. I can’t help but think that God is sending us a message. We had floods over winter, now lovely weather but droughts, bush fires in Australia, rioting and unrest in America and this terrible virus over all the world. The lockdown has shown how the earth can heal and I think that is what we are being shown – stop your selfishness and destruction, have compassion and take care of the world. The first weekend out and it is back to selfish, destructive behaviour. God must be in despair and the second wave of the virus will come. Maybe even stronger than the first. If I was God, I’d make it stronger, though try to be discriminating about who it kills – the greedy, cruel and horrible people. If only. I do think a second wave will hit within two to four weeks of this slackening of lockdown. I fear that what we have experienced in the last ten weeks is the tip of the iceberg. I sit here in my kitchen typing. The French windows on the balcony are open and I watch the goldfinches on the feeders eating niger seeds, sparrows and robins pecking at fat balls and a blackbird taking a drink from the bowl I have put out. The garden is very green, despite the drought. The air is full of bird song, but the horrors of world situation are not far away from our little sanctuary. Lots of people have started to use zoom etc to keep in touch with friends and have virtual meet ups or indeed meetings for work on line. It doesn’t really appeal to me. I have talked to family and friends on the phone and exchanged emails and that has been fine. Staring at someone or several people on a screen in an attempt at socialising just doesn’t appeal. Our Sainsbury delivery arrived today. I alternate between Sainsburys and Tesco, that way I can get two deliveries a week in. One friend of mine goes to Tesco once every two weeks! She must be incredibly organised. I find it hard to work out the menu for a week and usually forget something. At first it felt like Christmas when the delivery arrived, now it is a pain. It all as to be disinfected outside before it can be put away and sometimes they have made substitutions that I really don’t want. We were told that outdoor markets can re-open now, which came as a surprise, as Clitheroe has never closed. Not that I have been, but H goes of course and we want to try to support local business as much as we can. Our eating habits haven’t changed. I have always cooked pretty much from scratch. Lunch is homemade soup in winter and salads in summer. The salads have a mix of leaves, plus grated carrots, nuts, seeds, beetroot, chive flowers, herbs and usually an egg from one of our hens. In the evening, as we are pretty much vegan, lots of vegetables in various dishes. H gets his fish dish once a week at the weekend, with a nice sauce. People talking about having so much more time and learning new skills or hobbies make me feel inadequate. Or cross. They must live in bloody little flats or houses. I still don’t have enough time to do what I need to, but there again, being injured again and unable to do much with this bad back, makes things difficult. Having said that, the garden is the best it has been for a long time. I have, for the first time, had enough time to prick out seedlings, grow things on properly and harden them off, before planting out. We are hoping for great things in a little while, when everything starts to bloom. Plus, we are pretty much on top of the weeding! Our plot (including the house) is four-fifths of an acre, so it is quite large for the two of us to manage, especially as H is waiting for a new knee and struggles and I have this terrible back now. There doesn’t seem to be much on TV. They have put some more films on and lots of repeats, but often I can’t be bothered with them. I watch Bargain Hunt every lunchtime while I make our salads. There is going to be a dearth when the social distancing ends, as no new programmes or films are being made. Yesterday was my birthday and I did feel upset at my inability to go out. Prior to the lockdown, wehad planned on meeting S in London, having a nice lunch and going to the National Portrait Gallery. Last year, when I was 60, we met S in London and had lunch at Fortnum & Mason, which is my favourite shop in the world. Then we went for cocktails at The Savoy. A few days later, H took me to Le Manoir Aux Quatre Saisons near Oxford. He had even booked a four poster suite. It was wonderful. We stayed in Lincoln on the way back and that was lovely too. Then a few days after that, a friend had booked a surprise birthday party at the Waggon and Horses in Bolton-by-Bowland. After all that, anything else was going to be a bit quiet, but I never thought it would involve being in our house and garden all day. It would have been lovely to take the dogs with us up to the Lakes for a day and have a pub lunch at the Drunken Duck and a walk around Tarn Howes. It was not to be. Instead H had made a lot of effort and bought me some lovely presents and a fabulous card. It was actually a Christmas card he had spare! He couldn’t find a decent birthday card, as those shops are shut, so he amended the rather beautiful “Happy Christmas to my lovely wife” card, by putting a label over Christmas and writing Birthday. He then made up a touching poem and stuck it over the Christmas wording inside. What a darling he is. We facetimed S. I had made myself a birthday cake and sent S a third of it last week, so we could eat birthday cake and drink tea together. It is always a joy to see him and talk to him, but not as good as him being here, of course. H had also ordered afternoon tea from a local bakery, which arrived beautifully packaged. He knows it is one of my favourite things! That fed us all day and we had some champagne at night, but by bedtime I felt a bit hollow and sad. We are still in separate bedrooms and bathrooms, as per the instructions for extremely vulnerable people. I have been sleeping a bit better recently. I went through a terrible time of not sleeping and lots of anxiety and nightmares. I think the counselling I am still having by phone has helped me deal with anxiety and so sleep better. Sometimes I don’t mind sleeping alone, as our sleeping patters are different. H sometimes want to go to bed later than me and he always gets up later than me. I prefer separate bathrooms. H isn’t showering as much as I do and sometimes he doesn’t shave for a few days. I am strict with myself and shower/hairwash every other day. On the days I don’t shower, I have a good wash. To be honest, I don’t feel like it and it is a surprising effort to do it! It would be easy to just not bother. I am strict with my facial care too, toning after cleansing and putting on serum and moisturiser, as well as special eye moisturiser which I pat round in the morning to drain the lumphatic system around the eyes. I don’t look that great, but I’m sure I’d look a lot worse without it. A few days ago I had a try at touching up my roots. I am still blonde (ish) at the front, but the chemo has made my hair darker at the back! I had sent off for some organic hair colour, which was bleach free. It took me ages to do, as I was trying to do just sections as the hairdresser does. It really made my arms ache and I got fed up with it in the end. When I washed it out afterwards, it looked darker than when I had started! Walking the dogs down the road, there were a few motorbikers siting on the tables by the river. One said something to the others and they all turned round to look. Well, I thought, he’s either said what has that woman done to her hair, or he’s said “have you seen the size of that German Shepherd? What a beautiful dog” In hindsight the latter, as our W gets lots of admiring comments on his looks. He is a golden sable German Shepherd and I have yet to see another dog as big as he is. He is 29 inches to his shoulder and those shoulders are huge and powerful from all the swimming he likes to do. One of our neighbours always says the dog looks like an extra from Game of Thrones. He is also the gentlest and sweetest dog I have ever owned."

Everything is so raw, 35.000 people dead. Imagine! And that is just here , worldwide is a staggering total. I have been watching the WHO Assembly.I think they are great and its a brilliant organisation. My health A short while ago, it is now May 20th and the date I refer to is April 8th, I had a strange neurological occurrence when I suddenly couldn’t remember my daughter’s name and then when I did find it on my phone .It was not Covid related but I needed help. Actually I wrote something about it that I will copy and paste in here now. And also I think my balance is awry, Freedom shouts loud daily and I always hear it. A week ago I had a brain event -an occurrence whilst doing 3 things semi simultaneously, activities, the worst of which was listening to the (f.w). government doing their important missive stuff even with the PM having had his own Covid visitation. I was booking and paying for a webinar, and looking at a text asking after my daughter was so I thought I’d better phone her. But I couldn’t quite remember her name. Her first name came but together with her surname it didn’t seem quite right but I phoned her and the words I needed were’t quite there.I had a headache by this time and she sensible woman that she is took me through the stroke set up which I remembered I knew then sent her partner round with asprin since she deduced it was not a stroke but a TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) We talked from a distance, he sitting on my front wall and me from the window and I regained my right word speech though his description of our initial communication belies the writing. My daughter and he swapped, he went to look after my grand daughter. The paramedics came and my speech with effort was precise, just to prove the point. They took my very high blood pressure several times and were very nice to me, talking in their ambulance and I remembering the last time I’d been in one with my friend P onn his final journey to the Whittington. She came from Australia the lady and told me how she and a friend from the same town ran into two others from there in some far flung place. They had wanted to take me to UCH or the Neurology hospital but couldn’t for some reason. This was the farthest I’d travelled in three weeks having started shut down on Tuesday March 17th. Not locked down though, still free but under daughter’s orders to be safe. My last weekend an art class, a jazz concert and Kew gardens, full to overflowing with communication. The paramedics dropped me in the Green Assessment assessment area (which I newly discovered is the Non Covid hospital coding) to be cared for by B and L then the marvellous Ambulatory Care where I was tended splendidly by Nurse S, named M at birth then renamed by a sister who couldn’t say her name.Tea on request, biscuits on request. But still high blood pressure and a CT scan which showed possible damage because of the blood pressure.I still had a headache until a couple of doses of paracetamol and a long read of Ferdinand Pessoa’s book of Disquiet which I picked up deliberately before leaving the house. I came home in a cab, looking at Archway as if out of prison bars. Archway resisted for so many years, only just, but not this night in walking distance, quiet streets. The doctor was lovely too. At home I sat in darkness for 10 minutes before going to bed and a deep sleep. Two journeys, but being in the hospital too was freedom since social distancing was at an end with treatment and communication at less than 2 metres. This was unlocking the cage and as close to the normality of no distancing I’d had in quite a while. Even seeing people I knew well in the park was better outside than in but many arms lengths away. Next day a long chat with a neurologist who said someone would phone with an appointment for scans. He thought it may have been a form of migraine I hadn’t experienced before rather than a TIA. His secretary would phone with an appointment to come in for scans. It may be a problem in my neck. I’m still waiting. I’m still waiting, not without proactive chasing though at daughters insistence.Chasing my tail in circles. They, I think it was they sent a survey the day after the phone chat with the head honcho of the stroke department. I wasn’t sure it was from them and was in such a bad mood, so irritated with everyone and everything that I put the phone down. I’ve left messages galore, galore, a lovely word. I’m glad I have. I’m rather tired. But here I am in the garden. Writing this, free in a way. Locked in in another sense would have been terrible. I’m not wanting scans in Queens Square but they are probably needed and several days later than anticipated. I look forward to getting out of the hospital where I won’t have to see anyone and walking home through a central London I can only imagine, I, lover of London Christmases, empty streets too often crowded and noisy. Another potential taste of Freedom. I should be thinking i’m lucky. and now i think of it i AM. YES, I AM, Here, still here, in my garden writing this to O and able to say and think, I Am I sent a card to thank them at my local hospital, they were very good to me. London Christmases, empty streets too often crowded and noisy. Another potential taste of Freedom. I should be thinking i’m lucky. and now i think of it i AM. YES, I AM, Here, still here, in my garden writing this to O and able to say and think, I Am April 16th 2020 Phase 2 Much anxiety about all this although as an undercurrent, more aware of headache snd posture and tiredness and the going from one to ten with no space in between, in getting irritated, afraid, het up, tense, stressed. The phone calls I made elicited nothing. I email the address attached to the phone number I’m given by the hospitals appointments line. To no avail and yet the doctor who rang me said I’d receive an appointment in a few days. Round and round and then falling to stillness until my daughter picks up the lifeless stick, gives me a different email and I retry the email address with a letter’s difference and different phone numbers and I run another circular path. She got fed up and wrote to them using her college address and title of Dr. There came a response in less than an hour. The power of hierarchy! She may say the power of clarity, thinking I always say more than I need to and could be clearer. The differences in personality, different characters , abilities, deficits , this all comes out in the writing and doesn’t make us who we are but shows us something about ourselves and others. The doctor rang and talked and questioned me and said his secretary would phone me with an appointment the next day which she did. My sister listed all the things not to forget and suggested I use a dictaphone, my phone much clearer than any I’ve ever used I discovered and he was very acquiescent to the idea in the situation. I resented the suggestion though when she made it but I was very grateful in the end. I It felt like an extra thing and our prior conversations had led me to think he may baulk at the idea so I would need courage I didn’t have. My sister is so organised and had years of this kind of situation with my parents so knew what she was talking about, a third ear for invalids and the aged. Look at that word that was in our vocabulary for so long invalid, invalid, not valid, a person becomes ill or damaged or disabled and they are invalid. Yes it's still current, still there in the dictionary. I listened back today to the recording and it could neither have been clearer or less indicative of the emotive conflict I sensed but perhaps was all in me or between us but in an understated way. I recall my emotions I don't really know his only their expression as interpreted by me. I had ordered a cab and before I left I was filled with fear although apart from not finding things I was looking for I didn’t know why. The MRI didn't thrill me certainly or talking to a hospital consultant that hadn't followed through on what he'd said previously and he seemed in an irritated hurry from the sound of his voice. The cab came and M drove,£18 for the trip, I hadn't met him but he was friendly, chatty and kind. The Hospital was disorganised, intermittently. I followed instructions, was shown the MRI room, the flowers on the sanitiser bottle in the loo making an impression at each loo stop I made. The was her name, older, kind, welcoming, her name she told me on hearing mine was A , shortened to its present form. The MRI was excruciating though she said it was a very fast machine, the sounds loud but interestingly repetitive, when the technician asked why I liked it, it was easy to compare with minimalist genres I love and he understood. As I left I said there is another scan due but she said it hadn’t been ordered so the doctor would look at this first. Captive memories form, are those where a stranger has made a positive impression as she did. had told me to go to. Why shorten a beautiful name like that to one the host nation can handle? As I walked down I saw a man on the phone outside the centre who I thought correctly was the consultant. Looking back I think he reminded me of Dom Joly. I went in, had blood pressure taken and temperature, by a young man who gave me a mask and apron. The whole corridor was filled with Chinese students, laughing and being hospital close which as I’d already discovered at the Whittington is as it used to be , no 2 metre spacing here. I waited, and waited and then was told I would have to have the other scan, as I’d been informed the previous day. I went back and met with A who started to walk me to another bit of the building whilst we chatted. The assistant from before told us someone else was to do the scan, she said goodbye and I waited. The new technician said hello and asked me to wait again which I did, someone else asked for my hospital number which I didn’t have, I called my daughter although he said he’s find it soon then everything was fine and the technician invited me in. It was an interesting scan all around my neck with cold gel and then interesting conversation about how B became attracted to this work. He wanted to do something in the medical field looking radiography he came across the sonar aspects which really attracted him and the proper name of which I now cannot recall. Then I went to see the doctor. It was called a Carotid Doppler. I have been trying to remember the name for this so that aspect and of course it's ultrasound. As I was writing it made me very anxious that I couldn't remember it as this was a facet of the event on April 8 but it's also a facet of the ageing memory and anxiety seems to be operating differently in me now than I have known it previously, seems important to note this, it seems important that I am kind to myself and give myself time. I am 68. I live in the world. I am taking my own blood pressure for the first time in my life and that is provoking anxiety in itself and I can perhaps work with this, learn how to manage it, but isn't the feeling of anxiety which is worst is that something is terribly terribly wrong. And knowing the difference as perhaps a matter of insight and understanding and isn't kindness and important part of this? I asked could I record the conversation he was very happy to do that and when I tested it later in the day I realised I had a very good record although I was too squeamish at hearing the sound of my own voice and recalling some of the emotions to actually play it until the next day when I listened in the sun in my garden and was very pleased indeed that I had it. Emotions really was that there was a conflict between us and me wanting to make very accurate the story and him wanting to get it done. I could feel a kind of tension but then when I played it back it all sounded very reasonable indeed, if I say now that he had his elbows on the table with his hair flopping over his hands making the idea that my friend was too long rather insignificant although I cannot wait for M to start up again to get mine cut. Conversation started with him recalling our conversations prior and in retrospect he was very skilled at making the conversation both meaningful in the recording in all senses for me and for him. He couldn't say for sure if I had had a TIA, he couldn’t say and the other possibility was that I had experienced a rare migraine another possibility, he checked my eyes and my ears even finding wax but no other problem and at the end asked I has assistant which was on a kind of iPad and then I went to have blood taken by a very skilled person I asked was he a haematologist and now he was a phlebotomist whom I interpreted as a lobotomist which I later thought was very funny. The doctor did say there was a widening in the artery in my neck and they would have to keep an eye on that, some months down the line. Then I went to see someone to do a heart trace who I asked could it measure anxiety and he replied yes and when is it was finished nothing major that would be interpreted by the consultant who had also told me that when it was possible I would have one of those three day heart measurement things. The conversation the two of us had was really pleasant. We talked about where we live what we each know if those areas how are you got to work which is funnier than what I'm writing, involving how NHS staff are being treated well at the moment and have the gates at Vauxhall are easy to pass through. His name is K. Is because he is still there so the experience has gone. One of the things that was important about the conversation I first had with Dr S was that he was speaking in the present continuous and I had to ask him you're talking about the event about what happened and he said yes I was like I was being pedantic, I don't think it helped our communication. I left after that, talk to E on the phone and walk to Brunswick Square where some of the shops and all of the restaurants were shut. Waitrose didn't have what I specifically wanted so I bought loads of yoghurt for E, M and me. I walked through Brunswick Square Park, so flowers I no longer recall and the sunshine was marvellous. I walked on right down to near King's Cross remembering when M and I walked along there in the very noisy very dirty early afternoon when she was in the buggy and I was trying to get her to sleep. I called the cab firm I use, it seems sweet to me that my details come up when I phone as if they know me just from these hospital visits.I said I'd meet the driver at Caledonian Road pool giving me enough time to walk some more which I did happily although he was a bit impatient when he got there before me. The cab cost £12 and the drivers name was A and I was very happy to go to sit on my balcony in the sunshine. Of the million things that I have forgotten what is important now is that life is up-and-down, things come and go we don't know when something is over we don't know when something is terribly wrong or if the imagination is just having full reign upon the body but because we don't know does not mean that something is happening or not, something is always happening it seems. The high blood pressure that appears to be happening now I would rather were not happening and hyper vigilance is at once a small price to pay for looking after oneself and something of a thorn, a weapon, something not understood. I wrote this, phase 2, from April 23rd on April 23, but I don't think it's over yet, there seems further to go, I'll take 75 mgs, or a junior aspirin a day. In the words of the doctor, a phrase from my past, a junior aspirin which I can see in my memory in a box with lots of colourful children on the front, stick kids in pink and blue, turquoise, something I'll see in a Pharmacy at some point. This morning I've suffered from anxiety again and it's passing, has passed. Is it a byproduct of what's going on? I don't know but perhaps it's the end of phase 2. Phase 3 I’m still waiting for that letter, the appointment was nearly a month ago.The doctor said take my blood pressure a couple of times a week as it seems to be ok so that’s what I’m doing although I get anxious just thinking about it. Today it’s 130 over 80 first call. Second call its 117 over 72. So that’s ok although I DO WONDER ABOUT THE MACHINE AND I CO-ORDINATING WELL or is that me co-ordinating badly. I don’t know actually, certainly nervousness affects me. May ?? So that was the event as it occurred to now. I’m feeling much better. My daughter emailed for the results of the tests that I had on the day at the hospital as its a month since I had the whatever it was. May 20th 2020 On May 29th it still hasn’t arrived. June 12th 2020 It came sometime in June so far. My doctor changed the aspirin I take for another drug.I have to take my blood pressure couple of times a week. For the moment this is how it continues. The Neurological hospital is supposed to have me back in for a three day heart trace but I imagine we’ll have to get back in touch with them once again once the horrors of Covid are abating. Abating because I listened to the WHO’s media briefing. 41, 279 is the figure of deaths in this country. That’s a horrific figure. Perhaps I will join this number, perhaps you will. I hope not. Today (July 4th) It’s almost 45,000, the death rate. If anything is taken from my directive return it is this consciousness of this it should be that. This is the health issue of now. The death caused by the pandemic. Our Government Our government is SHIT, yes SHIT. They are arrogant to have acted they way they have, they have blood on their hands from the sheer incompetency of the lack of action. I deplore the prime minister, the secretary of state and the health minister who I would rename ………………………. The steps they should HAVE taken are to have been testing and contact tracing since the very beginning and locked down earlier. Shut down the airports earlier and allowed no-one into the country who wasn’t returning for lockdown and then tested them at the airports. Likewise anyone leaving for the sake of other nations and tracked and traced their contacts. Willfully ignorant is my austere judgement of them. I’ve had arguments with others that say they have done their best but as it has been so dishonest they ought to have joined together with other parties and worked on behalf of humanity and not their selfish selves.I’m glad they ploughed money into the furlough and peoples livelihoods but the death rate is far, far, far too high. May 29th 2020 The Dominic Cummings debacle has been going on for a week. Last night one of my neighbours had a huge party, not sure why birthday party perhaps but social distancing was nowhere in sight. Another neighbour rang to see if I knew which house it was and I didn't tell them because I didn't want them calling the police because if Dominic Cummings can break the rules then everybody can and well and though it is sad and not the right time to end social distancing, maybe it never will be, if he is not going to be thrown out of office then I certainly don't want any of my neighbours castigated in anyway. The two situations may not be comparable but Dominic Cummings makes the rules, he is the power behind the throne of the Emperor who wears no clothes. If he could drive nearly 300 miles in March to take his son to relatives there my neighbours can have a party as far as I'm concerned. June 12th Tonight I went to the shop at about 8.45 for some milk and realised I hadn’t been out in the evening for months, yes months. The security guard in Sainsbury’s asked me where I’d been and I told him I’m awake at 6.00am and usually go to bed about 10.00. I used to go out in the evening . I’ve had enough now, of the virus, of this directive.Of the government lying and being incompetent. Most people I know don’t listen to them anymore and like me get their news elsewhere. I go to the WHO, one friend reads the Guardian twice a day. Tomorrow single people can see their family again in a complicated bubble game. I went into my daughter’s flat yesterday for the first time. Her partner came here and changed a battery in a smoke alarm in my very high ceilinged hallway. I am listening to piano music. I listened to a music more at the beginning of all this. I love piano music. I’m sick of the media, I’m sick of speculation. I hope I am not sick. I meditate on zoom every day for an hour and a half with my teacher and a group. Sometimes I go to Satsang to another teacher based in another country, on Mondays I do a webinar of another non duality teacher. All this is great. I’m dying to get on a bus or a train and go to another area. Here’s another poem I wrote early on, getting very pissed off with the runners everywhere. Some of my friends agreed. In some altered fashion The world turned and many days and nights shifted round before spiralling seemed endless The world caught in a multi layered trap of its own making its victims martyred We who were we became I but not the I of United spirit the I of aloneness. In myself I grew antipathetic to my neighbours not kinder as was suggested and bothered by it This morning as I rose the birds rose with me the magnolia bloomed at its height the seeds of depression sprouted Imagine, in early spring entrapment called all our names with a blocked nose and headache I feared the worst My daughter had a new cough even before the light broke through the runners had regained the world On the phone my London friends complained of this I recalled in Finsbury Park one woman running up the hill making excruciating noises and raised her hands passing me with exclamatory groans Old people walk in the road to avoid them Serotonin highs blinding all good sense, runners not old folk My exaggeration prone to irritation fashioned itself in growing fury as I considered that even early morning now was not my own The wetlands closed soon it would be parks and anger would overspill the streets where runners would gun us down With laboured breath and focused fight we should equip them with megaphones and insist the running track be opened Where they could queue And crouch on blocks and let the aged walk in peace Or perhaps we could have the lanes marshalled like in the supermarkets super strollers out for a daily dose Beneath a pure blue sky embracing freedoms like an ability to walk and breathe without fear of being mown down. Ranting over I'll go out past noon when the workers work perchance, dog walkers midday walk on leads now their creatures and the grassland clear. Criticism of bikers left till another day, another tirade How many old folk will tally in Coronas list knocked off a pavement socially undistanced by a focused mind? April 6th 2020 It is July 1st 2020, Going back over the writing I pick out ad add in these since they are all reactions to the governments. It is July 1st and if anything I am more angry about them, sad about they deaths and dismayed at their terrible handling of the situation Reactions, responses to government edicts April 27th 2020 1.

All the care home deaths are excess deaths in the way I would term unnecessary deaths.Old people gong into hospital and being sent back to residential and care homes without having been tested. Bank and agency staff going into care homes after leaving other care homes, not having been tested themselves because there was no testing in place, there was no PPE in place. The fact has emerged that 2 years ago even with knowledge of Ebola and Sars and Mers the NHS cut back on stocks of PPE. Similarly there was an investigation into what what would happen in a pandemic and was any of the information implemented? No. Teresa May has criticised the present government Did I say I hate the government and their incompetence. Let me say it again louder, with no irony. 40,650 DEAD.. We need humility said the head of the WHO yesterday.

Yes, I am very sorry, perhaps their death was unnecessary too. Work and home life I am retired so don’t work anywhere apart from at my writing and my voluntary work is reading to someone I met and read to as a volunteer in hospice.I do this over the phone and since lockdown every day for half an hour or so or a couple of chapters.

She has had a private early scan since she has experienced miscarriages. It cost them a lot but the NHS is not doing reassurance scans. She will have to isolate again at 28 weeks. My work has often involved reading and writing and work and leisure are the same in retirement and there has been a great lessening. I read every day to a friend who was originally a patient in hospice.I think I have written this somewhere else, we are reading 2 Adventurous 4 books, reading one we read some of previously and have 1 more to go. We have read 3 famous five books prior and three Moomin stories prior over the period of lockdown.She has breathing difficulties and finds breathing hard and being read to very soothing so I phone her every day between 12 and 2. As that suits me. Technology I am so thankful I have a decent computer and a smartphone, I don’t know what I would do without them. I do lots of things on zoom but particularly meditation (think I said this before) every day with my teacher and a group from 4-5 15/20 wish except Sunday as I would have done previously at his house once a week.

But soon that faded and people treat us like shit as per usual. I don’t feel essential, I feel ‘disposable’. People treat us like trash, under pay us, overwork us. So much more. Lockdown has had me angry for working and being treated so terribly. I also hated not being able to go on walks, even if I am alone, or even to sit on the beach ALONE. So stupid. I socially distance, take it seriously but some of the rules are stupid because some people cannot understand the simplest of instructions and especially, why they are in place. I’ve felt angry at people disobeying distancing rules especially in our shop they don’t care the the Southern Cooperative does nothing to help us, we cannot stop people without masks or exemptions from entering the store, basically they want to allow people to come in without masks so they can make money from people who can’t get in anywhere else. Again, feel like dog trash throughout the whole of the pandemic. Feel isolated when not at work, can’t do my photography, missing my poetry open mics I only started going to. So much more. Not needed any professional help or other services, not that there was much, if any, access. Even nearing the end of all restrictions I still feel so little has changed for essential workers despite us propping up the country when everything stops and people shield in place. I feel angry, disappointed, sick and tired. Also had terrible experiences from large numbers of customers because I was mask-exempt and I was treated like shit. It’s funny how disability is catered for until it is convenient, then existing isn’t acceptable. The government Political decisions have been a mess, they did better than I thought as I thought the Tories would allow people to die in the streets rather than give them aid, or furlough, but then we found out Johnson did want to leave people die in the streets, it was only public backlash that forced him to offer assistance. Another example of Tories needing to be ousted, how they are scum to put it politely. Soon restrictions will be lifted, I don’t think Johnson will allow any more funds being given to anyone but his donors and rich cronies and hence restrictions will lift no matter what. Apart from masks perhaps, maybe that will continue. News I’m mainly hearing from other people, at the start of the pandemic I watched the news, but now I just live my life and hear things through work. I did watch the daily briefings but stopped unless it was a change such as relaxations of lockdown restrictions or reimposing them. BSL interpreters should have been an obvious need and I think they should have been used from the beginning Work and home life I’ve been working throughout all of the pandemic, was on furlough for November 2020 and that was it. Lockdown has impacted my health through going out on walks and taking photographs, has made me feel more isolated, but also allowed me to access more conferences due to being online and having access to more online sessions for a number of groups. G6158 Technology I’ve been using Google Meet and Zoom where I had only used Skype before, and I use video chat a lot more than I ever did, used to use Skype to talk to my dad, but I’ve used all sorts of other video conferencing tech since lockdown for a number of conferences and groups. I’ve connected to a number of other arts groups throughout lockdown. I have used social media, especially Instagram for my own art and photography and poetry and have also used it to keep up to date. Shopping and food I have used online groceries more, and spent more money at my place of work which is more expensive and hence have had less money to spend. I cooked less and ate more ready meals and meat and simple meals like rice and pork chops etc. Eaten less healthily throughout lockdown and Covid. Entertainment and leisure I’ve been doing a lot of photography on my daily walks, written a lot of poetry, attended lots of conferences online etc. I’ve learnt cyanotyping, and overall have been exercising less. Personal hygiene I have been washing my hands more and using hand sanitiser more, especially at work and when getting home. Sleep I’ve been having more nightmares relating to work, I’ve picked up more of my managers’ jobs and hence I often come into work and have to fix issues and problems from others, being one of the most senior employees here left as the managers have been on furlough. I’m not paid enough for the jobs I’m doing at a higher pay grade, felt a bit annoyed about this and overworked and more stressed."

Mass-Observer S5767 describes themself as female; age 35; married; academic researcher.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","S5767, female, 35, married, Gravesend, academic researcher Part 2: Covid19 (Update) The following should be read with the knowledge that I am a researcher in the disease area of interest. Health Health-wise, I have pretty much been fine during lockdown. I suppose it would be fair to say that my partner’s mental health condition has been mid-level triggered, partly due to the information he has been exposed to through work, disruption of routine, and third-party trauma. Emotionally speaking, I have found the process reasonable. Over the first few weeks I woke up in the middle of a panic attack about death maybe two to three times, but I would say that is the worst symptom that I have had. I am in no way worried about the consequences of getting COVID-19 for myself, or the vast majority of people that I know, so fear is not playing into my emotions. The latest data from the Office of National Statistics and Prof. David Spiegelhalter (Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk) demonstrate that the risk of dying from COVID-19, once you have it, is very similar to your risk of dying across a normal 12 month period condensed into those few weeks, stratified by age. Thus I ask myself ‘am I usually particularly worried about dying in the next 12 months’? ‘Do I worry myself about my parents dying in the next 12 months?’ The answer to both is a resounding no! It would be truthful to say that I am frustrated about various aspects of lockdown, but am trying to accept them with a light heart. I very much miss hanging out in the city where I work and having scientifically-stimulating interactions with my colleagues, neither of which are replaceable with video calls. I had trips to Cambodia, the US and Latvia lined up for work that I was looking forward to and were necessary to drive things along that did not happen. It saddens me that international travel may not pick up for a very long time, given how culturally and scientifically enriching they are. I miss hugs and one-to-one in-person interactions with friends. I cannot exactly say that two months of lockdown has enamoured me of myself! The societal divides in terms of who is finding lockdown easier are very stark. Do you have access to a garden? Are you an elderly person living on their own? Do you have dependents to take care of? Have you lost your job? Do you run your own company? Have you been furloughed? Are you revelling in the fact that you do not need to commute? The middle classes are doing pretty well out of all this. To be strictly honest, I suppose the scientist in me is finding all this fascinating (and is also too overworked to think about anything too much). Although I am also incredibly bored of coronavirus taking over every aspect of life and would like things to go back to normal as soon as humanly possible, thank you very much. The government Pandemics are a fact of life; as a scientist in my field you simply accept that. Spanish ‘flu killed 50 million individuals (and infected about ten times that; nearly a third of the world). I deal with data nearly every day for another infectious condition from which more than a million people die per year. You analyse, you plan, you find the best solutions that you can. There is never a perfect and right answer. I know that some of the best and brightest minds we have are informing the UK government, as I have met or otherwise interacted with them. I also know that you cannot simply let the economy tank through coronavirus; lockdowns in themselves cost lives. So I do not wish to cast judgement on the decisions that the government has made, when to a certain extent we are all feeling our way through this S5767, female, 35, married, Gravesend, academic researcher together. (Although test and trace planning has been ludicrously running behind.) The one exception to this would be the Dominic Cummings fiasco, where the government has deliberately protected someone who drove an individual with COVID-19 (his wife) 260 miles to visit his parents, thus exposing society to the risk of infection from both her and his potentially infected child and self. All this took place during a time when we were prohibited from leaving our homes, if we had symptoms or had been exposed to someone who had. The government knew about this weeks ago (the story broke on the 22nd May) and yet chose to protect one of their own, despite the Scottish health minister and Prof. Neil Ferguson being forced out for much more minor infractions. Do I trust the government? Absolutely not. The government has set out a plan for what will happen over the next few months; almost inevitably this is not 100% clear, given that we still do not know an awful lot about the virus. I expect a gradual loosening of the lockdown restrictions, with schools reopening and a phased return of people to work (at the moment, individuals who cannot work from home have been allowed to return in England). For people who can work from home, business models could easily be changed forever; why keep expensive office estate when your workers can function comfortably elsewhere? News I am mainly relying on my scientific network for news and developments, as I do not trust the mass media to sensibly describe the latest discoveries and data. Saying this, I am reading the BBC News, The Guardian, and occasionally Aljazeera for more policy-related and political developments. I started out by listening to the daily briefings at 5pm, but this quickly became incompatible with my working hours. I do not know of anyone who has been challenged by not being able to access the news, but am wholly supportive of British Sign Language interpreters being present; it seems frankly negligent not to! Work and home life I have been working from home during lockdown, a prospect that is pretty much feasible. Sadly, recruitment to a research study of ours abroad has been halted and we do not know what our research funder will do about the lost time that we cannot make up with that work. For so many reasons, academia is very, very screwed going forwards; I suppose I am trying not to think about that. We are very fortunate in our household to have no dependents to take care of and plenty of space for both of us to work in separate rooms in the house, as well as a garden all to ourselves. TechnologyZoom and Microsoft Teams have become new features in my life for work, on top of Skye, which I used before. To be honest, with the levels of work (and the fact that I am an introvert) I have found video calling too tiring to use for socialising, and thus have only done so with one friend (three times). Otherwise, my use of social media has stayed pretty much the same (although obviously my work Twitter feed has exploded somewhat). Shopping and food We currently grocery shop weekly (which we largely did before), although now my husband and I go to one supermarket each in an attempt to buy everything we need. Queues are generally around 40 minutes long to get in and, in our town, there were shortages of flour and eggs for many weeks. Our current oddity in terms of stock-outs is icing sugar! Otherwise, our in-person shopping is restricted to trips to the pharmacy. Other outlets for spending (takeaway sandwiches, coffee) have been completely cut off. We are spending what feels like a chunk of money online, as we are fortunate enough not to stint, but I can still report that my bank statement for April was 1.5 pages in length, versus the usual 2.5! Our eating habits are largely unchanged, barring our new weekly indulgence in a takeaway dinner. S5767, female, 35, married, Gravesend, academic researcher Like many people, we did a bit of a binge-shop a few days before lockdown started, as it was obvious it was coming. Some thing we needed and had not got round to buying before (shoes for the husband, suitcases). Some thing we wanted on hand for entertainment (jigsaws from charity shops, second-hand books). Entertainment As both the husband and I are working long hours, neither of us have had much time for things outside of work and sleeping. In a new habit, I now run each weekday morning (previously, I was only doing this once a weekend), but neither of us have really taken up anything new apart from this. We have been chugging through our minor DIY tasks, but likely would have done this anyway. I have managed to get through three novels thus far: the latest Hilary Mantel, a book about Alexander the Great growing up, and one about the British concentration camps during the Boer War. Unsurprisingly, the latter did my mental health no good. Between us, we are watching/have watched Killing Eve, the 1970s version of War and Peace, Star Trek: Picard, Trigonometry (a BBC drama about polyamory-amazing to see this out!) and a documentary about Vienna. We have also rented a couple of films online. Personal hygieneNot much change here, aside from the fact I did not need to wear antiperspirant for about a month, until the weather got hot. A combination of not seeing people, not cycling (which I used to do two days a week to go to work) and the house being very cold!. SleepAside from the brief period of nightmare listed above, my sleep has not been affected by the coronavirus. Instead, I am doing my usual summer thing of waking up with the daylight."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. I think, considering my MH issues, I’m managing to cope remarkably well. There have been some down times, generally when it’s been a significant date, but on the whole I’ve taken one day at a time and tried to focus on what I can do, and not what I can’t. Now, in week 9, I find I’m more concerned about how I’m going to feel when things begin to move toward the new ‘normal’ rather than what’s going on today. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. No, although I would have liked to have seen my osteopath as my migraine and neck problems have been worse. They generally are in times of stress. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Stable in the main, I tend to be fairly pragmatic, but I have found myself getting angry more often. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? I’ve found some of these very hard to understand. The indecision about whether to go into lockdown when there were clear precedents elsewhere being a particular case in point. As was the ineptitude in ensuring sufficient supplies of PPE for the NHS and those working in Nursing Homes, which they then compounded by denying they had failed in this. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I would hope that all parties would be able to come together and deal with the crisis in an adult manner, putting people before politics. Unfortunately, there already seem to be signs that some are preparing to use the situation for their own gain. How quickly will they forget the key workers who got us through the pandemic? I truly hope there are enough politicians who will ensure the country takes whatever positives it can from the situation and uses them to everyone’s advantage. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? TV, Radio, some online media. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I did to begin with, but stopped as the constant repetition, and the usual political manoeuvring, became depressing. My husband continued for a while, but even he now only watches occasionally, preferring the late news instead. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Neither I, nor anyone I know has experienced this difficulty. My personal opinion is that any broadcast that is intended to disseminate important news to the public should have a BSL Interpreter as standard. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. As a writer I work from home so have not experienced any change of work space. My only problem has been not being able to visit a library. I can only get so far with my own books and those available online. Not being able to access the university collection has limited my research. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My husband is retired so our home life has continued as usual. Not being able to visit coffee shops or go to National Trust properties has been limiting, but we are lucky enough to have a garden, and the weather has been good. I think it would have been far more difficult had there been a wet and cold spring. We’ve been assisting with the home schooling of our granddaughter, who lives in the USA. It’s been challenging as she has ADD and confidence issues, but alongside her parents we’ve coped by wearing special hats for different subjects and have managed to get her to the end of term without too many tears. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? As I have family abroad and work from home I’m constantly using technology, so learning to use new systems hasn’t been an issue for me. Where I live we are very lucky in that we have a strong and reliable signal. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Using this tools has been a godsend. It’s meant that real life has been able to continue only in a different form. I’m still able to attend meetings, workshops and courses, whilst remaining at home. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? Although I’ve got access to these platforms I don’t use them very often and when I do it’s to escape. I’ll go on to look at posts within groups I’m a member of, rather than to look for news. I find there is far too much anger and divisiveness out there. Of the three I use Instagram most as I follow artists, writers and photographers on there which can be very soothing. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? I go shopping once a week and plan ahead. My only problem has been with fresh vegetables which we eat a lot of, and under normal circumstances often need to top up. At the moment I’m buying frozen ones to compensate. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Our cooking and eating habits have stayed the same apart from us now eating lunch at home every day. Before we would have had lunch out once or twice during the week. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? I write and read a lot during the day and, in the evenings, I knit. As a lockdown challenge I’ve been teaching myself to crochet. I’ve also picked up on my Latin again, something I’ve been learning on and off for a few years. With the good weather we’ve given the garden a makeover and cleared out the garage. Once we can go to the local recycling centre and the charity shop we’ll have twice the space we had before, and somewhere nice to enjoy the sunshine. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I listen to a lot of podcasts connected with history, writing and literature -In Our Time, Backlisted, The Bestseller Experiment, You’re Dead to Me. I read most things, and so far have read about twenty books ranging from Ursula K Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness to Dorothy L Sayers’ Whose Body? On TV we tend to watch mysteries, thrillers and some Sci-Fi. Killing Eve, Upload, Elementary, Vienna Blood and Wallender are all currently on our watch list. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I suppose they have in that I used to wash my hair every day but I’ve been experimenting with only washing it twice a week. I’ve heard that over time it stops it being so greasy. Lockdown has given me the chance to see if this is true. Other than that it’s pretty much the same except the timing is different. Showering at lunchtime is no longer out of the ordinary. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. As a long term insomniac nothing has changed for me. I haven’t experienced any more dreams than normal either, and nightmares have always been very rare. My husband hasn’t experienced any change either, but being retired he was used to not getting up at a set time. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? I’ve tried most things in the past which haven’t helped so I’m just continuing with my usual routine. Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Nothing unusual. I tend to dream about my family a lot and I suppose this has been more frequent."

My favourite form of exercise is walking (which I did most days pre-lockdown). Since lockdown began I generally only go for a walk once a week (and this is usually in conjunction with food shopping). This reduction is mainly because I feel somewhat anxious or ill at ease when out, which detracts from the pleasure I usually take from walking. So rather than potentially permanently associate anxiety with walking, I have cut back on this exercise. My husband falls within one of the higher risk categories as he takes an immune suppressant drug as part of his Crohns disease treatment, and luckily he has not experienced a flare up of his condition over lockdown, so has not required any medical help over the period. We neither have had any mental health issues, beyond a general anxiety about catching or passing on the virus, and the low level boredom of lockdown. My widowed father, who is in his early eighties, does however seem to have become frailer over the period. He lives independently, but does seem to be finding it more difficult to look after himself. This seems to be a mental health rather than physical issue, as he has become more isolated. I do speak to him every day on the telephone and visit once a week to drop off groceries, but I am worried about the effect the continued isolation will have long term (and whether there will be support in place to help him in the future). The government On the whole I am not impressed by the way in which the government has handled the situation, and think that other countries have been more successful in doing so. I am also not impressed however by the quality of political scrutiny from the media in this country, which seems to be based more around point scoring rather than proper scrutiny. Despite the rhetoric from all sides about ‘all being in this together’ as a country we seem to be becoming more and more polarised, which I think is potentially very dangerous. It is hard to predict, but I would imagine that the UK government will take steps to get people back to work. I am not fundamentally against this, as I think without this so many small businesses will disappear. What I do not have confidence in is that the government will do this in a planned manner. News I listen mainly to the BBC Breakfast news, and read the Guardian online and have started to buy a hard copy version of the Sunday Times. I also look online at the Robert Koch Institute and the WHO websites for reports on Covid19. I have not watched the 5pm government broadcasts, although I did watch the Boris Johnston broadcast from the 10th May on catch-up the following day. I am not aware of anyone who has had access challenges, but do support the use of a BSL interpreter. I have noticed that a number of other countries (including Scotland and Wales) do this, and think it is indicative of a lack of inclusiveness that the UK government broadcasts do not do this. Work and home life My experience of work during lockdown is perhaps different to many, in that I have gone from working part-time (2 days per week) to full-time work. This is because a new project has started during the lockdown period. I was not intending to work full-time but was concerned that the original project might be put on hold, and I was not sure, under the terms of the project contract if I could be furloughed. As it happens, the project has continued throughout and I have been working on it from home. This has positives and negatives. I am glad to have the additional income, but it has reduced my flexibility which actually feels more important now as I have some caring responsibilities for my elderly father. Although these are not onerous they are more difficult to carry out in the current situation. I also had made a conscious choice not to work full-time, so this is taking some adjustment. I do realise I am luckier than many, in that I do not have to carry out working from home alongside home schooling. My husband and I are used to spending our days together as we shared the same workspace in the past too, so there have not been too many additional challenges on this front. The inability to go out has raised some challenges, but we are lucky to have a large enough house so that we are not ‘on top of each other’ all day. There are times when we do get irritable with each other, but this is to be expected and we both try not to take things to heart. Technology I have had an increased use of technology, both for work and socially. For work this has been in the use of Zoom and Microsoft Teams to carry out meetings. I have also used Zoom as a way of ‘meeting up’ with groups of friends. This social use has helped greatly in dealing with lockdown. My husband has been using Skype to keep in contact with family in France and across the UK, and we both use WhatsApp and text to communicate daily with friends and family, sharing jokes, snippets of news and reactions to the lockdown and the government’s handling of the crisis. We have not taken part in ‘sing-along’s’ or online quizzes. Shopping and food We have been carrying out a large shop, driving to a large supermarket, about every 3 weeks, with a weekly visit to a more local shop for items such as bread and milk. The large shop has not been too stressful; although it is not enjoyable (I did previously enjoy browsing and taking my time). We have had to queue each time, for about 20 minutes, but the queue has been well managed, and people have been respecting social distancing. I have not worn a face mask, but do wear plastic gloves to handle the trolley. We have not used online deliveries. Initially this was so that those more in need (key workers, those shielding) would have a better chance of getting a delivery slot. As time has gone on, we have decided that a visit once every 3 weeks, respecting social distancing and sanitary precautions should not unduly compromise our health or others. Our cooking habits have changed slightly. We now cook more elaborate meals mid week, and my husband has taken the opportunity to try out more recipes. Our meals have stayed about the same health-wise, and we have tried to stay away from unhealthy snacking during the day. We probably do eat more snacks in the evening (e.g. some crisps or cheese and crackers) than we would normally do. Entertainment and leisure I have not done anything new that I would not normally have done, but (prior to working full-time) I had more time in which to do it. I have taken part in online sewing webinars, and am in the middle of doing a MoMa fashion course via Coursera. The time spent on this has been made available as I would probably have been out walking or ‘wasting time’ browsing in shops. I have been watching DVDs of Miami Vice, and films on MUBI. We have also watched Schitt’s Creek, Ozarks, Bosch on Netflix, and Seinfeld on All4. I have also watched ‘classic’ films on BBC iPlayer. I read every day. Currently, I have been tending to read ‘golden age’ crime stories. I had started re-reading Orwell’s 1984 as lockdown started, but had to abandon this as I was finding it too depressing in the current circumstances. Personal hygiene My habits have remained the same on the whole. I am not changing my clothes as often as they are not getting as dirty as they are not being worn outside. I have stopped wearing make-up. I would normally do this every time I went out but have now stopped. I think that I will probably wear it on far fewer occasions in the future, as I realise it had just become a habit rather than something I wanted or needed to do. Sleep Initially I was sleeping much better than normal, as I think I had a focus for my anxiety (COVID19) that could be managed (by taking the suggested precautions). As lockdown has gone on the anxiety about COVID19 has become ‘normalised’ and I have been sleeping less well on some nights as old anxieties have come to the fore. I know that my sister who is a more anxious person than I am generally was also sleeping much better at the start of the crisis. I have not had any COVID19 related dreams that I remember, but one of my friends has and continues to have, where the virus is something that is following her around."

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health I am really fortunate to enjoy very good health and have far fewer problems than my husband and daughters. Early on during lockdown, I had a very mild cold but lost my sense of taste. For many weeks, it only partially returned. Very recently, loss of smell or taste has been added to the list of Covid19 symptoms on which people are supposed to act by self-isolating. At around the same time, E (21 year old daughter) was briefly unwell and had cough. She was self-isolating in her room anyway, having returned home from her student house, and decided she wanted to self-isolate in her room, though that wasn’t strictly necessary. (After the first couple of weeks, she moved in with her boyfriend and his family, as she was too anxious at the prospect of her sister returning to work at the hospital.) Have we both had Covid? We can’t know. I’ve been reporting symptoms, or lack of them, most days (it’s supposed to be daily but I sometimes forget) through the Covid19 symptom tracker app, to provide data on Covid. O (19 year old daughter) had just been referred by her for a first cardiac outpatients appointment when we entered lockdown, but that is on hold. She’d been experiencing some odd heart rhythms. Hopefully there is nothing seriously wrong… She and my husband T have some long-term mental health problems and both have had a telephone consultation with their GP during lockdown, which has worked fine. What doesn’t work well is filling in an online form for the GP practice, to indicate that you need to consult a GP and giving reasons why. O did this on two occasions, not emergencies, and both times it told her she needed to go to A&E or call 999 immediately! So she gave up on that and phoned the GP practice instead. Both O and T have experienced swings in their moods and T is currently anxious and low. O usually has quite big variations in her moods and on the whole I think she’s been coping surprisingly well, given the uncertainties and the suspension of all her activities. She has been at college part time this year and working on a maternity unit part time – but the local college made no contact once we went into lockdown, and she is currently not allowed to do her job, as she is considered at too high risk from Covid19 given her asthma. She did have a big low the other week, feeling that she couldn’t bear lockdown any longer. She was very keen to go to join friends in Swansea, including the young man with whom she was enjoying a new romance during lockdown through long chats on FaceTime. This hugely increased our stress, anticipating all the problems with that, both actual (illegal for starters) and potential (she could get ill there, might jeopardise her job and future career, we and her sister would all feel anxious, and so on). We had a difficult conversation with her and there was a falling out between her and T. We were relieved when she dropped the idea but it’s still in the back of my mind that she could dip that low again and do something rash. Having said that, I normally have good mental health and am emotionally pretty level, but there have been other times recently when I have felt low and anxious, as a result of the current situation. It has also been hard, much of the time, to find the motivation to go out for walks (even though it’s my favourite time of year, we have lovely places to walk and the weather has been wonderful!) or to do things that, in theory, I want to do. Lots of other people have said the same. I read this on Twitter recently (I’m afraid I can’t give a source, it came from someone who said their wife told them this) and it resonated with me: 'Crises have 3 psychological phases: 1. Emergency: Shared clear goals and urgency makes us feel energised, focused and even productive. 2. Regression (and most of us are here right now): We realise the future is uncertain, lose sense of purpose, get tired, irritable, withdrawn and less productive. 3. Recovery: we begin to reorient, revise our goals, expectations, roles and begin to focus on moving beyond vs getting by.” I certainly feel I’m in stage 2, though I feel better than I did a week ago. We’ve also been bereaved during this period. My lovely mum, whom we all loved so very much, died on 12th April, Easter Sunday (good timing Mum, the most important day in the church calendar!). She had been declining with dementia, but we were surprised that this was clearly accelerating in the early part of this year and we found ourselves facing the likelihood that she would soon have to go into residential care. In fact, on our last trip before lockdown, a couple of days before, T and I were returning to Oxford from London, and on the coach I opened an email from my sister with the title “It’s time”, with the latest news of Mum and meaning it was time to look for residential care. My heart sank at that. Mum was being beautifully cared for by her wonderful live-in carer, S, supported by two kind visiting carers, one of whom Mum had known and loved for years (she used to be her cleaner). Her wish was always to die peacefully at home and this is what happened. She wasn’t even acutely ill; her death certificate gives dementia as the cause of death. It became apparent that Mum was likely to die soon and S kept in close contact with us via WhatsApp. Of course, we couldn’t go and see her, not even my sister A, who lived nearby, because of the conditions of lockdown. Although this was hard, we were conscious too that there would have been hard things about seeing her, and especially for our daughters. We were relieved that she wasn’t missing us, and we are so very grateful that she was cared for so tenderly to the last and died so peacefully at home, as she wished. Although we’re really sad, we’re so grateful for all she has been spared, both the horrors of decline and from the difficulties of lockdown restrictions – especially if she had had to go into a home, from which we’d be barred from entering. That would have been incredibly stressful and distressing for us and quite possibly for Mum. Mum was cremated with no-one in attendance. My two sisters and I quickly agreed on that. We couldn’t have imagined this just a few weeks before. Unthinkable! Mum’s wishes were few – a Christian ceremony and some people to say some nice things about her. We haven’t managed that, but we will, eventually. I think the alternative would have been for just my local sister and her husband to attend. Mum’s siblings wouldn’t have been allowed, given their ages, and we and my other sister are too far away to have gone for the day – and not allowed to use public transport. This seemed a worse prospect, so we opted for ‘direct cremation’. I also had in mind the very recent experience of friends of ours, who had to attend a relative’s funeral via video link, with just a few people present at the funeral. They had found this quite distressing, especially being able to see family members there, upset, and not be able to do anything to comfort them. It was a comfort to me that on the day of Mum’s cremation I knew some of my friends and family were praying and a group from my church gathered on Zoom to pray for her and us, which I was really touched by. Early in the 6thmorning (we didn’t know what time the cremation would take place, only the day – May), E and I spent time together on FaceTime, talking about Mum, and we each read out something we’d written – E a poem and me a letter written as if to Mum. We lit candles and blew them out at the end. Later in the morning, T, O and I did something similar here. These things were comforting. My eldest sister, D, who lives on the west coast of Ireland, sent us some photos and a video of what they’d done that day. Her partner A made a cardboard boat and they made an ‘offering of flowers’. A put in a marigold for Ganesh, who is said to smooth one's journey, and a sandalwood incense cone. D put in pink flowers plus five sprigs of forget-me-not: three to represent Mum's daughters and two to represent her siblings. D waded out into the water and set the boat on its way. It headed off into the West and they watched it for a good while. D also put words on the beach -WITH GRATITUDE, M [name], MOTHER – SISTER, PEACE, LOVE AND LIGHT, ALWAYS, while A drew a huge mandala in the sand. Our sister A said she hadn’t come up with anything to do and that seemed a shame for her; she’s in lockdown with her husband and I think he wouldn’t have thought of doing anything ceremonial. I have found it comforting to think of creative ways we could commemorate and celebrate Mum’s life, and of what we might do when we can finally have a gathering. I am beginning to wonder if this will even happen this year though. It will be good when we can go to her flat. Although sad, I think this is part of the grieving process. T, E and O have all said they would like to do this. This too has to wait. I think it will be fascinating to learn, in the years ahead, about the political, social and economic changes of this time, precipitated or shaped by the pandemic. Some will be transient and others will endure in one form or another, I imagine. Death in the time of Covid is different; we’re creating new rituals, for one thing. I feel we have been fortunate in our experience of Mum’s death, both for her and for ourselves. I’ve read of terrible experiences of people dying alone, or in hospitals and care homes with no loved one with them, relatives saying their goodbyes via phones, ipads and so on. Many people will be terribly traumatised not only by the death of loved ones but by the manner of it, the circumstances around it, and the loss of rituals and ceremonies that were important to them. Just one facet of the many difficult things Covid and the restrictions imposed have brought with them. The Government It’s hard to know where to begin when it comes to talking about the political decisions that have been made! I didn’t vote for this government, am strongly opposed to Brexit and had no respect for Johnson (the Prime Minister) before all this, but I feel they really have plumbed depths I wouldn’t have imagined. Their handling of it has been utterly shambolic. Other nations, if they’re looking at us at all, must be incredulous. How can they be getting it so wrong? At the time of writing, we have possibly the highest rate of excess deaths from Covid in the world. How can that be?! Their handling of the pandemic so far has been characterised by delay, deceit, and putting political considerations before scientific ones, posturing and politicking before public health. Their communications have been appalling. Their change of message from “Stay home” to “Stay alert, control the virus, save lives” in May, with a few lockdown measures eased, was met with derision. How exactly are we to stay alert? And control the virus? It instantly gave rise to memes, of course (some have been collected here https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/stay-alert-memes-boris-johnson­lockdown-update-a4436921.html) . At least people’s sense of humour is alive and well, and funny responses to political blunders over the weeks have given us a little light relief. In recent times, they have blatantly gone against scientific advice. They’re not even bothering to conceal lies, or explain them. Many people feel they were slow to put us into lockdown and our now easing restrictions too soon, when “the science” doesn’t support it, although of course “the science” actually covers a variety of best guesses (1m, 1.5 or 2m for social distancing, for instance?). Johnson has silenced the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance, flanking him at some of the press conferences, when it hasn’t suited him to let them answer. Apparently Chris Whitty refused to reduce the alert level from 4 to 3 last weekend, but the government went ahead on ‘Happy Monday’ by easing some of the restrictions, moves that had been listed as appropriate for when we reach level 1, the lowest risk category. Johnson appears to be more incoherent than ever, when he appears at all. He was hospitalised with Covid early on; no wonder, as the government were mixing and mingling when they should have known better. Now the odious Jacob Rees-Mogg (MP), who appears like a visiting ghost from the Victorian aristocracy, has succeeded in enforcing a return to Westminster for MPs to vote, despite the utter folly of that in terms of infection risk (and the long distance travel that many will have to undertake to get there and home again) and on the first day one of the MPs was showing signs of illness. Sports such as horse racing have started again this week. What nonsense! An economic decision of course. I was surprised they were so slow to stop big gatherings for sports. O and I were in Liverpool on 10th and 11th March, a week before lockdown, as she had a university interview. As we left, vast crowds were due to arrive for an international football match. We were well aware that Covid was a growing concern in the UK by then and astonished that it was going ahead. Public confidence in the government fell even further with the fiasco of the Cummings affair a couple of weeks ago. Dominic Cummings is Johnson’s key advisor, long portrayed in the media as a powerful psychopath behind the PM. It emerged that during lockdown, in April, he’d made a trip to Durham with his wife and child, going to his parents’ house for help with childcare, as they were both ill with Covid/suspected covid and, while there, a 60 mile round daytrip to Barnard Castle (apparently to test his eyesight, which gave rise to both incredulity and derision!). There were many flagrant floutings of the rules he had helped create, regarding travel during lockdown and clearly he should have resigned, or been sacked, as others have had to do for breaches (CMO for Scotland among them). The thing rumbled on and there was then a ludicrous press conference, where DC explained himself and took questions. Lies were piled upon lies and confusion upon rules that were supposedly clear. Once again, people managed to find humour in it and had a field day on social media. He gave us all plenty of material. However, people have been left very angry. No apology, no resignation or sacking. The line taken was “he did what any concerned parent would do”, but millions of us as concerned parents, or concerned people with sick relatives, have followed the rules and stayed away. This line of argument makes us look like fools. People are furious that it’s “one rule for ‘them’ and one rule for ‘us’”. Extraordinary that Johnson has compromised so much, including the public health message, to save his advisor. I was moved to write to Robert Courts, our (Tory) MP, calling for him to condemn Cumming’s actions, but he spoke out in support of him. I had a cut-and-paste response with no effort to personalise it, not mentioning Mum’s death, which I had cited in my short email to him. Many, many MPs received emails about this and some Tory MPs did speak out against Cummings. He has survived thus far, but lockdown was immediately compromised and there was a noticeable shift in people’s willingness to comply. It’s surely related to this that the government moved swiftly to ease some of the lockdown restrictions when scientific advisors didn’t support it. It is thought we are in for a second wave of infection and there is such a lack of confidence in the government’s handling of it all. Our infection rates are still awful. Primary schools were supposed to be admitting years 1 and 6 in ‘bubbles’, with other social distancing measures’, but many have simply not done this and now there is a U-turn on this, with schools not expecting to be fully functioning (if then) until the new academic year in September. There has been a rumbling debate about whether mask-wearing by the general public should be recommended or mandatory, and under what circumstances. Now the World Health Organisation (WHO) has changed it stance in favour of masks, saying recent evidence is in the direction of supporting mask wearing. It is to be compulsory on public transport from 15th June and the WHO recommends wearing them in other places indoors where social distancing is difficult. As someone who relies on lipreading, this is going to complicate life for me (and many others). I think the government will take steps in the weeks and months ahead to open things up and establish a ‘new normal’, driven primarily by economic and political interests rather than scientific ones. There is talk of local lockdowns in response to infection rates and so they may do that. It’s hard to anticipate what this ‘new normal’ might be. Many things that I would like to resume feel like they may be a long way off. I try not to look ahead too much, but focus on the day in hand. I’m not terribly good at that, but I try. News I check the BBC and The Guardian online in the morning and later in the day, including to see if there was anything significant said at the 5pm broadcast – but not every day. I have watched very few of the live broadcasts, not easy for me anyway as I largely rely on captions/subtitles. I did watch it when the Cummings thing broke though, glued to it! I was tweeting in response to it too, during the broadcast. It was interesting that over that weekend, at the height of attention on the Cummings fiasco, I was a fairly avid consumer of that news, fascinated to see how it would play out, but T said consuming news was contributing to his anxiety so I said I wouldn’t talk to him about it. Failing to provide a BLS interpreter was yet another thing the government got wrong and have been very slow to introduce. Quite right that Nicola Sturgeon’s broadcasts have been signed. They so often seem to do things better in Scotland than here! I see Twitter every day so I see some news and responses to it there, and click through if there’s an article that sounds interesting. Work and home life T and I have both been working from home during lockdown. I feel grateful that we are not among those who have lost jobs or income during this time, and the change is less for us than some, as we are both used to working at home some of the time. I generally worked at home two days a week and spent three in the office. Early on in lockdown, the caretaker of our building, who happens to live near me, kindly delivered my office chair, and I moved O’s unwanted desk into ‘my’ room – a room I use for crafts and storing things and that can be turned into a guest bedroom when needed. So this is now my office, although I sometimes bring my laptop downstairs and work at the dining room table or in the sitting room, on the sofa. I can do my job perfectly well from home, and I’m aware that cutting out the travelling gives me more time to do other things. But I miss seeing my lovely colleagues, whom I think of as my ‘work family’. I miss the chat over the kettle, or sitting together at lunchtime. I miss talking with A, who sits next to me and who has been my friend for about 25 years! I miss popping to the shops at lunchtime and A and I were eagerly anticipating the arrival of a new bookshop near work this spring. I miss the laughs with S, whose job is most closely aligned with mine. However, S and I are able to work well together via Zoom, which gives us the chance to chat a bit and have some laughs. Slack is also good – it’s a messaging platform that we’re all on, which enables us to have a bit of chat and banter, as well as exchange information relating to work. We’ve had a couple of Friday evening Zoom socials too – cocktail-making demonstrations! Other meetings are also being held via Zoom. It’s very good that we can do this, but it’s not as good as being together. I miss choosing clothes to wear to work and admiring other people’s; chatting with T (colleague) about clothes we’ve seen online, or perhaps bought. I miss the variety of being in different places. During lockdown, I have missed two planned work trips to Ireland, and I’m sad that I’ve missed out on those, both for the pleasure of being with colleagues and the work we’d have done but also because T and I were going to add on a bit of holiday to both trips and I would have gone to stay with my sister as part of of one of them. Some of the time it’s been quite hard to be motivated to get on with work and I’ve been less productive than normal. Colleagues have said the same thing. I’m not sure why this is so, but it seems a common experience. There’s something about not having the stimulus of being among colleagues; all the incidental bits of information shared and ideas discussed when we’re together. I’ve worked best when I’ve been doing that on zoom with S and we’re making good progress on a project. It’s hard to imagine when it will be possible to be in the office again, though how and when this might be possible is starting to be talked about. We can do everything from home, and I’m reliant on public transport so it might take longer for me to get back than others. Colleagues with children of school age and younger have definitely been feeling the strain. I’m grateful we’re not at that stage and having to grapple with home schooling, though there were times when home schooling would have been a blessed relief for our girls compared with going to school! I am very aware of our good fortune in having a big comfortable house with plenty of space, where we can be together or have time alone. We have a garden too. It’s been fine being together, on the whole, though moods have been up and down and this can affect the others in the house of course. We’re aware that this is a terrible time for so many, who live in poor conditions, who have abusive relationships and so on. We are very fortunate, with nothing worse to deal with than a bit of irritation, or the usual stresses that are (in my experience) part of being a parent! T was driving me a bit mad the other day, in a mood to talk at great length, as he does, until in the end I had to say that I couldn’t listen any more to details of drill bits and shall we go and watch television?! Lockdown has been hard on O and I worry about it. She’s had just about every aspect of her life disrupted, including the college course she should have been completing (not been possible as they have made no contact since the beginning of lockdown) and her job at the hospital, which she’s not allowed to do at the moment because of concern about her risk from covid as someone with asthma. She is hoping to be able to take up a university place but it remains to be seen if they will admit her without the college course being completed and to the required standard. We really hope so… She misses her friends terribly, although of course they keep in touch via FaceTime etc, and she misses her usual social life. E has fared better, lockdown having relieved her of the pressure to go out and socialise, which she often doesn’t want to do. She has enjoyed talking to friends over FaceTime or by other means, and of course has spent most of lockdown with her boyfriend and his family. I’m very relieved that she has managed to complete her university work (this is her final year), but her future plans are also in disarray and she expects to have to return home for a while and take stock. She had planned to get a job and get a flat with her boyfriend in their university town for his final year there. Technology Work has been conducted in the usual ways through email and Slack, the latter allowing us some scope for chatting too, with the only change in our use of technology there being to use Zoom (a video conferencing platform) regularly for meeting and collaborating, which I have done very occasionally in the past for the odd meeting. We have also used it for two social meetings with colleagues, as mentioned before. I have newly used Zoom for social meetings with friends. Three of us have been meeting as a book group for about 15 years or so (there used to be more of us) and we have now met twice on Zoom, which has been lovely, if not as good as meeting in person. I’ve also joined in a Zoom chat with some of my nursing cohort, and E and I have used it for her to share sections of her work (sharing her s screen so I could see it) and ask for my comments As at all other times, my friendships have been really important to me at this time and also my family, especially my sisters. My sisters and I have exchanged emails, as usual, but as recent adopters of smartphones (they are dinosaurs!) we have been able to exchange messages and photos by WhatsApp and have been using this more than email. I’ve also been enjoying exchanging emails with my uncle, which we did sometimes before lockdown, currently sharing information relating to our family history. At the very beginning of lockdown, my friend G, who lives five minutes walk from me, emailed and suggested we exchange emails every day, saying:“What I am thinking is to share with you some of my concerns, but also every day to write three positive things about my day and share those with you. Would you like to do the same? That way we can share some positives with each other and hope it helps to keep us on a more even keel.” We have been doing this ever since, over eighty days now, and it has helped us both very much. I really look forward to emailing G and receiving her emails. We have met in person once, sitting in her garden 2m apart for a while one evening, and that was so good. I am not keen on Facebook, but I am using it in lockdown mostly to access live Jazzercise (exercise) sessions, which our local instructors are providing. I’m using FaceTime to talk to one friend and to E. Chatting to people via screens is a bit of a mixed experience for me. When it works well, I like it, but as I rely on lipreading to supplement my hearing it doesn’t work if the picture freezes or becomes even fractionally out of sync with the sound. However, I am a sociable creature and appreciate all forms of contact. I have a couple of friends with whom I use Snapchat, so that has carried on as before. I also use Instagram and Twitter and my use of those hasn’t changed, as social platforms but Twitter also as a place for conversation and to find articles of interest relating to my work and (to a lesser extent) my leisure interests. I do send occasional letters and also cards (for birthdays and at other times) in the post but have felt unsure whether some people might be worried about the potential for contamination by covid on the mail. I’ve sent birthday cards though, and I have also really enjoyed sending gifts to a few friends, not prompted by birthdays but just for wanting to give them a little treat and let them know I’ve been thinking about them. I’m sure this has given me just as much pleasure as it has given them. I spotted a book online, for instance, that I thought a friend would like, so sent it to her. I’ve also sent flowers, and have been delighted to receive flowers from several people, some prompted by Mum’s death or my birthday, but I also had flowers randomly from a school friend with whom I normally exchange birthday and Christmas cards, but we have not exchanged any gifts since school nor met since our twenties! I must remember this after lockdown and send more gifts not linked to birthdays or Christmas; I am fortunate to have the disposable income to enable me to do it. Shopping and food Before lockdown, we had a delivery of organic fruit and vegetables perhaps three weeks in four and about two deliveries of groceries bought online each month. We’d supplement these with lots of small purchases at the Co-op, a minute’s walk from the house. I often said I’d have to be much more organised and plan better if I lived some distance from the shops (as one of my sisters does – she has to drive four miles for the nearest shop of any kind!). We would also sometimes go to a bigger supermarket in the middle of Witney, perhaps because we hadn’t planned what we would have or got round to ordering online. Online shopping has been something we’ve done, if only for some of our shopping, for a long time, so I was amazed to learn that before lockdown online grocery shopping was an incredibly small proportion of all grocery shopping -something like 7%. However, we haven’t got a car, and even when we did we didn’t use it more than very rarely to do food shopping, so I suppose we are unusual. At the beginning of lockdown, or when it was coming, there was panic-buying of many things, and it was utterly bizarre to go into Waitrose and see the fruit and vegetable areas largely empty. There was a highly advertised rush on loo roll and flour, oh and hand sanitizer could not be bought from very early on, though it seems to have made a reappearance now. Retailers were cashing in too. M&S, I saw in the news, was selling a bottle of hand sanitizer for £11! It’s normally cheap stuff. I discovered early on that we are well stocked, despite my self-image as someone who is disorganised about shopping. I suppose I’m aware of the contrast with my rural sisters; if there’s an urgent need for a toothbrush, they must have spares in their cupboards, where I’ve always been able to just nip out and buy one, from very early in the morning to very late at night. So we have not had a shortage of food or other essentials, though it felt possible that we might and, like others, whilst not panic-buying or getting large quantities of anything, I think we overbought in March. I certainly spent a lot more! At the start of lockdown, it wasn’t possible to get delivery slots with Ocado (our usual online shop) or with Riverford (veg box), but these quite quickly opened up. Riverford has reduced their selection to cope with current challenges and we have set up a weekly order, and we now have some scope to change our selection if we want to. We’ve also been placing weekly orders with Ocado. New for us in lockdown, we have been getting fortnightly deliveries of local eggs, to which local strawberries have now been added. We are really appreciating all this and intend to keep it going beyond lockdown. We have only needed very occasional forays to the Co-op and have been only once to Waitrose I think. Mostly I have walked past the long queues for Waitrose and been thankful I didn’t have to shop these. T says he has noticed the silence around these queues – people not talking to each other, whether masked or not. I wondered if this would be different in other places, reflecting a rather unsociable local culture, but T thinks it is fear of breathing coronavirus on each other. Just before lockdown, we were pleased by the arrival in Witney of a small shop. Wast0 (which we refer to as Waste-O, to the amused annoyance of E, though we know full well it’s zero not O!) where you can buy products loose, taking your own packaging, and it is good that this has remained open and we have been able to use it. Aside from the benefits of no packaging, it has been a source of flour, which has been largely unobtainable online. They have restricted the number of people in it at one time and, since the WHO guidance on masks changed, I wore a cloth mask when I went in last time (bought there actually, on a previous visit. I paid £5 and by this visit the price had been put up to £6.50!). I was surprised at how unpleasant it was to wear it and was glad to take it off when I got outside. Our eating and cooking habits haven’t significantly changed, although I think I’m"

Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Fortunately, neither I nor the person I live with have been unwell with COVID-19. I live with someone who has COPD and is therefore at a higher risk if he were to contact COVID-19. Keeping him safe has been the prime focus of the last three months so we have both been inside for most of the day during lockdown to limit chances of either of us catching the coronavirus. His life hasn’t really changed much as he has been dealing with chronic fatigue and COPD for about 5 years, which has meant he has hardly been out for a long, long time. For me, however, I have had to get used to a much more physically restricted lifestyle. Before the lockdown I walked a great deal, went to dance lessons, and was a generally active person. We live in a small flat with only a bedroom and one other room, so staying in has been tough both physically (my back aches badly) and psychologically. There is not even really any space to walk around inside the flat. Working from home has been tricky as I don’t have space for a desk or chair to work at. I know I am fortunate, however, to have a job that enables me to still work at home. My mental health would be much worse if I lost my job, that is certain. I have clinical depression and have had for many years, so I am quite used to dealing with it and have managed to keep my health relatively under control during lockdown. I think the enforced slowing down and reduction of social contact has actually had a positive effect on my mental health. It feels like a relief to not have to deal with as many people as usual. I feel quite bad writing that as the circumstances leading to that feeling are so terrible, but I have found that side of lockdown beneficial. My emotions have been all over the place though, as have my energy levels. Sometimes calm, sometimes anxious, other times very tired and weary. I assume this is not uncommon during this time of such uncertainty. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made?  What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months?  I can hardly write about the government’s handling of the pandemic without ranting. I feel despair at our government, at their slow response, their deceit, their willingness to allow care home staff and residents to suffer, and now their too-soon easing of lockdown. The furlough scheme is a good thing and has helped lots of people I know. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian Unfortunately, I think over the coming months the government will behave with the same carelessness and alter the remaining lockdown measures far too quickly. I fear for a second wave of the virus. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this?  At the start of the pandemic I was watching the 5pm broadcasts daily as I was keen to keep informed and felt I needed to know what the latest rules and rates of infection were. However, within about two weeks of lockdown, I found the whole experience so disheartening and at times infuriating (depending on which government minister was talking) that I decided to stop watching. I hardly watch any news now, as a means of actively avoiding the COVID talk, as the constant rolling news relies so much on speculation that it can become frustrating and anxiety-inducing in equal measure. Instead, I read the bullet point headlines in the papers the next day, and see if there is any new information or rules I need to understand – otherwise, I steer clear of it all. I fully support the inclusion of BSL for the briefings. I have hearing loss and use subtitles for all television. I am not a BSL user but for many deaf people this is their main language. It makes absolute sense to have an interpreter to ensure the deaf community receive correct information. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with?  How have you managed these challenges?  I am an academic librarian so work in a university library, which is located in a building shared by other university departments. The entire university closed a few days before the official lockdown began and I have been working from home ever since. I am extremely fortunate that I can do this as so many people are either still having to go to work as they are key workers, and are risking their health, or have lost their jobs entirely. I am extremely lucky to have a job that can be adapted to home working. Although I can by no means undertake all my work from home – I manage book collections, for instance, which are currently also in lockdown and that side of my job has had to cease – I can do a large percentage of it. For example, much of my job includes research and writing about the collections so I have done a great deal of this – writing blog posts, researching new collection areas, copyediting, Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian creating a book index – and other parts of my job which would normally happen in person are now being undertaken online, such as library inductions for new students. These latter I am planning via MS Teams and online training. I have been investigating the best ways in which to do that. I am also talking at online conferences. Working from home has always been possible with my job to a limited extent but before lockdown I hardly made use of it preferring to keep a distinction between my work and home. However, now I have been forced in to this position, I think I would like to maintain it to some extent once we return to regular patterns again. I would ideally like to work half the week in the library and half from home. When I say ‘work from home’ I would probably want to work from the public library, ideally, which is 5 minutes away from my flat. This is because the hardest part about working from home has been the tiny size of our flat which I share with one other person. We have no space for a desk or chair so I have bought a collapsible dining chair which I can fold-up each night, and each day I clear a bit of space on a table which is in the kitchen. This table has many objects covering it and each day I therefore move lots of stuff onto other kitchen surfaces to make my working space. This can be a tricky situation both for my back and neck and general comfort but also for the person I live with. He is always at home due to ongoing health problems and I sometimes feel I have invaded his daily routine with my presence, although he in no way complains. He has had to adapt to me being here – the size of our flat means he also has to endure the online library meetings that I go to, for instance, and where I sit blocks the toaster and the sink. I am also getting weary with the non-stop screen-based work, and writing so much. I miss the variety of my job which normally includes working with students in person and books, and moving around both mentally and physically much more than I can do now. I also miss not being out and about in London. Life has narrowed to two rooms. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? Oh goodness, yes, the endless technology of lockdown! I have been using new technology primarily for work as I work in higher education and we have all been thinking about how we can move our student-facing work online. As such, I have been testing Zoom and MS Teams and working out ways I can run my student sessions online next year. All the library meetings have been run via MS Teams. Thankfully, we all decided from the start that we didn’t want to use webcams so we Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian can’t see each other, only hear each other. I was very relieved about this, partly as I don’t want my home space broadcast to my colleagues (I still want to keep some barriers between home and work) and partly as I have taken to wearing very casual clothing while at home. I have hearing loss so find concentration is hard during online meetings but I can use closed captions on MS Teams, which are quite hilarious at times (they don’t always respond very accurately to our accents!). With my family I have had a couple of Zoom calls but these have been quite strange as my mum has a funny laptop and appears as a ghost – we can hardly see her – but it is good to see my little niece and nephews as I miss them greatly. At the start of lockdown, my closest friends and I – we are a group of 4 – started having Skype chats every weekend but, after about a month, these dwindled and stopped. We all found the forced routine of it tiring and we have now gone back to our normal way of communicating which is daily via our WhatsApp group. I find communicating via Zoom, Skype or Teams utterly exhausting and, now, quite stressful. When I am not required to talk, I turn off my mic and tend to try and zone in and out as necessary. Regarding social media – I am relatively active on Twitter but I have avoided reading or posting anything about COVID-19 and continue using it just as I did beforehand, which is to post about books, and art and London history and folklore as I normally do. I always avoid politics on Twitter (it is the only way to enjoy it, I think) and have made no changes to that area. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Living where I do, in Zone 2 of North London, I have been so fortunate to have access to food. The main issue has been social distancing which has been impossible in many local shops which are very small. As a result, for the first time in my life I have turned to online shopping to do a ‘big shop’ once a month. I have found Asda to be the easiest to use as their booking system is manageable, they have also been really reliable, and the people delivering have been great. For fresh food and items that I need in between Asda deliveries, I go out at 6am to a local shop which, amazingly, has retained its 24-hour opening regime. I only buy from Asda what I cannot get at this local shop. At 6am I am usually the only customer. It has very narrow aisles, as do all our local shops, so I don’t go any later as it very quickly is crowded and social distancing impossible. There is one other local shop I have used which I can go to during the afternoon in emergencies – this shop is also nearby and has been undertaking really good social distancing policies from the word go, only letting in three people at a time. It is a very small shop but they have been great at keeping everyone safe. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian At the start of lockdown, after all the panic buying, lots of things I would normally buy were unavailable especially vegetarian food: Quorn products disappeared entirely and are only now coming back into stock. Otherwise, nothing much has been a problem and my diet hasn’t changed in the main. I suppose the biggest difference for me is that as I am not at work I don’t eat the sort of lunches I used to, which were things bought from the work café, and I also went to local cafes every weekend for my breakfast – it was my weekly treat – and I really, really miss this. Nothing I cook at home replicates the pleasure I feel eating breakfast in a café. I love cafes, dearly, and cannot wait until they are open and it is safe to return to them. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have beeen watching, listening to and/or reading. In addition to work, I am in the middle of a research degree in English literature so I have spent a large part of lockdown reading novels, academic texts and archival material relating to my project. I do still have time – I ensure I do – for leisure reading and, to give myself a mental contrast, have plumped for lots of books that I enjoy and find page-turners rather than the academic works I have to slowly plough through. I enjoy supernatural and gothic stories, and have been reading some new-ish examples of these including Laura Purcell’s novels and also Bunny by Mona Awad. I find this a really enjoyable escape and can curl up and read for hours. My brother also gave us a Netflix login which we have made very good use of. We have watched repeats of old comedies such as Alan Partridge, dramas like Jonathan Creek, and films by Orson Welles. We have watched new series and really loved After Life, Unorthodox, and Shtisel. We have loads more lined up. We also love the Talking Pictures TV channel and watch films on there quite a bit. I have not taken up any new interests as I find it hard enough keeping up with what I normally do. I am a clog dancer and this, unfortunately, has had to cease for the time being as I live in a tiny flat surrounded by neighbours so I can never practice at home (clogs are loud!). I normally practiced at work. I miss this – the practice and the lessons – and really cannot wait to start dancing again. I also do cross stitch and have had a piece ongoing for ages, but have not made any particular progress during lockdown. For ten years I have been doing a photography project – I take one photo a day and upload it to Flickr. I have continued doing this over lockdown and have tried to take pictures which represent something of the nature of the lockdown on the streets around where I live. I have hundreds of these project photos from the last few years, which still need labelling. I thought during lockdown I might have done this but I have been too busy and / or sleepy. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian I have started one new little project, a small Instagram account where I put images and text daily about pamphlets, zines and booklets that I have in the flat. I love this kind of do-it-yourself publishing and am hoping to share this with others who do too. The radio is on a great deal in our flat. I enjoy listening to old comedies such as Round the Horne. I haven’t listened to much music, but occasionally have put some on in the background, mainly while I am doing housework. I don’t feel much like listening to music at the moment, though. Mainly, my escape has been a mix of Netflix and spooky novels. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My personal hygiene has become a sort of obsession with me during lockdown. I have been so scared of bringing the virus into the flat that I keep a set of ‘outdoor’ clothes in a carrier bag by the front door and have a shower every time I have been outside the flat, even if it is just to go downstairs to the bottom of the block to get the post (which does not entail going outside in to the streets). I have been washing my hands and using sanitiser gel after I touch pretty much anything that is not in my flat, and use disposable gloves, too. If I were living alone, I would not be so obsessive about it – would just stick to normal lockdown guidelines – but I am so scared of affecting the person I live with and his health that I am somewhat nervous about keeping the virus at bay. On the other hand, I have become much slobbier about my clothing and general appearance. As we don’t use the webcam for work meetings, and my friends don’t care what I look like, I have been wearing slouchy clothes indoors – pyjamas, mainly, to be honest. My hair is getting big – it grows out before it grows down – and I have not dyed my roots, leaving them for when I can go to the hairdresser again. I love lipstick and normally wear it all the time but I haven’t worn lipstick for three months now. I still use all my normal face and skin creams but that is about the only aspect I have maintained. Next week I have to talk at an online conference. I am going to put some temporary dye in my hair, put on a dress and lippy and try to spruce myself up a bit. I am quiet looking forward to that although it will feel a bit strange, too. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this?  Have Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian My sleep has been the opposite of insomnia, it has been excessive. I am on medication for depression and this has always had a soporific effect and whenever I get anxious, my body and mind start to shut down after a while and I curl up and sleep for hours. This has been happening a great deal during lockdown – I have often slept during the afternoon, and also still slept well at night. I am struggling to stay awake. I wonder if this is also partly due to the lack of air and being in the flat so much, and getting up early for social distanced walks (I go out at 6am). I have not been having nightmares but have had very vivid dreams, but this is not unusual and is, again I think, triggered somewhat by my medication. I have to admit that often sleeping is the one thing I most look forward to in a day. It is a safety valve. The person I live with also has not had any change in his sleeping patterns. His ill health also means he sleeps a great deal during the day. He tends to nod off on the settee around 3pm each day, whilst listening to the radio. He sleeps very well at night, too. We both love sleep."

I have been mostly confined to the house since 23rd March, when I was placed on furlough from work. I have asthma and so have taken all the necessary precautions, such as hand washing, using anti-bacterial hand gel, keeping a two metre gap between myself and other people, and so on. Occasionally I wear latex gloves and a mask in shops, but I find that I touch my face more when wearing a mask. I feel that I'm doing all I can to avoid infection and infecting others. I had to go to the doctor's for my B12 injection this week. I have them every three months and I wasn't sure that the GP's surgery would be open, but I got an appointment straight away. The nurse said that they are trying to keep such services going, rather than having a huge surge of patients when lockdown is lifted. I was requested to wear a face mask if I had one and the nurse was also wearing one. My teenage daughter is finding lockdown far more difficult than I am. She really misses her friends. I'm quite introverted and not very sociable and so it is actually improving my mental health to be at home. I feel far more relaxed and less anxious. I occasionally feel overwhelmed by news from the outside world and so I don't dwell on it. The Government I think that the government response to the Covid-19 has been negligent. Weeks before lockdown, we did risk assessments at work and introduced cleaning routines and precautions: this is without being told to by the government. While the Prime Minister was still telling us that washing our hands was enough to stop the spread; that he had been shaking hands with hospital patients and that we were to 'take it on the chin,' people started taking precautions themselves. I know someone whose family live in Slovakia and they acted far more quickly -they took it very seriously as early as February and have had fewer cases as a result. The government response was late and badly managed. There was no quarantine procedure and people weren't being checked as they arrived at airports from abroad. When I flew to Hong Kong during the 1990s, during an outbreak of bird flu, everyone had their temperature taken as they disembarked the plane. This should have been introduced here as soon as we became aware of Covid-19 in Wuhan. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells In February, my daughter's classmate came back from a skiing trip in Italy with flu-like symptoms and a cough. She wasn't quarantined and it spread all round the class. I'm sure this happened up and down the country, as people returned from skiing holidays in France, Austria and Italy, where there were known outbreaks of Covid-19. The current government message to be 'alert' is confusing and meaningless. How can you be alert to an invisible virus? There are confusing and contradictory messages coming from the Government and the media is also making things much worse by scaremongering and causing panic. It is a time when strong leadership is needed, but we don't have it. News I watched the first Prime Ministerial address to the nation on 23rd March and I watched his recent address about the loosening of lockdown. I don't watch the daily briefings. I read newspapers online; mostly The Guardian, but other newspapers too, if they're not behind a paywall. I buy a Weekend Guardian on Saturday. I keep track of news on Twitter, but I notice that they are less up-to-date now -there was a time when Twitter had lots of breaking news, but it seems less on top of things now. I don't have a television and don't watch TV news. I don't think 24 hour rolling news is good for my mental health and I have taken the deliberate decision not to fixate on the news. I have seen the panic caused by the media, for example the early stockpiling which lead to food shortages in March. The tabloids should be more circumspect, rather than using shock tactics for clickbait. With regards to the BSL campaign -of course, it is vital that sign language is available. No one should be excluded from receiving important news updates. Work and Home Life The last day I went to work was 23rd March 2020. It was quite stressful, as we were cleaning our office three times a day and our boss had developed a cough and was working from home. There were lots of rumours about lockdown and it was making people anxious. I wasn't sure about my financial situation and was worried about that. When I got home from work, I had an email from the Directors at work, saying that I had been placed on Furlough. My line manager phoned later that day, to see if I had any questions. You aren't legally allowed to work on the Furlough scheme, so I haven't been to work since. It isn't possible for me to work from home -my work involves huge amounts of paperwork and it isn't digitised. We have physical invoices and delivery notes to process. I think that it shows that my company needs to update procedures and modernise, as Covid­19 may never go away and working from home may become a necessity. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells My fifteen-year-old daughter has school work to do on the computer. Fortunately her school provided her with a laptop earlier in the year, through a bursary for under-privileged children. She finds it very difficult to motivate herself at home and some days I know she isn't doing anything, although she pretends that she is! I have spoken to school and they are sympathetic, they understand that it is a huge thing to adjust to. I have concentrated on making art, while I'm stuck in the house. I try to draw, paint or collage every day. I haven't been able to read much, so I can sympathise with my daughter -there's something about lockdown which makes it difficult to concentrate. I find my mind wanders too much. It's as though we are waiting for something to happen. Some days we don't go for our daily exercise, although I know we should. My daughter finds 'social distancing' stressful and there are always people in the park. I have been interested to discover how much commerce motivates me to leave the house -normally I would go for a walk around the shops, but I can't do that now. The park is lovely, but it gets boring going there day after day. Technology I check my phone occasionally, but I'm not that bothered about technology. I like Instagram, mildly dislike Twitter and loathe Facebook. I'm very old fashioned and even before lockdown I had lots of pen pals, so I actually write letters more than I text or email people. I wouldn't dream of FaceTiming someone -I think it's awful. For my daughter, on the other hand, technology has been a lifeline. She had her fifteenth birthday in lockdown and she and her friends did a big Zoom party. Recently she organised a 90s rave via Facetime for her friend's birthday -they dressed up and danced, while talking to each other on their phones. She also had a Biology tutorial via video conference, with her teacher and some classmates. Shopping A couple of weeks before lockdown I managed to organise an online shop and bought extra tinned food, loo rolls and a 3kg bag of pasta. I have no money, so it wasn't exactly stockpiling. Since then, I haven't been able to get a delivery slot. They are booked up weeks ahead. I don't drive, so I had always got my shopping delivered, but I understand that the elderly and those who are 'shielding' need it more. My ex-husband's wife is very kind and asks if I need anything when she goes to Sainsburys. I go to M&S, perhaps once a week. It is more expensive, but it's far less stressful -it's so organised and clean and everyone is good at social distancing. There are now empty fridges in store, but I'm not sure if this is a supply chain problem or a response to fewer customers. I have also started getting a veg box delivered -this is through a wholesaler who has needed to diversify due to restaurant closures. I am happy to support a local business in this difficult time. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells Entertainment and Leisure I have loved having all this free time for my hobbies, but I'm not doing the things that I imagined I would at the start of lockdown. As I'm an avid reader and write short stories, I thought that I would be reading lots of books and writing more. However, apart from my daily diary, I haven't felt any desire to write at all. I also can't concentrate on reading and have read fewer books than I would normally. I have finished reading: Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World, by Laura Spinney Empty World, by John Christopher A Bit of a Stretch -The Diaries of a Prisoner, by Chris Atkins The Wall Jumper, by Peter Schneider The Children of Men, by P D James Mostly I have been making art. I have been carving rubber stamps, drawing, painting and making collages. I have also tried drawing with inks, which I enjoy. Painting is a new medium for me and I'm not very confident or skilful at it. I have enjoyed watching Grayson Perry's Art Club on Channel 4 for inspiration. My daughter enjoys watching TV with me at the end of the day, but, as I said, we don't watch terrestrial television. We watch Task Master on UKTV Play before bed, as it makes us laugh -I feel it's important to go to sleep feeling happy and not worried. We occasionally watch Rick and Morty, The Mighty Boosh and Toast on Netflix, but we have exhausted them from repeat viewing. As they are doing a 30-day free trial, we subscribed to Britbox UK and I have been watching Shetland on my own and Nathan Barley and Broadchurch with my daughter. I have also tried to introduce my daughter to some classic films on DVD. We have watched Black Narcissus together, plus some Lotte Reineger animations and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1970s version). We watched the latest version of Emma on Amazon Prime as a birthday treat for my daughter. I wish I had felt motivated to exercise more during lockdown, but I have low level anxiety about going outside. Unfortunately, we don't have a proper garden you could sit in. We have mostly stayed indoors. Personal Hygiene I guess it's different when you know that no one is going come within sniffing distance of you, so I would say that I am less bothered about showering every day. I would never go to work without having a shower first, but sometimes I will skip a day now. Never more than this -I would feel disgusting if I didn't wash my hair for a few days. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells I have noticed a meme on social media about women not shaving their legs on lockdown. have shaved my legs only twice on lockdown, but that is mainly because I'm avoiding non­essential shopping and haven't been anywhere to buy razors. I really, really miss buying nice bath bombs and cosmetics as a treat. Lush will be one of the first shops I go to when they reopen. I've been brushing my teeth more diligently, as the dentists are all shut and I don't want any dental problems. I have a semi-erupted wisdom tooth which sometimes gets infected and I want to avoid this very painful experience on lockdown. Sleep I have had some periods of insomnia, but no more than usual. I sleep badly any way. I get very hot at night and sleep with the window open, so any sound in the street will disturb me. I never remember dreams, but I had a really funny one at the beginning of lockdown. I dreamed that I went on a blind date with the Health Minister, Matt Hancock. He was a good dancer. I have no attraction to him in real life -it was definitely not an erotic dream! My sleep pattern is more like a weekend than a working day now. I usually get up for work at 6.30am. I find that I'm waking up around then, without setting an alarm, but having a lie-in for an hour or two. This is what I would normally do on Saturday and Sunday. In conclusion I have enjoyed being home and it has made me appreciate ordinary things more. I was feeling sick of Tunbridge Wells before lockdown, but now I really appreciate living in such a safe and picturesque town.  There is a lot of community spirit in the town and people have set up Facebook groups to support the vulnerable. On a personal level, it has made me appreciate my relationship with my daughter, but has also made me realise how much happier I would be if I had a creative job. While my experience is so far positive, I know that there are people struggling and suffering at the moment and I look forward to a return to normality for everyone’s sake."

Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covid19 (Update) I am writing this on Monday 18th May. Health In January 2020 I underwent breast cancer surgery and was waiting for chemotherapy to start. As the Covid situation worsened my husband was very concerned about me starting chemotherapy and wanted me to delay it until the virus passed. The consultant and I wanted to start the chemotherapy. The date for my first treatment was set for Tuesday 17th March. On the previous Sunday evening (15th) our son (B, 21) phoned to ask if he could come home from university as he was worried about a flatmate that was ill and generally concerned about the virus. We suggested he contact his tutors and decide definitely the next weekend. On Monday 16th he sent a message to say he was coming home on Tuesday 17th. On the same day (16th) our daughter (H, 24) who was working in Banff, Canada was asked to let her employers know on Weds 18th whether she intended to stay in Canada or leave as the ski resorts had shut and bars, pubs, nightclubs were shutting. She decided to come home and arrived on March 25th – my birthday and quarantined in her room for 2 weeks before joining in with family activities. Lockdown started here Monday 23rd March. I had my chemo treatment as planned and took myself for a little walk most days away from town centre keeping a good distance from other people. We are lucky that we live on a lane at the edge of town near some fields/park, so it is relatively easy to maintain social distancing. My husband and I do not own a car and after speaking to the GP decided it was preferable to ask friends for a lift to hospital appointments. Previously I had taken a bus and was prepared to take a taxi home if I did not feel well, but the GP thought it better to go with a friend – preferably one who was also shielding. After a few weeks I received a letter from the government/NHS stating that I am classed as clinically extremely vulnerable advising me to stay indoors for 12 weeks and even shield from my family members if possible. Given that I travel in a car with someone every 3 weeks and spend time in a room with other patients/medical staff and have to go for blood tests every 3 weeks, I meet a lot of people already so staying indoors the rest of the time seemed a bit pointless. I continue to go for a short walk most days. Sometimes I have a met a friend for a chat at the garden gate or in the park. My husband, daughter and son go shopping so I do not go into confined spaces with lots of people. Lockdown was slightly lifted last week (11th May) and my son asked permission to meet a friend of his in the park and my daughter asked if she could meet a friend over the weekend. They both assured us that they would comply with social distancing. How kind – I meet many more people than they do. My physical issues are being superbly dealt with by the hospital and GP surgery which has instigated a special blood test surgery with appointments every 15 minutes and a one way system through the building. Most of my appointments with the consultant have moved to be a telephone call every 3 weeks rather than in person. At the day unit where I receive chemotherapy the number of patients has been reduced and the chairs are further apart. I think the care has been very good. Mentally I am having the best of times. My children have come home. They have brought companionship, fun, noise, distraction, lots of laundry and mess. If just my husband and I were stuck at home alone with chemotherapy and the virus it would be much more boring and harder to cope with. We have diversions and distractions. If I had had cancer 10 years ago I would be running the house – shopping, cooking, cleaning, supervising school work. If I had cancer 10 years in the future I would be older and the children might be settled in a different town with partners and maybe their own children. At this time I have chemotherapy treatment and sometimes feel a bit unwell and I do not have to do to anything as they are quite capable of looking after themselves. They also report that they feel quite settled in the lockdown and do not regret coming home. We are all able to keep in touch with friends through whatsapp and zoom, we have a garden and live in a rural part of town. I understand that we are very lucky and that other people in different situations may not be finding it so easy. Emotionally I feel relaxed and content in the current situation. I work in a primary school and the government wants schools to take more pupils back from 1st June – they are already open for the children of key workers. I am glad that I am off work and not having to think about organising activities for young children that incorporate social distancing. I am worried that my children’s future is uncertain. Will my son return to Nottingham for university lessons or will they be online? Will he have to pay rent for a room he is not using? How will he collect the things that are still sitting in his room in Nottingham? My daughter planned to move to Bristol in August with a friend, get a job and study for a part time MSc. What will her chances be of getting a job – even a low paid hospitality/retail job. She would like to learn to drive but driving schools are not yet up and running. Will she be able to get a job working for an environmental charity when those jobs are already few and far between? The Government Initially I thought the government responded quite well offering the furlough scheme to workers laid off. I think maybe they should have locked down earlier – you could see that all the other European countries were locking down and the deaths were alarming in Spain France and Italy even in March. They are in an impossible situation – having to respond to something they did not have a plan for. Each decision seems to be taken as a reaction to something that has happened rather than taken as an overall strategy. They are asking people to go back to work, but not to use public transport, so the roads are becoming congested and air pollution will rise again. In London they are going to increase bike lanes. It would have been more sensible to have built the bike lanes before asking people to drive to work. News We do not watch the news on TV. We rarely buy a newspaper. My husband likes to listen to Radio4 news at 1o’clock. I have the BBC News app on my phone which I only recently installed. I read about the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm on the app. I receive enough information without it being too detailed. Work and home life As I mentioned above I usually work in a primary school but am off work because of my chemotherapy treatments. My husband works as a therapist so is seeing patients through Skype rather than face to face. My son usually works part time in a coffee shop but has been furloughed. My daughter does not have a job as she recently returned from Canada and has not been in a position to look for a new job. Home life is great as we are all together with no immediate worries. As the lockdown lifts and the children start to move back out into the real world then their career prospects might become more of a worry for them. At the moment we are living in a bubble. Technology I already knew how to Whatsapp video call people and have been using that to contact a few friends. A couple of other friends I phone without the visual element. My book group used Houseparty for one meeting and then used Zoom for the next one. We will stick with Zoom from now on as it seem more successful to use. I have not increased my use of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram much over this time. Shopping and food My husband, son and daughter take it in turns to go to Waitrose to get the shopping and carry it home. We can only buy what we can carry because we do not have a car. We have fruit and veg deliveredweekly througha box scheme anyway. We usually have toilet paper and tissues delivered from What the Crap company so the panic buying of those items has not been a problem for us. The local independent supermarket has started to do online deliveries so that has been useful. Obviously we need a lot more food now that the children have come home, but they have shared the burden of the shopping. My husband buys organic wholesome items. My son buys cake, biscuits, chocolate and sweets, oven chips and chicken nuggets. My daughter buys a sensible cross section of items. So the day my son goes shopping is always the more exciting. I am definitely putting on weight as I eat my way through the biscuits/cakes/desserts. This is partly because I am trying to find ways to counteract the horrible taste left by chemotherapy and partly because I do like chocolate and I am not walking distances anything like I usually do. Entertainment and Leisure I start my day reading a factual book whilst eating breakfast. After I am dressed I spend a bit of time working on a jigsaw puzzle – a new lockdown pastime. I always practise piano in the day. I have completed 2 courses from Future Learn – A History of Royal Fashion and Jane Austen: Myth, Reality and Global Celebrity. I have done some of these before. I started to work through a Latin course in March but have not done so much on that lately. I edit the magazine for the local U3A group and that has taken up more time recently as the next edition is about to be published. I knit for a charity Knit for Peace and have recently finished a jumper for a 10 year old boy and have just started something similar for a girl. I enjoy reading and have recently downloaded 50 classic stories onto my kindle so that I always have something available to read. My daughter and I have been watching Grayson Perry Art club TV programme so have been inspired to get arty. (A new pastime). I have bought some watercolour paints, pens and quality art paper. I have also ordered some mosaic pieces as we plan to decorate mirrors in the next few weeks. My son and husband have been inspired to join in a bit as well. As a family we have been playing board games some evenings. I do not watch that much TV especially at the moment. My son wants to use the playstation attached to the TV to play games with his friends in the evening and I think it is more important for him to have some social interaction than for me to watch TV. My husband, daughter and I are watching The Nest – rather creepy series about a couple who have asked a young woman to have a surrogate baby for them. My daughter and I watched Hidden Figures film recently about African American women working for NASA. We also watched a chick flit film with Rebel Wilson. Personal hygiene I have the same number of showers/baths per week but I no longer wash my hair as so much has fallen out due to chemotherapy that I do not want to wash away the last remaining strands! I wear the same clothes for 2 or even 3 days now to reduce washing and since I rarely see anyone no one will know. I do so little exercise that I don’t believe I am sweaty or smelly. Sleep I sleep just fine thank you possibly because the chemotherapy makes me very tired, possibly because I am quite relaxed. I think the rest of the family are also sleeping as usually. My daughter and son have had vivid dreams in the past and occasionally have some now. I heard my daughter call out in her sleep just last night and apparently she dreamt someone was in her room. She can be quite noisy when sleeping."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Neither my partner nor myself have been unwell over the last ten weeks. Bad hay fever this year might have caused us on occasion to think that we had covid 19 symptoms but you just have to try and stay calm and ask whether this is really any different to normal. The changing advice on symptoms also makes it difficult to know quite what to look out for. For instance, in the last couple of weeks there has been reference to loss of taste – with blocked sinuses from hay fever poor sense of taste is also something I’ve experienced. I think ultimately as an asthmatic I tend to know when I don’t feel quite right, so I have to think that this judgement is sufficient even at the moment. I think at the start we were particularly on the lookout for a high temperature and unusual headache. I would say there was a heightened anxiety for both of us at the start of the “lockdown” period and also leading up to the imposed restrictions, not concerning ourselves but primarily about how we would be able to support both sets of elderly parents, late 80’s, at a distance of 70 miles. Whilst this is still a constant concern, a pattern of ordering food, keeping contact etc has now been established. Initially though these concerns are what caused the greatest anxiety for us both resulting in fatigue, poor sleep, strange dreams and short tempers! I suffer from migraine which ordinarily would have been better controlled with an imposed routine with regular meals, hours and not going far from home, but I experienced a cluster of migraines which it was difficult to shift especially as my sleep was so disrupted. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I’ve had no need to access health care, but I was due to attend a hospital appointment for post surgery physio. This took place over the phone and I was then sent videos of exercises. Because I’d previously had appointments and have seen significant improvement in strength and movement, this was more than acceptable, but I think I would have felt differently earlier in the process where it was critical for a physical examination to assess my needs. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I would say that my emotions feel quite “normal” for me now. At the start of the shutdown though I felt more unsettled. Listening to news items on the radio could cause me to become tearful. Now I feel that my response is of being deeply moved, and then angry that so much of what has gone wrong could have been prevented, for instance if the health service had not been cut to the bare bones. Ordinarily I’m involved in local politics and we would have been out campaigning for the now postponed London GLA and mayoral elections. I’m frustrated that at a local level we don’t have a way of challenging the nationally defined and politically charged messages. Locally there has been a campaign to save out local hospital, and I wonder whether the clap for carers will be transformed into the local electorate realising they have to fight to maintain our service. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? The government continues to say it is guided by the science, but this is meaningless and nonsense. On the face of it, the decisions made appear to contradict the ideology of the current government, especially the economic decisions. Ultimately though the government had to induce a recession to ensure that thee was so little activity that people, if not technically in total lockdown(as was experienced in Italy for instance) believed that they were, in order to curtail people’s activities and thus prevent the infection getting out of control. In the last week the government is now trying to kickstart the economy again. Some people seem willing to go along with this -some because they have no choice to maintain their livelihood, others because they just want to go out. I fear that some think that because they’ve stayed at home that they won’t catch the virus now, and so their resolve to continue social distance has diminished, so potentially the decision to ease lockdown could result in another spike. Perhaps this is deliberate, as politicians such as Iain Duncan Smith show their callousness and brutality when interviewed. He is categorical that there is no choice but to return to work, and he seems to suggest this regardless of the consequent number of lives lost. One decision that was clearly politically motivated was that relating to the funding of Transport for London(Tfl). Numbers using the tube have dropped by (?) 90%, so successful with regard to social distancing and ensuring that key workers can get to work safely, however the resulting loss in revenue has meant that the Labour London Mayor had to seek a £1.6 billion bailout package and the associated conditions will be politically damaging(the mayoral and GLA elections have been postponed a year to May 2021). He will be required to put restrictions on free travel for the over 60’s, increase fares and possibly remove free travel for children. Transport is one of a few areas where the mayor can make decisions for London and this has been taken away from him in a politically way as other European cities have subsidised public transport. A major scandal has been the way in which the government has shown a disregard for the lives of the elderly and the vulnerable. Even before there were any restrictions on daily activity, the public was told that Covid 19 was like a seasonal flu and that anyway it was only the elderly and those with underlying health conditions at risk. The message was that these lives were dispensable and many who fall into these categories were given the implicit message that valuable ventilators would not be used to attempt to save their lives. These groups have been left in a no win situation – those in care homes are still struggling to obtain tests, as are staff, and whilst residents were starting to die in outbreaks in homes, the government continued to say that there wasn’t a problem. People were discharged from hospital to care homes without being tested and consequently were still covid positive and returned still capable of transmitting the virus. The lack of availability of suitable personal protective equipment(PPE) continues, showing scant regard for the lives of workers. Care homes have had to pay inflated prices as the government does not supply them directly. Carers have been unable to get tested, with many so worried about residents and their own families that they have moved into the care homes. There is now evidence that those of BME heritage are at increased risk from the virus and despite this being evident in the disproportionate number of deaths of non-white health and care workers, the government merely announces this as a “risk factor”, with no suggestion as to how BME workers will be protected. Increasingly statistics are rolled out and statements made which fail to show even a pretence of compassion. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Despite what is currently being said, I think that there is likely to be a return to some form of “austerity”. Although it makes no economic sense to think that the debt which is building from, for instance furlough payments, should be paid off, particularly as current low interest rates mean that servicing the debt is low, the Tories will struggle to stop themselves saying that the country can’t afford it. It’s likely that labour laws will be relaxed further and the rights of workers further eroded; possibly the minimum wage will be frozen. However there is a distinct possibility of an L-shaped recession, so if the economy is going to do more than bounce along the floor, the government will have to make decisions about how they can increase aggregate demand. Politically it would be damaging to increase direct taxes for those already in the upper income tax bracket, but if they choose to increase regressive indirect taxes then inequality will worsen. To limit benefits for the unemployed and the low paid will deepen and prolong the recession, but unfortunately I don’t trust this government not to do this. They might consider a hypothecated tax, from income tax or more likely national insurance, but in reality any of these measures will merely give the illusion that they are attempting to “bring the deficit down”. There have been numerous comparisons with the 2008 crash. This morning I heard George Osborne interviewed and he made statements such as “the country will be poorer” suggesting that we are yet again being prepared for significant public sector service cuts, benefit freezes and stricter eligibility criteria for benefits, as the government will want to quickly withdraw from the government ownership, payment of wages and nationalisation that has taken place. They will argue that state control will stifle enterprise, that the country can’s afford the debt etc etc. The sectors now centrally organised will be returned to the private sector in the guise of dealing with the debt, when in reality hedge funds and financiers will be given the chance to purchase equity at significantly reduced prices. Unfortunately, rather than saying this is a global downturn, the government will go out of its way to hold its ideological ground and “bribe” (for instance with further deregulation of the labour market) those already with wealth and resources at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly. The project to conclude the privatisation of the NHS will be hastened, as we are told that it is unsustainable to run at a “loss” a hospital/GP practice/community services/ social care etc. The Thursday “clap” for carers is a useful distraction to mark the passing of another week and stops serious questioning about the underfunding and privatisation of the service which has resulted in health, care and other workers dying because they went to work and were not given the correct equipment, facilities or testing which might have saved their lives. This week the government, after much pressure from its own back benchers, to allow those workers in health and care who are defined as “migrants”, to access health care without paying the surcharge. Not only have the logistics yet to be arranged, but the surcharge is to be increased to over £600 a month in October, and sadly I suspect those workers will then be told they have to pay the charge yet again. Footnote: this weekend the story has broken about Dominic Cummings breaking the lockdown in April to travel with his family from London to his parental home in Durham. With announcements due this week about possible relaxation in rules the media and government have become preoccupied with this story. My main concern is how this will now affect guidelines in the coming weeks. People are angry, upset and showing a loss of confidence in the “leadership”, and there’s much talk of “one rule for us, and one for them”. Generally people will comply with restrictions on their lives if they perceive they are not being singled out and victimised, and this story completely destroys this tenuous bond of trust. A sense of equity has been, and is, pivotal to such a high adherence to the “lockdown” measures News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I tend to listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 for a couple of hours from its start at 6am to catch up on any developments from the previous day and for international news especially anything that has broken in the US. I briefly read the Guardian online, but not every morning and then the next regular source is the Channel 4 news in the evening. Occasionally I’ll catch the 10 o’clock news and/or Newsnight, but won’t stick with either it feels like mere repetition, or just too much of a platform for the government’s message. I made the decision very early not to keep track of rolling news as it could have been too overwhelming. I’m also concerned about being led to believe something because it fits with the message of the day, particularly by the use of photos, so I prefer to let the news “mature” and allow myself time to reflect. I’m aware that this is at odds with rolling news and constant drip feeds and chitter chatter from social media. I’m especially impressed by the reports that Victoria Mcdonald presents on Channel 4. I will sometimes dip into twitter to see but I don’t tweet. I have no alerts on my phone so am not constantly scrolling. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I watched them in the first week, and now sometimes dip into a live audio broadcast. If there is a specific set of policies that are to be announced then I’m more likely to listen, specifically if the chancellor is speaking. On the whole they appear to be a front for the message of the day, and by having a member of the cabinet standing between “2 scientists” there’s an attempt at creating an (unconvincing) illusion of science guided policy which is beyond politics. The broadcasts have become less palatable to watch as it is so clear when the front politician is lying. So many mistakes have been made and so many deadlines missed that it is astounding that they continue to sound so emphatic. Questions are on the whole inadequately answered and when pushed if something will take place(for instance testing in care homes) the words used are carefully chosen – “an aspiration” or “tests are available” Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? This has not touched me personally, but I remember mentioning to my partner that in one news bulletin Bolsanaro had someone signing, and wondering why the UK government didn’t especially as the Welsh and Scottish briefings do have interpreters. The response from the UK government a couple of weeks ago was that they were looking into this(what was there to look into?) but nothing has changed, which is unacceptable and says something truly disturbing and yet unsurprising about the attitude of those in charge. Accessibility is still seen a luxury which is an insult to all those affected. The lack of BSL signers is unfortunately just one example of the problems many are experiencing– ASD, those with mental health issues, those with learning difficulties, the visually impaired, elderly carers and so on. Information was also not circulated in braille, and I know from local media that a couple who are visually impaired didn’t know what they should do as they had not seen the government’s advice, and consequently one of them died as he didn’t get to hospital on time. The elderly mother of a friend has had some problems specifically at the start. She is severely visually impaired, lives on her own, and is in her 90’s. He has been arranging Sainsbury’s deliveries for her for several years mow but he was suddenly unable to do so as she isn’t considered vulnerable according to government criteria. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I’m not in paid employment so I’ve no immediate direct personal experience of this. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My partner and I are very fortunate as neither of us is in paid employment and we have no school aged children. We are fortunate to have a garden and 2 separate downstairs rooms so we are able to escape from eachother if we need to! Pre pandemic we chose to spend our days together so we haven’t been forced into an unfamiliar situation. We have many shared interests and with the benefit of the internet it’s possible to pursue these ad infinitum. Having said that, we are also both self sufficient and equally happy to spend time apart even if the distance is only by being in separate rooms. Usually we spend a lot of time exploring and doing things in London, getting around by public transport and on foot. We still walk a lot, but the focus is on exercise rather than exploring, although in the last week we’ve researched and explored a couple of local (hidden and unmarked) archeological sites. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? This hasn’t arisen, I suspect primarily because there has been no driving force from the workplace which previous experience suggests is where the impetus tends to come from eg my introduction to email many years ago was at work where I used it before using it at home. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? Keeping in touch regularly has been with family, and friends without work commitments. I’ve not used any new methods to keep contact(and would not use Zoom anyway) tending to stick with the method that I’ve always used with different people. It has made me realise that I do keep in touch with different people in different ways – phone, text/sms, email and WhatsApp. We have a WhatsApp group of 4 close family members, and then I only use it for 2 of my closest friends – curiously one who lives very close by, and another who moved away from the UK a couple of years ago. If so, what has this been like? It’s made me realise that I use WhatsApp for a chat with people I’m close to. I also like the ability to share, especially photos, with ease. I don’t post on any platforms, although I lurk, as I don’t feel the need to be “out there” and so WhattsApp provides a more managed intimate way of keeping contact, mainly because of who I communicate with rather than the nature of the App. I’ve always felt that WhattsApp groups which to date I’ve resisted joining can be intrusive and overwhelming. Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I checked in on a few people at the start – friends who by the nature of friendship and how it changes over time are people I care about and have known a long time, but our paths cross infrequently. To keep more regular contact now seems an intrusion and would change the dynamic – one friend has returned to healthcare and although I think of him we don’t ordinarily communicate frequently. We had a text conversation when it was announced that retired GPs were being “invited” to return, but since then I’ve held back from getting in touch again as I don’t want him to feel he needs to keep “checking in”. It can be a challenge sometimes just making such regular contact with elderly parents especially when no one has done anything and remaining sympathetic to their situation. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I don’t post on any and am not a FB lurker. I will however, a I always have done, lurk on Twitter looking at the accounts of people who I’ve always dipped into to find different sources of information and reading via links. I have started reading a countrywide community forum as escapism – nothing quite beats spending 10 minutes whilst the pasta is cooking reading a thread called “what’s for tea tonight?”. I’ve always been fascinated by people who prodigiously post anywhere, especially when they start to reveal things about themselves – just as I’m doing here! Perhaps we all need to express ourselves somewhere where we feel comfortable and I like the fact I have a MOA number not a name! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I’ve not been into a shop since lockdown, and although I did occasionally think about popping out to get something, such thoughts are occurring less and less. I started online shopping about 15 years ago, and although I do it less frequently now it wasn’t a huge change for me to arrange this to enable a degree of self isolation. However getting delivery slots for the first few weeks was a challenge and almost became a full time job, at least a preoccupation(and the fuel for a dream/nightmare), especially trying to arrange deliveries for elderly parents and in laws who don’t shop online. We now have a good routine of weekly fruit and veg boxes and a supermarket delivery every couple of weeks, so that I can also order food for a couple of people who are self isolating. I’ve used a breadmaker anyway for 15 years or so, so made sure I had plenty of flour. I’m using the breadmaker more to make dough and then shape prove and bake and cook in the oven because I’m around to do so. It’s enjoyable, the bread is tasty and I’m trying different types. We’re here everyday so dinner is at home and always cooked from scratch. We normallykeep easy food eg a ready meal/pizza, in the freezer for when we go out for the day, or for a quick meal before an evening meeting, but we don’t need to now. I’m cooking a greater variety of meals and looking at recipes – I’ve got the time and I don’t want to waste any food especially from the fruit and veg boxes. I would also say I’m taking more care storing food and keeping the windowsill herbs alive! Because of a shortage of yeast sourdough had its moment which I indulged in. Although the results have been delicious I’m not baking it regularly. I put a starter into hibernation in the freezer a month or so a go and retrieved it yesterday and started feeding it again, so maybe another loaf in a week or so. It seems to be waking up!! Initially the first supermarket delivery was for 4 households which we then delivered – quite an organisational feat. I’ve a couple of friends who can get slots now, and we all check-in with eachother when we have a slot and order items for eachother. My son has worked throughout as a key worker and so I’ve organised deliveries to go there(50 miles away) He is a carer as well so it just didn’t seem right that he should work and then have to queue at the supermarket – the shopping trips having to be frequent as he has no car. Afterthought 28 May 2020 I’m starting to think that the feelings that I had about being thrust into the role of domestic manager are more than just niggles. We’re already seeing that it’s women in the workplace who are more likely to be made redundant but there are signs that there is an increasing burden on women for effective household management. I’ve been considering conversations that I’ve had with friends, all women in conventional stable opposite sex marriages or partnerships. These women are in their 20’s, 40’s, 50’s, 70’s and 80’s. All but the youngest are mothers, and whilst being(or have been) in what would bee considered “professional” jobs, have tended to move more frequently between workplaces and with various mixes of part and full time paid work. Even with adult children it seems that mothers are providing support in for instance getting food. I think the initial shortages and the desire not to enter shops meant we were all furiously organising and planning. It seems to becoming a burden, but maybe it’s just that we’re stuck at home with no escape from partners? There was also a lot of early lockdown house cleaning and tidying by people generally. I woildn’t say that my friends are particularly houses proud, but because this is also linked with hand washing, disinfecting and trying to ensure surfaces are virus free this also seems to be something that’s managed by women. Including ensuring that sufficient cleaning products are in the house. I’m certainly wiping surfaces more frequently than usual(maybe because I’m here) and cleaning the bathroom everyday. It’s drudge so why am I doing it? I need to think more about this and see how it plays out, but I’m getting a sense that women are certainly dealing with increased drudgery, and also that fatal combination of responsibility and some bitterness. A friend said she’d had a “robust conversation” with her husband when we were discussing that “the men” seem to dip into cooking when it suits and don’t take into account that it’s one meal of many in the week when choosing ingredients. Also the default is that we will cook. I’ve much more to say on this but maybe I need to reflect first! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? There was a great flurry at the start of lockdown with people proselytizing about all the life changing achievements we were going to make. I was very sceptical from the start and it seemed it was just a way to generate copy for “lifestyle” pages and gave an opportunity for endless youtube videos. It seemed like some people just couldn’t cope without being governed by the language of scientific management and the need for targets. I also keep thinking that many of these so called projects are merely ways of encouraging people to continue to spend money. We’ve done some sorting and tidying of things that have been niggling for a while, and found cobwebs which normally I wouldn’t bother seeing. The list of thing that we could do around the house has not greatly shortened, but given a free choice I would prefer to read or bake. We walk at least 3 – 4 miles everyday, which is not unusual, and further on other days. I can only think of a handful of days since the restrictions when we’ve not gone for a walk. With the roads so much quieter it’s also felt safer to cycle, which is something that we only normally do when on holiday. I usually swim, but haven’t done so this winter because of surgery, so that wasn’t too much of a shock, although now the weather is nice I do most days think about the joys of sea swimming, which is very important to me over the summer months when we go away for extended periods in our campervan. Oh, and I suppose there’s all the dancing in the kitchen to the music turned up loud whilst cooking and baking. I’ve also been able to be very conscientious about my post operative physio and turned it into a 40 minute workout every other day, with 15 minutes of stretches on alternate days. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I always have a book on the go anyway, but tend to read shorter books so they’re easily thrown into my rucksack, and not too heavy! When the weather has been nice, and as we’re not going out, I’m reading more than usual in the garden(a bit like being on holiday), so I’ve just finished Thomas Mann’s “Buddenbrooks”. It is a hardback, long and heavy, so I’ve been waiting to take it on holiday, but now it will be one of my reading memories of the sunny lockdown spring. I have got more time to read and I think my head must be less cluttered as usual I’m tending to have fiction and non­fiction on the go at the same time, yet m also feel less hurried reading and able to think more deeply about the non fiction whilst still immersing myself in the world that I’m living in through the novels. I’ve watched the first 2 series of “The Wire”, rationed not binged(!), and I’m looking forward to the next one, again not something I would normally commit to. Apart from the news I’ve watched little TV but that’s not unusual. In the early weeks when the evenings were still getting dark earlier, “Bakeoff” and similar light programmes might be on in the background whilst I read the paper online. We usually go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema and also attend public lectures, so at the start thee was an element of “we should have been going to….”. I’ve perhaps listened to more podcasts as a result and we’ve watched a couple of plays online, but neither are substitutes for shared, live events. Podcasts are just different but familiar anyway, whereas I do struggle with watching a play on a small domestic screen, and it’s made me realise how you make your own experience of a play by where you choose to look, whereas the camera does that for you with a broadcast. The result is it takes me much longer to get involved and I’m not convinced I can suspend my disbelief as easily, but having said that, after an initial non plussed 30 minutes, the performance of “A Streetcar named Desire” that we watched last night was totally absorbing. I listen to a variety of podcasts depending on my mood and time from the lightweight (e.g. Fortunately) to the more informative (e.g. Talking Politics, with David Runciman). I can’t abide radio phone ins! The only music radio we have on is Radio 6, as usual, but more of it as I’m at home more and it also provides an automatic disco to dance to whilst cooking. Music is also something my partner and I share – discussing and listening, and hunting out youtube clips. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? The most obvious change is the focus on hand-washing – both frequency and duration – and the resulting need for hand cream. When the weather was still cold I did have an eczema flare up on my hands which was really the only time that hand-washing was painful, and I suppose normally I would have avoided putting my hands in water so frequently. There’s been no significant change, although I’ve noticed that not going on public transport means that clothes don’t get as dirty and there’s not the griminess on the skin which happens when travelling on the tube. The main impact for me, as for everyone, is the inability to get my hair cut. I’d had an appointment booked for March 23, so I’ve not had a cut since 10 Feb. I’m not at all worried about my appearance, but as someone with very thick, short hair it’s uncomfortable in the warm weather, and it’s very obvious that I need a cut. Apart form daily exercise I don’t leave the house/garden I simply use hair grips to hold it back out of my eyes-not exactly flattering but hey The overriding anxiety at the thought of someone cutting my hair is a useful distraction when I wonder which way to try and push my heavy fringe – 4 July is being mooted as a possible date for hairdressers to open, but I won’t be first in the queue. It’s only just struck me that I’ve gone into winter mode for leg shaving – ie not at all! Need to think about that one. Perhaps as we’ve all become a bit more inward looking and isolated it shows just how much pressure there is to have smooth legs, and without social interaction it’s somet"

There have been a couple of times where we have worried that we might have symptoms of Covid19, such as my husband having a cough and one day where my son went back to bed with a temperature. My emotions have been very up and down throughout the lockdown period. At times I have felt a kind of contentment, a feeling of enjoying the lack of pressure to do things and be somewhere, a feeling of being safe and happy with my small unit. At other times I have found myself in tears over something seemingly trivial and overcome with frustration at the never-ending nature of this situation. The ‘homeschooling’ situation has been a big challenge for us all, with poor support and a lack of direction from the school, a child trying to make sense of it all and me desperately trying to make sure he doesn’t fall behind in his learning. There have been days where we have shouted at each other and both been in tears, with others where things have gone more smoothly and we feel satisfied with some small progress. Government I have felt angry and disappointed in our leaders. There has been indecision throughout, a lack of clarity over what is expected of us (especially as time has gone one), a withholding of supplies for care workers and a culture of blame as cases and deaths have increased. As we move on, it seems clear that industry is being prioritised over health and we are pretty much being told to take responsibility for ourselves. Boris Johnson really does seem though, to be self-congratulatory over how the pandemic has been handled. I worry that lockdown restrictions have been eased too quickly at a few points, with a strange priority being given to activities such as horse racing and professional football, where really, people would simply like to be able to see their friends and family. It looks as if lots of power will be handed over to local authorities, with they and individuals being expected to take responsibility for them/ourselves. News I have been accessing news mostly online, looking at the Guardian and BBC websites. I listen also to Radio 4 and watch the news on TV sometimes. I was watching the briefing every day at first and checking the news regularly, as things were moving quickly. I started to feel frustrated with the format of these briefings, with too much waffle and not enough clarity. I chose, instead, to summarise the facts for myself through the media listed above, focussing on what is important to me and trying to filter out other information to keep myself sane. Work and home life I have been working from home, kind of. My work couldn’t physically happen at first, so my employer (I work freelance, on a contract), cut my hours to two a week, with my wages being adjusted accordingly. This has changed slightly as time has gone on, with my hours increasing a little and my pay coming back up – the work is being carried out from home, in an admin capacity. My husband has been working from home since before lockdown, using our spare room, where he is constantly on video calls, working intensely and only appearing for meals. His hours were cut to three days a week for a while, but he is now back to five days. I mentioned above about homeschooling, which has been my responsibility. There has been tension at times, with frustrations building up and the lack of having ‘something to look forward to’. Technology I really dislike video calls. I find them stressful and uncomfortable. I have, of course, had to get over this and we have been having a weekly ‘family call’ with my husband’s family. This is nice at times, but I don’t always want to do it, finding it tiring and repetitive. We sometimes do a quiz with them, which lasts for hours and I can see is now wearing a bit thin. We would never normally see these people this much, so it can feel a bit forced at times. One positive thing is that my husband and I spent a few hours getting my mum signed up to WhatsApp so that she can do video calls with us. It was a real challenge, but we got there in the end and she was delighted to see us. On our son’s birthday, she and my dad did a video ‘party’, where they had made cakes, wore party hats and sang happy birthday. We also organised a surprise video party for our son and his friends. I do use Twitter and Facebook to keep up-to-date and to stay in touch with friends. Shopping and food As I have asthma, my husband offered to do the shopping. We had a few small deliveries at first, but it was so difficult to book these that he has been cycling to the supermarket once a week. He has worn a mask and taken a cloth to wipe down the trolley throughout. At times this has been very busy and stressful, but things seem a little less so now. I have recently been to local shops, to buy bread and it is nice to see other people and have a chat. We always cook from scratch anyway, so this isn’t a big change for us. For me, it is odd having my husband and son at home for lunch, so I tend to eat more than I would when I am on my own during the day (this has resulted in weight gain…). My husband has been making sourdough bread – he had done this previously, but is doing so more now. Entertainment and leisure I don’t think our entertainment and leisure have changed that much really, maybe we watch a little more TV in the evening. I usually read a lot, but have found it very difficult to focus on reading much. We sometimes rent a film to watch, as if we were going to the cinema and we have tuned in to the National Theatre Live events. In terms of fitness, we are normally an active family, so this has been challenging in many ways. I normally swim a lot, so have struggled with not being able to do this. We have walked most days as a family and I now get up early to walk by myself when it’s quieter (I find it stressful when the park/paths are busy). My son and I have joined in the PE with Joe Wickes sessions, completing every day until he reduced the sessions. We have a turbo trainer and my husband and I have put our bikes on here and used this (though we both find it really boring). Personal hygiene My hygiene habits haven’t changed. To have a sense of routine and normality, I was very strict with my son about getting dressed every day for ‘homeschool’. I think it is important and has helped our well-being to take care of our appearance. We have all had the huge hair growth, with my son cutting my husband’s hair a couple of times (we have both decided to go with the longer hair ourselves). I have actually enjoyed this, embracing the new look, which I think I will keep. Sleep My sleep has been very up and down. I have had bouts of sleeplessness and had one night where I had what was probably a panic attack – I had to get out of bed and was sobbing uncontrollably, I felt overwhelmed and took a while to calm down. I have had lots of weird dreams. Sometimes these are quite day-to-day, sometimes frightening (having a bird stuck in my hair, which died, climbing a very tall ladder that feel away from under me, swimming the English Channel…). My husband has also had sleep changes and odd dreams and our son sleep-walked the other night, which he has never done before."

She coughed and struggled with walking due to being short of breath pretty non-stop for a week. Then she had a stonking temperature. The cough lingered, less severely and less frequently, for at least a month afterwards. Obviously there were no Covid19 tests available at that point, so we’ll never be able to confirm that she had Covid, but as time goes on, there’s very little doubt left in my mind that she did. I suffered from tightness in my chest and headaches for a couple of days in the second week of our isolation, but my husband and 7­year-old son had no symptoms. We didn’t seek out any medical advice – we kept our daughter at home, administering paracetamol and lots of fluids (and hugs). Our emotions during lockdown have been all over the place. There’s some relief at not having to run around doing all the things we normally do, but there is similarly grief for those things. It’s hard all four of us in the house together, all day everyday, very little space and time to ourselves. It’s exhausting, and we miss our friends and being able to hug our grandparents/parents/siblings/cousins. The government I think the government have not handled the response to the pandemic as well as they could have (they should have shut the UK’s borders to tourists/business travellers as lockdown started). But then it’s a very long time since there’s been a pandemic within the UK’s countries and no government would have known how to get it right first time. I think we’ll be in and out of lockdowns until there’s a vaccine. It’ll be a miracle if Boris Johnson is still prime minister at the end of the year – but then again, no one else will want the job. News I mainly look at the BBC and Guardian websites for news updates. I’ve watched a couple of the government briefings, but they are long and to be honest depressing, and they don’t tell me anything that I can do to make things better. I think there should be a BSL interpreter for all government briefings, and all information and guidelines need to be available in other languages that are spoken in the UK. Work and home life I’m self-employed so have carried on working, though I had to back out of a couple of large projects that I wouldn’t have time for with the children home from school. Having two children at home has been really hard – they’re confused, demotivated and bored, and I’m not a natural teacher. My husband has been really busy with his work – his employer talks about the importance of mental health and quality family time, but then insists on meetings from 8am through to 6pm. We are trying to be kind to each other as much as we can, and I think we’re managing better than I expected! S6928 female, 42, married, Saffron Walden, copy-editor Technology Zoom calls with friends and family – and we’ve set up weekly calls for the children and some of their friends too. I can see the novelty is going to wear off soon enough… especially as me and my husband work on computers and the children do some of their school work on computers too. I’m on Facebook and that’s helped me connect with friends and family abroad. I’m also doing Zoom exercise classes with the fitness instructor whose classes I’ve been doing for seven years. That’s been fun, though it’s been odd having the kids sat on the sofa behind me as I do a Clubbercise class! We have done some Joe Wicks PE, but me and my husband are more enthusiastic than the kids, who are rarely out of their PJs by the time he comes on. Shopping and food I’d stockpiling some store cupboard items early in March in anticipation of some kind of lockdown. They lasted us for the two weeks of isolation that we had to do. A few friends dropped off fresh items for us too. It took a few weeks to be able to get supermarket deliveries, but we’re getting a slot once a week now which means we don’t have to go and queue. Entertainment and leisure Board games, watching documentaries with the kids, computer games – there’s not much time during the week for much once school work and work are done. We’ve cleaned and treated our decking, which has needed doing for a couple of years. And planted lots of flower seeds. Personal hygiene No change for me – working from home I’ve always showered once a day and I’ve kept that routine up. I suppose I’m a bit less likely to put product in my hair and style it. Sleep I’ve been sleeping like a log! Probably a reduction in the stress around dashing around getting the kids to various activities and having to deal with annoying parents on the school run. The children have been going to sleep later – they’re less tired because they’re getting less mental stimulation and physical exercise."

I live in a terraced house with my mother, father, and older sister. I am half Chinese (from mother’s side) and half British (father’s side). During term-time, I live in privately-rented student accommodation (flats often with 5/6 other students) in East London. Health: In the past few weeks since the outbreak, I haven’t much experienced much mental or physical health issues as I try to keep myself busy and active where possible – eg studying, researching for my dissertation, gardening, doing house chores, watching TV series, movies and dancing for exercise and entertainment. My family have been okay with coping with new situations and remote working, although now that we’re all always at home (apart from food shopping, exercise) we have slightly more disputes or mini-arguments. My parents have different levels of patience and tolerance so me and my older sister are always trying to keep an eye on them and avoid them having any major arguments. Overall, we have managed to adapt quite well to new arrangements despite the odd argument or disagreement over generally petty issues. The Government: I think the government are doing what they can for the best of the UK public, but better management of providing PPE and funds for the NHS and other critical services is required. I agree with the action the government is taking to not provide funds for struggling industries such as airlines (eg Richard Branson and Virgin Airways) as taking care of the population is far more important than funding an industry which is part of the blame in the vast global spread of the virus let alone its impact on air pollution and climate change. I think in the coming months the government will start to ease certain restrictions, but I am pessimistic of how long it will take for when people can stop working from home, go to more shops, go outside more often and travel. I hope something is done for those in need of haircuts and not trusting themselves to follow instructions from people online (!) I would be willing to pay more if it means hairdressers and customers are protected well. News: I have mainly been following developments in covid-19 from BBC News, The Guardian and international bodies like the CDC or WHO. Me and my family usually watch/listen to the daily government broadcast at 5pm, although sometimes these aren’t very informative as they (along with the media) spend much time on death statistics – which is important, but not as significant as what is being (or going to be) done to tackle the virus, limit its spread, care for those with lost loved ones, university students etc. I hope all government broadcasts have a British Sign Language Interpreter, and am surprised this is not already a requirement. 24/7 access to information regarding Covid-19 should be available for everyone. Work and home life: None of my family have been furloughed, although my mother (who is a free-lance self employed Mandarin Chinese-English interpreter) accepts far less jobs than usual. My father and sister are working from home and we’re are now used to it. But our internet isn’t the best, so cuts in connection are quite common, but not too much as to be affecting their daily working. After the lockdown, my father is very likely to be working from home more, my sister prefers at her company due to network and connection issues and its easier for her to study/work there. Technology: The impact of covid-19 hasn’t affected my use of technology too much, apartfrom havingto have online seminars/tutorials for my university course. I still use a similar amount of time on social media like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. My parents are now mostly used to using online meeting technology (like Microsoft Teams,Zoomand Skype) and use these regularly.I’ve always tried to use social media in moderation, and never use apps like SnapChat and Tik Tok as Idon’t want social media to consume my life and play a dominant role in shaping my opinions/worldviews. Misinformation and fake news are also a large deterrent! Shopping and food: We tend to have one big shop at a Tesco Superstore per week, whilst going to other grocers like the Co-operative, Waitrose, Sainsburys, corner shops etc for other foodstuffs. Working out what times are busiest is quite difficult, but we manage. My eating habits haven’t changed much since the outbreak, but I’m sure people suffering from eating disorders are facing their own issues. Entertainment and leisure: When I am not studying, researching my dissertation, learning Mandarin Chinese (with my mother) or doing online courses, I tend to play on my Xbox One – Monster Hunter World:Iceborne (very immersive, fun, slightly addicting) + Just Dance 2020 for exercise and personal interest in dance. I also watch various TV series/films: Harry Potter, Killing Eve, Grey’s Anatomy, Bones, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Doc Martin with my dad, Mr Bean, Marvel, DC, cartoons, and the news. I watch random videos on YouTube at least 3 times a day ranging from cute animal videos, music, clips from TV series/films, Xbox Game guides/tips/walkthroughs and reaction vids. I am listening to more music particularly relaxing/chill along with Lady Gaga, Bishop Briggs and Melanie Martinez. I’m also spending more time in our garden (small, but comfy and various bushes/plants and ponds for wildlife) watering plants, general maintenance and taking pictures/vids of wildlife like newts in our pond. Personal Hygiene: All of my family at home are being more conscious of our hygiene, we always wash our hands after handling post, after recycling/disposing of the packaging; always wash hands after coming back from shopping/daily exercise. We probably won’t stop our new habits for at least this year (next page continued) Sleep: My father has always suffered from insomnia, so despite the outbreak he still rarely gets more than 4-5 hours of sleep every day. My mother and sister sleep like a log, and I generally go to bed later than my parents (around 11pm-1am), and get up later than them. Covid has made me more prone to lie ins, not so much for my sister/mother/father who still get up early for working. I have had a dream/nightmare regarding Covid-19. During the ‘dream’ I was in some type of lecture sitting next to some of my course mates. There were some nurses that entered behind us and started to check everyone for Covid with the gun-like beeping machines that I don’t know the name of. When they got to me, I tested positive. I was surprisingly calm, and they told me to have a quarantine hot shower and strip naked in an enclosed shower room. I think after the shower or before, I asked will I be able to bring my laptop and study notes with me to my quarantine room/zone as I have assignments due and a dissertation to work on (which I really did at the time of this dream/nightmare). The nurses (all women interestingly), replied no. That’s when I started to panic, worry and cry, this is when my ‘dream’ now turned into a nightmare. I woke up after and was rather sweaty but was so relieved that it was a dream. I find it interesting how I was only truly concerned about Covid once it started to affect my education/academic life – this is kind of what I feel now, but the dream/nightmare placed this view to the extreme. The impact of Covid-19 (impact of new rules/regulation that are created as a result) was more devastating than the disease, itself – which has a relatively low death rate and isn’t like if you get it, you will definitely 100% die."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health My health is good, as is that of my partner. Although, as someone who is taking immunosuppressants for a health condition, he is not allowed out or to meet people for at least 12 weeks, and I am supposed to keep a distance from him too. But we are in good physical and mental health. We are not naturally pessimistic people, and make sure that we get as many facts as possible before coming to any conclusions, so we keep up to date with the news, and don’t get too down with it. In fact, my own interest in modelling means I am very interested in the rate of infection, the death rate, and so on, so that I can see ahead. I know it’s a gloomy prediction, but I am still happier being able to look at the facts myself. I have not had any paid work for over 6 months now, and my partner’s work has also dried up, so we are a little nervous about when and if we will get work again. With last year’s tax to pay off, a mortgage which still has a few years to run, and gloomy business and economy prospects, I am a little on edge about our finances. I am managing to cope by taking payment holidays, but it’s a problem. It’s also compounded by the fact that my self-employed situation means I don’t get any support from the government, and my partner’s self-employment situation means he is assessed for support on the year before last, during which he earned almost nothing, so gets 80% of almost nothing = nothing at all. Worrying. But we are keeping positive, and also supporting some friends who are more affected emotionally by it all. The Government I am frankly appalled by the decisions and strategy that the UK government has taken. (sorry, I didn’t mean to leave the text in bold, but actually it is how I feel!) We keep up with the news from around the world, and in particular Ireland, as we have family and a house there, so can easily compare what different countries are doing. The response, planning and strategy in other countries has been far, far better than in the UK. I cringe every time I hear Boris Johnson say that we are doing really well, are successful, and it’s all under control. Plus, the daily briefings are lamentable – a host of ministers who haven’t got a clue mumbling on instead of giving us facts that mean something. I worry about the current strategy – saying that people should return to work if they can, but without giving firms the right equipment, support and guidance. I really fear another spike in infections and deaths. The news last night was that the actual death rate is more like 50,000 instead of the 31,000 reported as deaths where a person was tested for the virus. With the current back-to-work strategy and noticing people’s response and behaviour in the past couple of weeks, I fear that we will end up with more than 100,000 deaths by this time next year, a crippled economy from having to continually start-stop, and millions of hours of wasted time while the luckier people get sick and slowly recover. Plus massive unemployment due to firms having to lay people off. In terms of what steps I think the Government will take, I haven’t a clue. I hope that they listen to other countries, scientists and public health experts, but they don’t seem to be doing so. News I start the morning with reading all the headlines on BBC news on my phone, and then dip into it several times a day – perhaps 10 or so. I might listen to a news-on-the-hour on BBC Radio 4 if I already have the radio on while cooking, and also the RTE (Irish) news at 8pm on digital radio. Most evenings I watch the BBC 10 o’clock news on TV before going to bed, and 2-3 times a week some of Newsnight. We tend to stop for tea around 4:30 or 5pm, and I used to tune into the radio broadcast of the press conference, but I have grown tired of the platitudes and meaningless statements, so instead head for the ONS or other government website for an update on the numbers. The 5pm briefing is getting more and more ridiculous, and the 7pm broadcasts from Boris last weekend highly farcical. However, I enjoy watching the Facebook memes that apply different voices to the video, or satirical takes on the words being used in the briefings. I am not aware of anyone who has access difficulties, but every time I see Nicola Sturgeon check behind her to ensure that her sign interpreter is ready to commence, I feel proud of the way that the Scottish First Minister understands the value of truth, plain speaking and honesty, as well as the fact that she is part of a team, not a hero. Work and home life My partner and I are self-employed, so work at home anyway. Neither of us has had any proper work for around 6 months or more, but we are both trying to get work. I have teamed up with another small network of people to address the virtual meetings/conferences market,basedonwhatweusedtodotogetherbefore. It’s beginningtogetsometraction,butsadlynothing for me yet in terms of income. There are one or two projects that have been postponed from physical meetings, and we are trying to reconfigure them for virtual sessions, and when (and if) they happen, I may then begin to relax a bit in the knowledge that business will pick up again. But it’s worrying times. Neither of us can be furloughed as we are self-employed. Neither of us is getting any state support for our work, although I did sign on for Universal Income, which has made a small difference. It’s less than 1/10th of my previous income, and doesn’t cover the mortgage, the balance on the car loan and my credit card debt as we entered the lockdown, but with payment holidays we have a little bit of breathing space. Home life hasn’t been affected – we don’t have kids, so no home-schooling, although people who I work with have commitments that means that some projects are slow to mobilise because they have divided responsibilities. Working from home and (sadly) not having pressing work deadlines means that we can spend some time in the garden, which has been good while the weather was good. Our relationship is not affected apart from both being a little depressed by the lack of income and bleak prospects for now. However, we used to go out a lot, both the theatre/cinema/galleries and to eat out, so we are missing all that. Instead we are Zooming and What’sapping friends and family, and continuing to eat really well (my partner is a really good cook and baker.) Technology We work from home, so are used to staring at a screen to get things done. I have bene using video-conference technology in a limited way for a few years, but it has developed massively in that time. Because of the business I’m in (facilitating strategy and development with groups of people) I have developed my use of Zoom, Teams, and whiteboard apps massively, and have developed some products/services for companies to help them run effective meetings and conferences. While this is just beginningtotakeoff,it’s earlydays,butpeopleseemkeenonwhat we are developing. It will either explode or people will realise that they can do it themselves, without the need for specialists. I thank good sense and foresight for the quality of our broadband – we upgraded a while ago and we really need the extra speed! We use all the apps – FaceTime, Zoom (a LOT), WhatsApp and Houseparty to connect with friends and family. If anything, we are reaching out to people a little more now – we used to rely on going to things like the theatre together, but now we hook up with cocktails and snacks in hand. One observation, though: it’s great to see people, but the chat is banter, not really as deep as a one-to-one on the phone, where you really get to hear how someone is feeling and thinking. Video doesn’t really do emotional reactions. I use Facebook to keep up with friends, but strangely I refer to it less often than I used to. Not sure why – couldbethevolumeofmessagesandthewallofsocialnoise. Maybeit’sbecausepeoplearen’tdoingreally very interesting and novel things, so it’s all a bit same-y. Hmmm… not sure I don’t use twitter much, and Insta not at all, but my partner is a very big user (and is followed a lot) on Instagram, so I get second-hand posts when they are of interest. Shopping and food Online ordering has been a major struggle but is getting better. We have used Ocado for years, and that used to be the main shop each week. However, we found firstly it was almost impossible getting a slot, and then lots of things that were missing like flour and sugar. I am sheltering my partner (he’s on the vulnerable list) so I have been trying to go to the shops as little as possible in order to minimise the risk of bringing an infection back to the house, but it is inevitable that I have to do some shopping locally. That hasn’t been much of a problem, but queuing to get into M&S Food is a novelty. So is wearing gloves and now a face mask when shopping. Not a problem, apart from having to deal with lots of other people who don’t seem to be distancing or protecting others from the risk of infection – there are some gross idiots about who don’t or can’t understand the health risks and real community infection threat. Wefinallygotmypartnerontothecritical list,soTesco’snowoffershimapriority slot, and Ocado now gives me a priority slot each week, so we are managing to get orders. We have also found local wholesalers who have switched to domestic ordering and delivery, which is good. We are foodies, and love to cook – my partner especially –so we tend to shop and eat very well indeed. We bake all our own bread (have done so for a very long time) but getting bread flour has been a real struggle. Our grocery bill used to be around £350 a month and eating out £600-800. Now the grocery bill is £700­odd! We are also drinking a lot more wine, but that probably balances out with the reduction in bar bills when out before. We area also making cocktails for Zoom chats whereas we would have met in a bar somewhere. The lack of exercise, good food and wine has meant that we are now not very fit, but happy! Entertainment and Leisure We haven’t taken up any new hobbies – being self-employed means that I have to focus on trying to get work until it’s time to stop and cook or eat. However, we are at last managing to get to the back of the garden at weekends, a place that was abandoned a few years ago during a home extension project, and we are clearing, weeding, sorting and rebuilding – especially since the weather in April has been exceptionally good. It feels good to be sorting out things, and beingpositive. Lotstodo,buthopefullywewillgetthetimetogetitallsorted. I’malsomanagingtoaddress some DIY jobs that haven’t been done over the past few months, which is good. Also, having to lay off our cleaner means that we are spending several hours every fortnight cleaning, which is hard work but we are combining that with spring cleaning the areas that the cleaner never had time or inclination to do, so some top shelves in the kitchen and space under the bed are getting a proper clean, which feels good. You really appreciate how hard and tiring the work is, and the reliance on professionals! Our watching and listening habits haven’t changed much, but we have been watching series like Money Heist, a Spanish thriller, and Killing Eve. We are watching a few things that we would have gone to see, like 5x15, a monthly series of interesting talks, and a couple of music recitals that we would have gone to see. Not an enormous change, although I do feel that the world is awash with events that are now virtual, and it makes it difficult to choose which ones to watch. Wearen’twatching,listeningorreadinganythingparticularlyrelevanttotheCovidperiod,butwe didwatch Chernobyl at the start of the lockdown, which was really good. Personal hygiene There has been practically no change to personal hygiene for either of us. Just 2 differences: - I now spend more time trying to tame my hair: it used to be cut quite short every 4 weeks, and now  it’s wavy/curly, unruly and 6 weeks overdue a cut  - My consumption of aftershave has dropped to nil, as we don’t go out  Sleep My sleep has only been affected in one way: because we are eating very well, and I am not getting any exercise (I used to just walk hard and fast everywhere – no other exercise) when I go to bed I end up with indigestion and discomfort most nights. But I am sleeping well despite this and no difficulty at all in getting off to sleep or waking with anxiety. If anything, the lack of work means that some mornings I sleep 8 hours, which is a lot for me, so I am managing to half-wake and see my dreams (no, I can’t recall any now). I still go to bed around 11:30 every night, and get up between 6 and 7:30 am. No nightmares, but I sometimes wake thinking about work pressures or potential client situations."

None of us have needed any medical treatment since lockdown commenced, but my daughter has had a period of time signed off sick by her GP because of health anxiety.  My daughter works in a retail environment that has remained open throughout the lockdown because it is deemed to sell essentials. Although the store has put in place various measures to protect staff and customers, my daughter didn’t initially feel safe enough to go to work, especially as she worried about bringing the virus home to us. As time has gone on and we have become familiar with the lockdown situation, we have all gone through various stages of confusion, worry, anxiety, sadness.  Mostly we have enjoyed being all together and settling into a quieter routine of home life.  My wife has struggled with us not being able to travel in our camper van.  My major worries have been about how on earth we will emerge form this situation and whether or not we will manage to create a more resilient and equal society.  My daughter experiences periods of great fear and sadness that her future is so compromised. The Government I have very little trust in our current government.  I believe they came to power on a wave of widespread exhaustion and frustration after years of divisive Brexit debate/disinformation and I am astounded that we have ended up with such a bunch of charlatans in power. I hold the weak-willed and vain David Cameron responsible for leading us into this situation, which opened the way for far-right wealthy populists to come to power in a way they could only have dreamed and schemed of previously. Boris and his crew took way too long to respond on a coordinated national scale, despite all the evidence that was clearly available from the experience of Italy, Spain and the far east.  I still can’t decide if this was due to hubris, incompetence or, more sinister, deliberate opportunism to allow the virus to run its course and then see what emerged from the ruins. As I write this at the end of May we have the staggering and inexcusable situation of Dominic Cummings behaviour, an under par testing regime, lack of reliable and transparent Covid data being shared publicly, scientists being ignored, schools being put in an impossible situation, the devolved nations following a different path, a poorly presented and explained Track and Trace system that doesn’t seem to have captured public trust, a sense that the lockdown is being lifted too soon and only to meet the needs of business, economy being prioritised over public health and to top it all off the Brexit process has been out of public scrutiny so we have no idea what is being negotiated. I am very worried about the future for all of us and do not trust that this government has our best interests at heart. As for the coming months, I suspect the steps will be a rush to lift the lockdown followed by localised lockdowns that will have to occur as the infection rate rises and death rates become unattractive again to the political class. News I have been reading the Guardian daily, as I have for years.  I search the BBC new channel online and I watch both BBC and Channel 4 news, sometimes ITV news. After the first few weeks of lockdown I realised that my compulsion to get the latest news was making me feel angrier and more worried than was good for me – in fact it reminded me very much of how it felt throughout the Brexit ups and downs.  I realised I was looking for ANSWERS that would solve my confusion and of course there are none because no-one knows much about what is going on and we are all dealing with something new and uncharted. I have watched some but not all the daily briefings.  The key ones over the implementation and subsequent relaxation of lockdown I watched and felt a curious mixture of feeling reassured whilst the briefing was happening followed quickly by many questions and feeling cheated afterwards as all the contradictions and inconsistencies arose in my mind. The addition of subtitles and/or signing would be a great idea, I also wonder how all the people in our country who don’t fully understand English will cope with the information they are being given. Work and Home Life My wife and I both work from home already.  I have been a homebased worker for the last 15 years or more and so I am very well set up and used to it. I work for a charity based in Bristol, as a Senior Programme Manager overseeing a range of Public Health projects being delivered in different Local Authorities. In my pre-lockdown world, I would have been out and about meeting people, line managing staff, visiting schools, farms, caterers etc. on a regular basis.  We simply transferred all our contact to Skype, and this has worked fairly well.  Obviously, none of us can be in schools working face to face with teachers and pupils at the moment, but we have managed to maintain fairly good contact with our users even so.  I am very lucky that the SA is an excellent employer with a great track record for looking after its staff, I feel as though they have done a much better job of making me feel safe than our government has. My wife is a therapist and Mindfulness teacher, home based for the last few years after working for about 20 years at Nottingham University Counselling service.  She has also moved to fully online work – using zoom.  Again, this has been successful, but she has lost about 50% of her work overall, luckily, she has been eligible for 2 Government self-employed grants during this period. Our daughter works for Pets at Home and although they have remained open throughout, she has had a period of sick leave due to health anxiety followed by a period of furlough.  She has just started back at work on reduced hours and with much reduced customer contact – which she was worried about at first but seems to be working quite well.  Her employer has been very supportive throughout. We have managed the ‘confinement’ very well. We all love to be together and have many interests and hobbies, we have a nice house with space for each of us to have separate space as needed, we have a nice garden and a range of animals and veg beds that keep us occupied and reduce tensions. We are all three of us very aware that we are lucky, many people in the population have a much more difficult situation to contend with. I am approaching 60 and have been thinking for a few years now about how I want to spend the next ‘chapter’ of my life – both working and leisure.  A few years ago, I had the chance to train as a Forest School leader and have worked 1 day a week in an inner-city primary school running Forest School sessions across the year groups for the past year or so.  This had to stop when lockdown hit and although key worker and vulnerable children have continued to be in school, I have stayed away because of my asthma.  Losing contact with the children and school life, has brought into sharp focus how much benefit I was gaining from this work.  As I write this on 14th June 2020, I have recognised that it is time for me to stop working in my main role, leave and try to earn enough money as a freelance Forest School Leader.  I am again very lucky in that I am just on the verge of inheriting a rental property from my mum, so I am now more likely to be able to afford this move into semi-retirement. Lockdown has certainly given me the time and space to challenge my norms, work out what I truly value and how I want to spend whatever time is left in my life. Technology Being home based workers already we have been used to platforms like zoom and Skype for Business.  These are now an essential part of our working life and on the whole, they work pretty well. I am part of a Ladies Barbershop Chorus made up of nearly 80 women. Before lockdown we met weekly for a three-hour rehearsal in a local school. We have tried to maintain contact and some singing via zoom – but it is a very difficult thing to do and we can’t sing together because of the sound delay inherent in the system. Socially we have been making use of WhatsApp for group chats, photo sharing, keeping in touch and then using zoom for more longer more sustained conversations. My brother lives in Seattle and has been struggling with the Trump response to the virus (well, to everything since he came to power to be honest) and then has recently got involved in the Black Lives Matter protests.  It has been quite frightening talking with him about the social and political situation in the states. Although I am on Facebook, I don’t use Twitter or Instagram – there never seems to be enough time to keep up with all these platforms, even during lockdown!  However, I have been listening to a range of nature podcasts on BCC Sounds, I find this a great way to learn whilst doing more mundane chores. I am also very interested in learning more about nature conservation, rewilding, carbon sequestration etc. so I have been using some of the enforced time at home to listen to and watch TED talks and podcasts on these topics. Shopping and Food I have asthma so my wife and daughter have been doing the majority of our shopping to protect me from exposure. We are all using home made masks when we do go to the shops and have got used to the extra queuing involved, which was very unusual at first. You know us Brits though, we love a good queue. We haven’t changed our home eating habits – we had been following the Joe Wicks 90 day plan before lockdown started so we have continued to do that which is really helpful because it helps us to plan all our meals and shopping for a week at a  time and means we don’t have to nip out for things we suddenly take a fancy to. Initially we couldn’t get hold of yeast and flour, y wife has been a home sourdough baker for some years, so this was a bit frustrating as she could create our own sourdough yeast starters but then not use them until we found some flour. It’s interesting how little opportunistic businesses spring up, she found someone on Facebook locally offering bulk purchases of flour, which she delivered in unmarked plastic bags.  It felt a bit black market and shady to be honest. Before lockdown, we would go out to eat at least once a week, maybe as part of a trip to the cinema but more often with friends.  We have missed this a lot and have filled the gap sometimes by having a takeaway – curry, Thai or fish and chips.  We have saved money though by only eating at home! The coffee habit has been curbed as well, we thought nothing of popping in for a coffee (and maybe lunch or a cake) in one of the many really good independent coffee shops in Nottingham and Beeston near us. I bet we spent at least £15 a week each on coffee alone.  Now we are looking forward to a professionally made coffee – its perhaps the main food/drink stuff that I actively miss. We have bought some artisan coffee by mail order from a few of our favourite places instead. Entertainment and Leisure Visiting friends, eating out, going out for day trips into the countryside, going to the cinema, camper van trips alone or with other friends have been our main social and entertainment activities outside the home. Luckily, we have a dog and live within a few minutes’ walk of some green space alongside the River Erewash so we have been able to carry on with some of this in a modified form. At home, we have kept busy with lots more reading, doing jigsaws, gardening, watching TV series, going for longish bike rides, repainting the kitchen and dining room that has been on our ‘to do’ list for a long time.  My mother died in November last year leaving a rental property with her pottery studio and garden. We have turned a section of her very overcrowded garden into a mini allotment and have spent quite a bit of time clearing, weeding, digging over, adding manure and finally planting out seedlings we started on windowsills at home.  We have planted tomatoes, raspberries, courgettes, beetroot, parsnips and borlotti beans. I have been reading a great deal of nature books – Tristan Gooley, Richard Mabey, Robert MacFarlane, Colin Tudge. On TV we have been watching Killing Eve, Call my Agent, The Great British Sewing Bee, Grayson Perry’s Art Club, National Theatre live, Sex Education. Personal hygiene We all shower daily as before.  Now our daughter has gone back to work she has a shower as soon as she gets home.  We are all washing our hands more often. Otherwise – no change. Sleep My sleep has been unsettled since before lockdown since my mum’s long illness (2 years slowly declining due to kidney failure brought on by repeated chemotherapy over a 20-year period for multiple myeloma) and her death in November 2019. I don’t think Covid and lockdown has made it any worse, although I think I have had some anxiety dreams about not being safe and having to escape."

There are five of us sharing a house. One parent has been ‘shielded’due to a pre-existing health condition while the other adult members of the family have continued to go to work (although less frequently than usual) because they are considered ‘key workers’. I was regularly workingfrom home before the crisis, so my workinglife hasn’t changed much. We have, so far, been lucky and not caught the virus. We do, however, believe that this virus was probably circulating before the Government acted and, as such, believe that a particularly nasty flu that my mother had in February might have been the virus. Since thelockdown began, we haven’t required any medical treatments. My filling fell out within a few days ofdentist’s closing and they advised me to replace it myself with a kit that they provided. As I do not trust myself to do it properly, I have yet to actually replace the filling. My mental health has been okay during the crisis. When the lockdown was initially announced, I did worry whether it would make my anxiety worse. This is primarily because I enjoy socialising, walking and attending events as forms of distraction and I was worried that losing all of these, alongside a sense of claustrophobia from not being allowed to leave the house regularly, might make my anxiety worse. Surprisingly, I have mostly felt the same as usual, which is to say prone to anxiety but able to manage it. I think, goingforward, this might make my mental healthbetter. I’llhave a specific example ofa time where many of what Iconsidered my ‘crutches’ were taken away, but I remained strong and able to cope. I would describe my emotions over the last few weeks as tense, bewildered and uncertain. Most of this is because ofthepolitical response to the crisis. Iamappalled with theGovernment’s handling of it and I believe that our very high death rate can be laid primarily at their door. They failed to act in time – despite having plenty of evidence from other countries who were ahead of us – and their poorly coordinated response has led to needless deaths. Their inability to quarantine those arriving into the country and their decision to stop testing as soon as the lockdown started are their biggest mistakes. Their control over the situation has deteriorated as the lockdown has continued. The recent scandal with Dominic Cummings infuriated me, as I believe it demonstrates the rank hypocrisy of the Government and the contempt they have for ordinary people. I think that had Cummings apologized immediately then the scandal would have disappeared, but his arrogant refusal to do so (along with inexplicable support from the Prime Minister) angered the majority of a nation that had spent weeks making sacrifices in order to keep others safe. More recently, I have been angered by the rush to get teachers back into classrooms (and the framing ofunions as ‘militant’) despite thelack of safety measures in place. As Iwrite this, top scientific advisors are warning that we are not ready for the lockdown to end so suddenly. I have so little faith in the Government and I am amazed that there isn’t wider social unrest. S6049 I have been slightly grateful to be living in Wale, as I believe the Welsh Government to be handling the crisis marginally better than England. I think that their more cautious approach is commendable and I also think that Mark Drakeford is a more intelligent, cogent and trustworthy leader than Boris Johnson. I have been annoyed by the media constructing a narrative in which the devolved nations do not conform to England, whereas in fact England has often been acting out of step with the other countires. I have also been skeptical of the way that the NHS has been used politically during the crisis. I believe the bravery of frontline staff, and key workers generally, has been incredible and worthy of praise, respect and reward. However, Ibelieve thegovernment quickly seizedupon thepublic’s gratuity to theNHS in order to construct anarrative whereby workers coulddie as part of a ‘heroic sacrifice’ to the cause of coronavirus. The truth is that providing adequate protective equipment and having a better prepared and funded health service would have saved hundreds ofNHS staff. Events like the weekly ‘clap for carers’ took the spotlight away from the very really failings that were causing the staff to experience such dangerous working conditions. I experienced a similar cynicism with Captain Tom, the centenarian who raised millions for the NHS. Instead of focusing on why an elderly man needed to raise money for a public institution, the Government and media used him to distract from much greater problems. Iprimarily watch and read theBBC for information about thevirus but I’ve occasionallyfound their reporting to be biased and pro-government -specifically when Laura Kuenssberg is involved. She got involved when the Dominic Cummings story broke to essentially defend him on social media, and it was surreal (and suspicious) to see a journalist advocate so much for a political aide. I also think that print media has generally been massively irresponsible, reducing complex issues to inane headlines, failing to hold the government to account and, occasionally, peddling lies. Their inaccurate reporting about the lockdown ending early (and their refusal to acknowledge that each nation has different rules) has no doubt contributed to the gradual breakdown of the lockdown. I also get a lot of news via Twitter, both by following accounts by BBC News and by seeing what other users have posted. Much of this is like an echo chamber, because I primarily follow people who share my own political views and are equally outraged at the Government’s handling of the crisis. Idon’t see howtheEnglishGovernment can justify not having a BSL interpreter at their press conferences. BSL interpreters are also available for the Welsh press conferences and it seems needlessly exclusionary of the English Government not to follow suit. As a student, I’ve been able to continue to write from home. I have tried my best to research as usual, but this has been made harder by limited online resources and the continued shutting of the libraries. I am also a tutor within the University and my seminars were moved online because of the lockdown. I used Microsoft Teams to achieve this, although this process was complicated by the fact that the University does not consider tutors to be staff. Because of this, I missed e-mails that were only sent to staff and I was not able to access online guides about e-learning. This was, eventually, rectifiedbut, bythat point, I’d done much of the work myself. The engagement from students was minimal, but it is difficult to know whether this is because of apathy or because they are dealing with their own (or family members’) virus-related issues. Due to having a parent that is shielding, my brother and I have been going on weekly shopping trips. I have found that it is very difficult to maintain actual social distancing in supermarkets, but that generally, for the sake of being able to get aroundquickly, this doesn’t particularlybother me. My eating habits have changed slightly because my brother has been cooking most of our meals. I am probably, overall, eating healthier than Iusually wouldbecause Idon’t have the access to fast food – although my lack of exercise S6049 is probably counteracting any benefits. I tend to go for a brief walk every day – which takes about 15 minutes – but nothing more. I have primarily relied on streaming and catch-up services for my entertainment, although I also found the National Theatre Live free streams on YouTube very entertaining and an amazing resource to have for free. As a family, we began a homemade pub quiz on the first Wednesday of the lockdown and have maintained this tradition since. This pandemic has made me think about some of the businesses that I use. For example, I’ve begun ordering from the nearest independent bookshop rather than use Amazon, which I read was treating its employees particularly poorly during the crisis. (I have, however, maintained my subscription to their Prime video service – so maybe I am just a hypocrite!) I also began subscribing to the Big Issue, even though I never buy it usually, because I could imagine how much it was struggling. I have been avoiding video conferencing as much as possible during the lockdown because I feel uncomfortable usingit. The main way that I’ve kept in touch withfriends is throughWhatsApp. Ihave tried to maintain my usualpersonal hygiene routine during thelockdown and, in some cases, I’m probably doing some activities more than usual. Whereas in thepast Iwould’ve stayedin mypajamas for the entirety of a Saturday or Sunday, I now tend to get dressed every day. I think this is because so much else about my routine has changed that this feels like something that I can control. My sleep patterns felt quite disturbed during the beginning of the lockdown and I had lots of dreams that felt disturbing and disruptive. They were the kind that I forgot almost as soon as I woke, but I remember a feeling of being anxious during them. These have generally eased as the lockdown has continued, which I’ve taken to mean that I’mgetting accustomed to theinitial stress that it caused."

I also have a problem with a bridge which has now come out 3 times during lockdown, so far I have managed to stick it back in but not ideal and I really should see a dentist but it isn’t an emergency, so will have to persevere. I have managed to exercise every day, preferably first thing in the morning, and I am sure that has really helped me during this time. I am lucky enough to live by the sea, so can run or cycle round the harbour daily which I find tough particularly when its windy, but also quite calming. You look out to the sea, tide is continually changing, but it goes on regardless. Government I think the Government have done the best they could have, mistakes have been made and in hindsight I am sure choices may well have been different, but they were dealing with something so unprecedented what else could they do. Although the virus hit us later than the European countries, some would say we should have followed how these countries reacted, but no one country will have got it right. Each country is different, and not only each country, each region is different. We have been one of the lucky ones so far with relatively few cases, but then we are a rural county, we have no big manufacturing plants, no really large cities, and no motorways, plus we have lots of countryside. New measures come into place tomorrow with the opening up of places of work, garden centres, golf clubs and the ability to meet another person outside of your own home. Obviously the Government will be monitoring very closely what happens with the spread of the virus so we may well end up having to go back to lockdown, desperately hoping though that people are sensible and gradually we are allowed to do more and more things. News We watch Breakfast Time and the 6’o’clock news on the BBC every day and also read The Times newspaper daily. On top of this we follow the BBC throughout the day on our phones via the app. At the beginning of the epidemic we did watch the 5pm broadcast but rarely do so now. I think you can just be overloaded, and plus everything is repeated in the 6pm news. After the first couple of weeks I decided not to watch it as I got extremely fed up listening the journalist asking the same question over and over again, in fact we will often mute not only the journalist but also those hosting the shows as they can be just as bad. Probably at this time it would be a good idea to have a Sign language interpreter on the briefings. Work and home life Glad to say that both my husband and I are retired so we were not affected by the furlough scheme. There are only the two of us living in our house, which is a very comfortable 4 bedroomed house with a nice garden so there is plenty of space for us both. This has allowed us space, so we do not get on top of each other. I do my exercise first thing in the morning before my husband gets up, and then he goes off for a walk for 45 minutes after coffee. We both love working in the garden and also the allotment so enjoy the time that we now have to tend all our plants in a way we never seemed to have time for normally. 2 MO NO: P1796; Female; Age 73: Married; Bridport; Dorset Retired Technology I read recently a comment about how we would have coped with a Lockdown ten years ago? I cannot begin to imagine as for me technology has been one of the major winners at this time. I cannot claim to be a techno expert but I like to keep as up to date as possible but this time now has meant I can experiment with different forms, learn how to use technology and have enjoyed this. Amazing what you can do when you have the time. I love Zoom something I had never heard of, and at first I was a bit nervous but now I am exploring all the options of Zoom. I decided that I wanted to see if we could run our Executive meetings for the Inner Wheel via Zoom and we have, and now we are opening up to have virtual coffee mornings with all the Inner Wheel members. A lot of these ladies have problems even using their phones or computers but with a bit of encouragement and patience we are getting there. I have used WhatsApp and Face time for a long while now so this was nothing new, although I am using WhatsApp video more to keep in contact with 2 friends on a weekly basis. Haven’t tried Houseparty or TicTok yet but who knows. I have used Facebook for many years now but do find that it has been a great source of local information. I have never been a great one for posting a lot on FB but have done a bit more recently. Shopping & food I have always done my grocery shopping on line so that was not a new experience for me, what however was a new experience was problems getting a delivery slot, in fact it was impossible to start with. As I am over 70 I was accepted by both Sainsburys and Waitrose as being in the vulnerable sector so should have priority. However Sainsburys has been virtually impossible to get a slot although I think I have now worked out when to book a delivery slot. The trouble we have is that there is only one Sainsburys close by that covers a vast area. Waitrose on the other hand is local for a start, so before I could get delivery I did their click and collect and it was picked up by our son and delivered to us. However I now seem to be able to get delivery slots with them quite easily. Previously though I used to get a delivery from Sainsburys once a fortnight and then go into Waitrose once a week to top up on fresh fruit and vegetables. Now though I have a delivery once a week and then if I need anything else I will pick up at our local Spar shop when I pick up my paper. When there was all this panic buying I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to get all the food I needed, and even now there are certain items which seem to be in short supply, ie flour a prime example. A lot of our local shops now offer delivery services and so I get meat delivered from the butcher and today I have the fish man from our local market delivering me some fish. We can also get a click and collect for fruit and vegetables and of course lots of restaurants and doing takeaways although we haven’t availed ourselves of this. Entertainment & Leisure It amazes me how we have adjusted to this lockdown. Both of us are very active, were always out and about, very involved in clubs etc but all this changed. We got into a daily routine and can’t often believe that it is Friday again. We haven’t changed our drinking habits, we allow ourselves a drink over the weekend so Friday night is a highlight. My exercising routine has definitely changed as I used to go to the gym or swim 4-5 times a week as well as playing netball twice a week. So decided to go cycling 3-4 times a week and then run the other 3 days. I love cycling, something I only took up just over a year ago when I entered a mini triathlon and now regularly cycle 15-20 kms at a go, but I go first thing in the morning, which to my mind is the best time, and it sets me up for the day. Not keen on running but it gives a bit of variety to the exercising and gets me out in the fresh 3 MO NO: P1796; Female; Age 73: Married; Bridport; Dorset Retired air. Having said this I am not keen on going out when its raining, but here we have been lucky in that it hasn’t rained that much and most of the mornings have been lovely. Going round the lovely fishing harbour where we live is amazing and there is plenty of space. also now see the same people most days and even if there are new people everyone says hello. Just wondering if this is going to change now that you are allowed to go out and exercise as much as you want, think I might resent the newcomers. I have been doing far more gardening than before, I am able to spend time in the garden and enjoy the beauty of the garden. There were plenty of jobs around the garden that I never seemed to have time for that have now been done, and thoughts of what we now want to do in the garden are in the planning stage. I thought I would be doing more sewing and well I might except for the fact that I would rather be outside if the weather is good so consequently the quilt I started just before lockdown is still not finished. I also envisaged reading more books but this also has not happened, I still seem to be reading only when I go to bed, although my husband has just about finished reading Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror & the Light a mammoth task but accomplished probably in a much shorter time than normal. We signed upto to Netflix and also have Amazon Prime so we have had plenty to watch and have enjoyed lots of different programmes, making a change from all the dire news about coronavirus. My husband is surprised that he is not actually bothered about playing golf at present, and is amazed that he feels like this. He regularly played 2-3 times a week but with the new update that he can play he wonders if he really wants to. However our son who took up the game again last year I know is desperate to play so no doubt he will persuade my husband to go and play. It will not be the same as there will not be the ability to meet up with his golfing mates for their regular playing times, that is still a long way off. Personal hygiene. This has not changed at all except for the amazing amount of hand washing that has taken place. Everything else though is exactly the same, I still have my daily shower & wash my hair, put on my makeup and dress as for a normal day. Obviously I am not wearing a lot of my clothes as I am not going out and about. Sleep I am not a particularly good sleeper at the best of times and at the beginning of the Lockdown I was not sleeping at all well, in fact we decided to sleep in separate rooms as we were keeping each other awake. I also had some really bad dreams to start with but I am glad to say that these seemed to have stopped. I have to get up in the night and often I struggle to get back to sleep but then again I have some good nights. Occasionally I do take a couple of paracetamol tablets to help with my sleep but I only do this if I haven’t slept well for a few nights. 4"

I feel increasingly isolated, which makes me feel extremely sad, and I often break down in tears. I have also been placed on furlough leave from my job – originally until June, then July, and now until October – which has taken away my regular routine. This, in turn, increases my anxiety, and I struggle to fill the time each day. Sometimes, I don't even see the point in getting out of bed. I am also filled with dread at the possibility of losing my job completely, especially in a struggling economy. The Government Despite my personal troubles, I do believe the Government were right to implement a lockdown. It helps prevent the virus' spread. However, it annoys me when working-class people are giving hefty fines for going to shops, visiting family, etc. (not that I condone their actions) but a government advisor can drive all the way to Barnard Castle and get off scot free. I also found myself being angry at the Black Lives Matter protests: not because I don't support their message and their fight for equality, but because they broke lockdown rules to gather publicly. I am so fearful of a second spike of the virus and an extended lockdown, I would have much preferred that they kept their protests virtual rather than risking everybody's health. Now that the Government are opening businesses back up, I can only hope they continue to track the cases and R numbers, and that they will close down again if they have to. True, I hate lockdown, and I know a stable and strong economy is important too, but can we really put a price on people's lives? Mass Observation Archive –Spring 2020 Directive - M6884 News I read the news online,usuallythroughTwitter and the BBC News website.As we don't have aTV licence(legally, since we don't watch liveTV), we don't watch the broadcasts: I tendto read thesummaries andkeypoints on theBBCwebsite afterwards.That being said, I tryto limit myexposure tonews, as it makes me nervous and deepens my depression.

TechnologyMyself, myboss andcolleagues haveweeklychats onZoom, just tokeep in touch and help support each other. I also takeYoga classes through Zoom onceaweek to stay active, andregularlyuse ittochat with friends. I also playvideogames with friends over the internet whilst talking with them through aheadset. I am something of a gadget girl, soI havetakento all of this eagerly. Technologyhas been the saviour ofmysocial life, andhas helped keep me sane. I have mainlybeen using social media to look at funnyposts or to follow pages about my hobbies –to have a fundistraction from thesadness fuelled bythe pandemic. I doread the news in brief, but trytolimit myexposure to itto avoid anxietyattacks. I also use itto sharemywritingor photos of things I havecrafted (seeEntertainment and Leisure below). Shopping andfood Whenlockdown was firstdeclared, mypartner andI didn't exactlypanic buy, but we did pick up a fewextra frozenfoods and some tinned goods,just in case. Rice,pasta and bread turnedout to be averywise investment -especiallythe latter, as Ibought an extra loaf to freeze -and soupensured we hadalways had somethingin for lunch. Luckily, we have amilkman,so our milk supplywas ongoing. The onlyshop in our village is aM&S Food storeat the petrol station. To startwith, it was hardto getcertainthings, liketea bags and vegetables, but over time,supplies have returned tonormal. It is more expensivethan the supermarkets, butyou payfor convenience andhigher quality. Nowthat supermarkets have re-opened, we drive tothe Aldi in the next village about once aweek to doa bigger shopto tryand save money. Mypartner and I have beeneating takeaways more often: usuallyas aform ofcomfort Mass ObservationArchive–Spring2020Directive-M6884 eating, and togive us something to look forward to. Doing the weeklybig shops has helped us cut that down, as it ensures we alreadyhave food in the house touseup. Entertainment andLeisure Duringlockdown, I have learned how to loom knit, and enjoymakinghats. Iwillgive some to relatives, anddonate others to charity. Each hat takes a fewhours to knit, so it is a fun activityI can do topass long evenings -usuallywhilst listeningto music andrelaxing in a comfychair. I also write as a hobby, and have entered a fewstories into competitions run byother users of the writingwebsites... winning a few prizes along theway. Writing in itself is another fun activity – allowingme to leave this troubled worldbehind to brieflyescape into a fun fictional one – andthe prizes haveprovidedaconfidenceboost, helping to alleviate mydepression. In addition, Ihave cleared outseveral bags ofoldclothes from cupboards andwardrobes, whichI intend to give to charityshops once lockdownis lifted. Ialso cleared out some old CDs and DVDS, whilst mystepdaughter cleared outallofher old toddler toys. Thesewere placedin cardboard boxes marked “FREE”, which we put out on thepavementoutside of our housefor those in the neighbourhood totake. This was much appreciated,and other houses have since followedsuit. The fewitems thatremain will also be donatedto charity. We,like severalof our neighbours,also took part in theThursdaynight clap for carers, whichwas verymoving – although, in manyways, I also think peopleclapped for themselves: proud of coming together as a nation, proudofkeeping up the strength to cope with everything thathas happened, andis continuing to happen. I certainlyfelt that wayattimes. Mymusic taste is quiteeclectic:I listenfrom everything torock andopera, tomusicals and bubblegum pop. OnTV, comedies like Taskmaster,Blackadder and Bottomhave been fun and sometimes sillydistractions from the pandemic, bringingme some much-needed laughter. I also like watching historical documentaries to learn more aboutvarious famous figures and events, as well as quizzes to keep mybrain busy: mypartner and Ihave fun guessing theanswers together. PersonalHygieneI continueto bathe nightlyduringlockdown:bothto stayclean, and becauseI find bubble baths relaxing. I am washing clothes less oftenas I tendto wear the same clothes for a coupleof days atatime. Theyare notgetting dirtyas I haven't beenleaving the house.

Iwash itonce a week, as I have always done, to give myhair achance to produce its natural oils and maintain its strength before cleansingit.

Mass-Observer H1745 describes themself as female; age 69; widow / living with partner; researcher / writer / editor.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","Mass Observation Spring Directive 2020 Female H1745 Age 69 Widow/Living with partner London Researcher/Writer/Editor Part 2: Covid 19 (Update) Health I've been keeping a 'Corona Diary' alongside my usual journal (which I now write every weekend) and not long after the Covid crisis began to take a hold in the UK, I wrote that hospitals must be places most people consciously wanted to avoid. Late on 21 April, I suffered a sudden oesophageal bleed (resulting in a partial faint and copious black stools). I knew enough to understand that I was bleeding internally and the following morning rang my GP surgery. I was advised to get myself to my local A & E Department as quickly as possible (St George's, Tooting) and ended up spending the following eight days as an inpatient there. When I went into hospital, various wards had been designated 'Covid 19' wards and had large notices on their doors, warning people that they were now entering a 'restricted area' in which full personal protective equipment was required. During my eight-day stay, I had no direct evidence of any of the 24 patients there having the virus, apart from one night when someone in another three-bedded bay coughed persistently for a couple of hours. I heard her (or him) the following night but not for such a long period and I didn't hear them at all apart from that. Patients were asked to keep to their bays, some nursing and care staff (but not all) wore facemasks and when I was taken to other parts of the hospital for tests, I was required to wear a facemask ('for your own protection') and the porters who took me there in a wheelchair (no walking allowed!) had to don facemasks, latex gloves and thin plastic aprons. My partner came up to the ward several times. No visitors allowed (because of Covid) so he had to stand on the other side of the main ward door and briefly talk to me (and hand me the things he'd brought for me). Until the final day, when he came to collect me to take me home, there had been no warning notices on the ward doors, but that day, he said (I didn't notice) there was a big Covid 19 warning notice and one of the eight bays was sealed off. It seems I just got out in time! The ban on visitors probably caused problems for a lot of people. I was lucky as I had my mobile phone with me and kept in regular touch with my partner, family and friends. An elderly lady who was in the bed opposite mine for a few days was not so lucky. She spoke very little English and staff found it very hard to communicate with her (few interpreters available). Had a family member been able to visit and translate, that lady's hospital experience could have been quite different. As it was, she may not even have understood why no visitors were allowed! My emotions have been very up and down over the last few weeks but that has been more related to my health problems than to the effects of the lockdown. I have a back problem which makes it very difficult for me to sit, so a lot of social venues that many people take for granted (pubs, restaurants, cafes etc) are just not possible for me to visit so that lockdown hasn't hit me nearly as hard as it must've hit some people! The Government I have to say I don't think the British Government has covered itself in glory over its handling of the Covid crisis. Particularly problematic, I think, was the failure to close our airports, so that when other countries were refusing to allow people in and out, we were still getting a steady flow of people coming into the country without adequate checking. There was also a fiasco over testing and provision of personal protective equipment (especially in care homes) and a failure to include deaths in care homes in the official statistics for many weeks. There's also been a lot of conflicting and unclear advice on social distancing and lots of duplicity and lying on the part of senior government officials which has meant a reduction in public trust and probably lower compliance with social distancing rules. I admit I wouldn't have wanted to have been a government minister at this very difficult time, but other countries seem to have handled the situation rather more efficiently! In terms of what steps I think the government will take in the coming months, I hope that our Prime Minister will not be over-influenced by those who want to get the country's economy out of its slough of despond at any price. We've already had some slacking of the lockdown rules: people can now go outside to take exercise for as long as they wish every day, it's OK to drive some distance to take that exercise, garden centres have reopened and car showrooms and open-air markets will be opening on 1 June (all with strict social distancing requirements). Primary school children should be returning to school on 1 June (against a lot of opposition from teachers) and it is hoped that shops will be able to open from 15 June provided they adhere to strict guidelines. I do worry that this is all happening a bit too quickly (and that there will be a second peak in virus cases and deaths which will necessitate a second lockdown) and am not confident that the British public can be relied on to 'do the right thing' at all times! News I've been getting my news mainly from the radio (BBC Radio Four) and the newspapers. Occasionally I've also caught the 10.00 BBC television news broadcasts, but generally I've missed them because I've been doing something else in the evening or someone has rung me at the relevant time. I haven't been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5.00 although I have caught Nicola Sturgeon's presentation a few times. I haven't had any problems accessing the news and I don't know of anyone else who's had problems. I had noticed that Nicola Sturgeon's briefings had BSL interpreters but am surprised there haven't been any for the British ones! Gold star for Scotland and black mark for the UK briefings! Work and home life I retired from full-time work some time ago and am receiving my state pension plus a small occupational pension, so I'm one of the lucky ones. I don't have to worry about my employer going bust or losing my job so I'm really very lucky! The lockdown hasn't affected my home life nearly as drastically as it will have affected those of many people. I have a back problem that which makes it very difficult for me to sit, so can't go to restaurants, cafes, pubs, theatres, cinemas etc and what you don't have, you don't miss! The lockdown has meant that my partner and I have spent more time together. We run two U3A groups (a creative writing group and a book group) and have continued to run both using Skype. In 'non-lockdown' conditions, I'm at the local leisure centre, either doing a Pilates class or using the gym, around five days a week but with the centre closed, we're doing a Pilates class twice a week (on Zoom) and having a longish walk by our local river every afternoon. The only real difference for me is that I can't go to the local shops (apart from food stores and chemists, none are open), can't go to the leisure centre and can't visit my friend N in a nursing home (I usually go to see him approximately every week and a half). We've adapted to the situation by making increased use of technology (Zoom and Skype) and mobile and landline telephones. This week we did a Zoom playreading with my mother, my sister and a friend. My partner, P, would normally be out and about a lot more, going to classes, attending meetings etc, so we're spending more time together but we both have things we're working on (I'm currently editing a book for a friend in India and trying to edit my autobiography) so we're not getting on each other's nerves and we're really enjoying our daily walk together. Technology I've written about this to some extent in the previous section on work and home life. I'm now making a great deal more use of Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp and my mobile phone to keep in touch with family and friends, and have found all these things really helpful. One woman I met at university many years ago, with whom I'd been keeping in touch at Christmas, suddenly got an urge to contact me around the time lockdown began and eventually wrote because the phone number she had for me wasn't working. It's great to have made a stronger contact with her and I've also been contacting other friends and family members more often. I don't use Twitter or Instagram at all. I do read other people's posts and 'follow' organisations I'm interested in on Facebook but have only once used it to post something myself! My partner and I had already been running a creative writing group and a book group (both U3A groups) which we transferred to Skype immediately lockdown began. We also do Pilates classes twice a week on Zoom and I do a weekly spiritual development group (currently using WhatsApp but probably moving to Zoom). I'd say the lockdown has greatly increased my use of Zoom (I'd never used it before), Skype and WhatsApp and also significantly increased my mobile phone use but hasn't encouraged me to use Twitter or Instagram. Shopping and food Before the arrival of the virus and lockdown, I was going to our local Tesco Metro store twice a week to buy food, with occasional visits to other shops (Sainsbury's and Morrisons) to buy things I couldn't get at Tesco's. I continued to do this when the virus hit, but pretty soon shopping for food became difficult, as some items were extremely hard to get. Eggs became as rare as hen's teeth, you couldn't get a packet of loo rolls anywhere, and pasta, tinned food and other long-life foodstuffs were being swept off the shelves by panic-buyers who gave little thought to other shoppers with families to feed. I ended up buying items for various people who were unable to leave their homes and had several offers from young people to help us with shopping if we needed it (one from an ex­neighbour who has three young children and a hungry husband to feed, so must have found it difficult enough buying food for them, let alone getting anyone else's shopping!) There were real problems (locally but I think nationally as well) with people causing food shortages by panic buying. I quite often returned from a shop having managed to find only half the things on my shopping list and my partner and I resolved to take the shopping trolley out every day to try to get the items we needed. Shops pretty soon put a stop to stockpiling by limiting essential items like eggs, flour, tinned goods and pasta to a certain number per customer and gradually things did return to more like normal. At one time, going to the supermarket was quite a depressing experience, with many shelves completely bare. Now, things are back to almost normal and I'm not having any difficulty in getting items we need. Before the virus struck, I did shop online, but only for books, some clothes and a few other items – never for food. I didn't even bother to try to put in an online order for food, because I'd heard so many people saying you had to wait hours to grab a delivery slot, couldn't even get in to supermarket websites or had to accept delivery slots four weeks in advance! My eating and cooking habits haven't really changed. My partner bought a lot of pasta (when it finally became easier to get) but it's all still sitting on the shelf. We don't eat a lot of it and unless I make an effort to remember it's there, there's a risk it could go out of date before we use it. We've also got far more tinned fish, tinned vegetables, soup and tinned fruit than we usually have, and feel maybe we need to keep this for a while just in case one of us gets the virus! Entertainment and leisure I haven't changed the way in which I've entertained myself, although my method of participation has changed. We now have Skype and Zoom meetings instead of hosting U3A creative writing and book group meetings here and elsewhere, do Pilates classes on Zoom and instead of going to the gym several times a week I join my partner for a local walk. I continue to listen to the radio (mainly BBC Radio Four) and have been amused recently to listen to 'The Archers' (a programme to which I'm devoted!) ransmogrify itself into 'The Archers Soliloquies'. It was odd enough listening to episodes involving an Ambridge totally untouched by the virus but now (because they can't get the cast together to record it!) we have individual characters revealing their innermost thoughts and reflections all alone. I read somewhere that the virus does reach Ambridge – maybe it already has and that's why they are in their own bedrooms recording episodes! As I mentioned earlier, I can't take part in a lot of things many people take for granted (going to the cinema, restaurants, concerts, pubs, etc) because of severe back problems which make it very painful for me to sit. So my life hasn't changed much in that respect. I've never been a big television-watcher and that hasn't been changed by the virus (though I have watched the television news more than I used to!) I continue to read novels and other books – have one book a month to read for our book group and often manage to squeeze in another per month. Personal hygiene My personal hygiene hasn't changed during lockdown. I now have showers at home (rather than at the gym) but still with the same regularity (every three or four days – have continued in my usual pattern of having a good wash twice a day in addition to showering when I need to wash my hair.) I'm not a shower-a-day person! Sleep I've had disturbed sleep for over 40 years and lockdown hasn't changed that. I wake between four and six times every night (starting an hour or an hour and a half after going to sleep), sometimes stay awake for several hours in the night and often can't get back to sleep from around 6.00 (especially in the summer, when it's much lighter in the mornings). I've continued to go to bed around midnight and get up at 8.00 (sometimes a bit earlier). No particular dreams to report!"

The pandemic has been a bit of nightmare for me, as going to the shops can produce a very high level of anxiety, particularly when people don’t adhere to the two-metre social distancing rule or are not wearing gloves and a mask. There are two types of people who do this – those who don’t believe Covid-19 is any worse than a bad flu, so they totally disregard it and anyone else who might be worried about it, particularly in public places. These are usually older men where I live. The second are the clueless ones who vaguely ponder at the shelves in the supermarket and block up the aisle. Whenever I ask them to move, there’s an apology. These are usually younger men. My mental health has been a rollercoaster during this time. I’m trying to do a doctorate during a global pandemic and keep my parents (aged 70) safe and well, so there’s a lot riding on my shoulders. There have been days where I’m anxious, fedup, feelingoppressedandtearful. Other days, I’ve felt fine and just got on with it. Activity makes it better, but I was naïve to think I could just bury my head in academic work. That hasn’t always been the case and I’m constantly having to remind myself that what I’m doing is enough. Luckily, I finished therapy before this started, and I have superb support network. Every week, me and some friends have a Zoom meeting on Sunday afternoons to catch up – we chat about our week and our shared interests. Additionally, Ialso enjoyotherones whenthere’s atweet-a-long, where a DVD of choice is selected, and you all watch it together from the safety of your own homes. Those regular fixtures go part way to keeping myspirits buoyed up. Ialso write adiarysoIcan articulate what I’mfeeling properly and follow the thought through enoughto determineif it’s a result of OCD, the lockdown, or regular stress. The government I think most of the political decisions that have been made are utterly appalling. The delay in action was reprehensible, as is the involvement of Dominic Cummings and his Machiavellian machinations. I agree with the lockdown, but a lot of the political manoeuvring has been very bad, as has the fudging by both the government and the media, dressing up their efforts as heroic, when in actual fact, they’ve starved front line workers of PPE, the NHS has been crippled by austerity for over a decade, they’ve quietly cracked on with Brexit while the nation is preoccupied, they suggested herd immunity and wrote off older populations, and BAME populations are the ones most likely to get Covid-19. To top it all off, England now has the highest rates of infection in Europe. It’s hardly surprising. Never trust a Tory. The news I’m wary of watching too much news because it’s like someone with a megaphone blasting empty analysis at you 24/7. I’m also aware that much of the news is biased. The BBC blotted their copy book over Brexit and champion the Tories for the older generations, and the right-wing press (such as The Daily Mail and The Sun) have cynically temporarily stopped being racist towards BAME NHS workers because their readership was falling dangerously low. They really are the worst of society. I’ve tried to warn my family about how watching too much news provokes anxiety, but they don’t listen. I get my news online from a variety of sources – Reuters, The Guardian, Al Jazeera, and academics close at hand to those working on Covid-19. I am very grateful that I can interpret what they’re talking about. My family like to watch the daily briefings at 5pm on the BBC. At first, they were frantic that I shouldn’t miss it, but I asked them not to shout for me when it’s on because some days – to preserve my mental health – I don’t want to know. I get much more reliable information from trusted sources online, anyway. I wouldn’t trust the government as far as I could throw them. Apparently, though, Nicola Sturgeon makes a lot of sense and has aBSLinterpreter. She’s aclever woman. I like her. Longterm, I’m actually thinking about moving to Scotland. She is a ray of hope in a sea of grey ineptitude and connivance. Work As I say, I’ve been working hard on my thesis during the lockdown. Whereas once upon a time, I could go into university and see my supervisors and friends face-to-face, it’s now all online. My supervisors have been wonderful all throughout this, and have been a real support, not just with the work, but in maintaining all of our work/life balances. I will also be doing my assessments online. Usually, I’d welcome this, but I wanted to gain more teaching experience, so I’m a bit sad it has been reduced to this medium. Iworked at apub, but theyhaven’t even contacted me about furlough, nor did theyget back to me about myP45 if they are going to furlough me. I’m just cattle to them. Technology See above. Shopping & Food Aside from the stress of shopping in the supermarket, I am now more wary about how much I use when cooking meals, knowing that I can’t just nip out and buy more. It’s made me very conscious about making stocks last. Also, I live rurally, and the stress of the supermarket has made many of my neighbours turn to farm shops for vegetables and meat. It’s more expensive, but it does taste better. At one point, there was a barter system going on over garden fences. I’ve also started growing my own veg, which I’ve wanted to do for a long time. I love gardening and it’s great for my mental health, so going more into growing my own produce has been a real concerted effort. I have radishes, peppers, herbs, lettuce and eventually beetroot and potato growing in our garden. That is a real positive aspect of the lockdown – increased self-sufficiently. I would love to have an allotment! Entertainment & Leisure I am quite a creative person, so I have multitude of projects on the go. Aside from the aforementioned gardening, I have taken up my nature photography again, walking out over the fields to take shots of birds and bees and squirrels. I have also been doing a series of silly photographs for people’s entertainment on Twitter – it has quite a following! I’ve taken up writing fiction again, and I’ve also been binge-watching box sets. I like classic stuff like old Doctor Who and I, Claudius. One night, I made a diorama for my figurine collection. I used to love the gym and I’ve really missed it. In its place, I’ve (tried to) eat sensibly and use a big bag of compost as weights to work out with. I’ve also been following Tai Chi classes on YouTube. I’ve been listening to a podcast on Ancient Greece as well. I’m rarely bored. Personal hygiene I’ve kept up to my personal hygiene religiously, as part of an established routine – shower every morning, brush teeth, increase of washing hands. I’m well aware that this is vital in maintaining physical and mental health. Sleep My sleep has been massively disturbed of late. I am used to nightmares, but they have been more vivid of late. Often, I will wake up in the middle of the night at least once and swear there’s apresence in the room. Idon’t think it’s anything supernatural, it’s just an embodiment of the general unease of living during a global pandemic. Nevertheless, I now usually sleep with the light on. Even if they aren’t nightmares I experience, the vividness unnerves me. My dreams have contained imagery such as clipboards (this is usual – it signifies my need for control, possibly of my OCD), being driven (this is usual too – driving for me means control of my life, so right now, being driven means there’s something bigger going on) and crawling through dark spaces. The other night, I changed the sheets on my bed, took the full compliment of sleeping meds I’m prescribed and had a shower. It was the best night’s sleep I’ve had in ages. My family have had trouble sleeping too, and are often awake from the early hours."

We have not had any health issues during the lock-down and don’t have any underlying medical issues.  I feel that we have worked very hard to follow the rules and not get this virus, so as we come out of it I don’t want to jeopardise things now by not being cautious.  We do not feel as though we want to rush to mix in groups or go to pubs or restaurants -that isn’t because we are scared or worried but we feel that caution is best at this time -we are not out of the woods yet and we feel that there could easily be a second spike in the autumn if not before.     I would rather be cautious now than put myself at risk -my husband is a smoker and slightly overweight and feels he would be at risk so  we will have a chilled out summer and won’t be doing things like gathering in groups or  going on public transport until later in the year when I hope that the virus will have either blown itself out  (this seems to happen with viruses)  or we will have a vaccine or much better therapeutic drugs -ideally a mixture of all three! In terms of emotions -I feel that the pandemic has brought out the best in people and the worst.    I don’t want to say that I enjoyed some aspects of it as that would be entirely inappropriate but at the beginning I did feel a bit of a sense of relief that nothing was expected of me in terms of going out or doing things socially.  It was lovely to hear the birds singing outside and the traffic in my road was like it was 30 years ago when I moved here.  None of it was as bad as I expected and unintended benefits have happened although I do realize this would not have been the case if either of us had fell ill, felt like we were going to lose our jobs or if we had the worry of elderly relatives. I also feel that it is weird as we have been operating in our little bubble and yet out there are who people have been losing relatives and going through awful things -so all my feelings have been tinged with a bit of guilt and I did feel at times as though I should be doing more, such as volunteering. As time has gone on I feel slightly uneasy over what I should and should not be doing as things seems to have  become more vague.  At the beginning and through the main part of the lockdown I felt that there was a real community spirit and people were looking after each other and doing some wonderful  things. However, as the lockdown has been eased and the weeks have gone on I feel that some people have gone a bit mad in terms of reckless behaviour ignoring social distancing and gathering in groups -I was particularly upset with the scenes of people flooding to the beaches  -even though most public toilets were not open.  Much as I love the sea and have been missing visits to the coast -no one has a pathological need to go to a beach -I think the behaviour we have seen recently is astonishing and so selfish and irresponsible and it does upset me. The Government At the beginning I felt the Government were doing a pretty good job and made the right decisions -after all hindsight is a wonderful thing and I think that a lot of countries made mistakes at the beginning and these have been untested and untried situations. However as time has gone on my views have changed and we now seem to have a Government that constantly dithers, changes its mind and panders to the media and business over health.  I was very surprised by the Prime Minister’s first announcement about going back to work in May -it seemed almost cavalier and not thought through. I feel things should have opened up a lot more gradually and with a strict 2 meter rule. I do understand that the economy needs to be opened up in order to save jobs and save the country from going into recession -however, it feels at times as though the Government is just bowing to pressure from big business and the media and opening things up very quickly without any caution. It was a big mistake to say that people could drive to the beaches and beauty spots -why? When nothing was open -and this has nothing to do with the economy? It seems now as though the onus is on individuals to keep themselves safe and act in a responsible way -which doesn’t always happen.  People need rules in these situations. I think the biggest mistake the Government has made is its shameful treatment of Care Homes and the way they were thrown to the wind in the early part of the pandemic -quite shameful.    I also feel that the borders should have been shut and I don’t understand why people were allowed to still come into Britain even at the height of the lockdown. I think that after the Dominic Cummings affair a lot of people just decided that they would not listen to the Government any more and now they are carrying on as thought it is all over although it isn’t! The message is not always clear from the Government -for example I don’t understand why the wearing of masks in shops was not enforced from the start – I also don’t understand how you have to wear a mask for a fleeting interaction with strangers in a shop but not in an office where you have to be with the same people for up to 7 hours per day. The Govt say they are led by the Science but I am not so sure of this now and it seems increasingly clear that scientific views are divided on a lot of aspects relating to COVID. I have never had much time for Nicola Sturgeon  but I can honestly say that she has unexpectedly earned my respect during this situation and I feel she has handled things in Scotland so much better than the Govt in England. When she speaks she is clear, reasoned and always gives the rationale for decisions and why things are the way they are. She has shown exemplary leadership in my opinion. News I watched the 5pm Government press broadcasts on most days as I have been working at home. I did generally enjoy the broadcasts and found them very informative particularly the graphs and figures that were shown.  I enjoyed listening to the views of the Medical Officers and Scientists although as time went on I found that whichever politician was leading the broadcast became increasingly given to making big sweeping statements and tried to avoid answering some of the questions that were put to them about detail -which was very frustrating. I am sorry  though that now the regular broadcasts have ended that we aren’t getting the facts and figures that we were getting before in terms of the R number etc. One reason that I listened to the 5pm broadcasts was because a lot of the news that I saw on social media and my MSN newsfeed I felt was doubtful and often the opinion of one journalist rather than concrete news -so I felt it was better to listen to things directly from the Government and watch the BBC news. I don’t know of anyone who had difficulty in accessing the news but I do approve of having a BSL interpreter involved.  I’m not sure why the Scottish and Welsh briefings had this but the Downing Street briefings did not? Work and home life I have worked throughout lockdown although I have been working at home as the College has been closed since March.   My husband was furloughed until May when he returned to work. His workplace have done very well in making things safe. He drives to work so is not exposed to public transport. We do not have any children and I can understand what a challenge it must be to home School and keep them occupied whilst trying to work. Whilst there are advantages and disadvantages of working at home, on balance I can honestly say that I have not really enjoyed it.   There are some  obvious benefits to enjoy in that one does not have any travel expenses or journey to undertake, and on some days I have been more productive than I would be at work although at the same time there are other aspects of my work that are more difficult to do from home and I miss being with my colleagues as I am used to being in a big institution with a bustling atmosphere.  After my husband went back to work I  felt quite isolated at home and almost a slave to my computer.  It was ok at first but the novelty has worn off after it has gone on week after week.     I had always wondered what it would be like to work from home and now I know! I probably thought I would be able to do more things at home but it has not been the case and I have actually worked longer hours than I do at College and my husband has been surprised to see me working at 7pm regularly.  My job has also been somewhat stressful due to the way the assessments and exam results are being done and reported.  At the time of writing I am looking forward to my summer break although it will seem a little strange because I haven’t been working on site. The College buildings reopened in June but with very strict protocols on who has been able to access the building  The default position has been working at home for all unless people have to go in -this has mainly been for subjects where the students have had to go in to complete practical assessments. When we return from leave at the end of August the College is working towards a phased return as the Government guidance has changed again and students must be back in College for the new term.    The College do not want too many people in the building at the same time and courses will be delivered by blended learning – this is half on-line and half in person in the College. As I am in a non student facing role I am not in the first tranche of people going back to work full time on site and it is likely that for the autumn term our team will be doing a half and half model of working at home a couple of days per week but going in to College when we need to -this is quite appealing to me as I feel it is the best of both worlds -flexibility combined with going in on some days. It might be quite short lived however and the idea is that by Christmas, if there are no further outbreaks of COVID we will all be back on site -so I am looking at this as a way of easing myself back in and I’m lucky. I do feel that the working culture in this country may change as a result of the lockdown.  Many organisations are finding that their staff can work quite successfully and productively from home and the organization itself has less overheads.   The Govt now seem to want to encourage people back to working on site in their offices and buildings but they cannot force organisations to go back to the way they were.   This leaves questions as to what will happen to city centres and the businesses there that depend on commuters.   I feel the next 6 months will be interesting in this respect. If I’m honest, I feel as though the lockdown has taught me a lot about myself and has been a chance to almost clear my head.  I lost my Mum 18 months ago and I had cared for her.  It had taken up a lot of my life and I’ve been struggling since to find new purpose and new interests.  Lockdown has given me a lot of opportunities to step outside of my normal routine and think about the  things that are really important to me -I have tried to make the best of it and to reflect on my life and what I want to do and how I want to live my life. I feel I am now more appreciative of my home, my garden and small things. There are a lot of things we can live without in reality and I really feel we should all learn to lead a more simple life -life is going to be different for some time and it is a different year, so we need to accept that life has gone on hold but that it won’t be for ever.   I think there has been a lot of unintended consequences of the lockdown, one is this appreciation of the simple things in life which we have lost in recent times -I also feel that I have had a good chance to save some money as I haven’t been out much or had much in the way of expense. Technology I have had to very quickly embrace new forms of technology to be able to work effectively at home. I am now a proficient user of zoom for meetings and also for delivering training ­in fact I feel that I have lived on zoom!  I need to learn a bit more about Teams because I think we will use this at work going forward as we go into this blended half and half way of working -at least this is what we are going to be doing initially. I have also initiated my friends into using zoom and we have had several meet-ups with one of my best friends who lives in the north -the funny thing is that we could have been doing this sort of thing before -it is an excellent way of keeping in touch. I have always used WhatsApp as I do not use Facebook or any other social media -it is not encouraged by my workplace.    WhatsApp has been invaluable particularly to keep in touch with my work mates -I have a group of friends at work and we have been supporting each other, mainly through WhatsApp. I have really enjoyed discovering more about YouTube particularly for all my home work outs -I didn’t realize how much was out there.  I have also got to know more about my Fit Bit watch and what it can do for me in terms of tracking my steps, active minutes and exercise routines. I have also used some of the guided meditations. In general I have made more of an effort to keep in touch with friends and family members by text, phone and Whats App. Shopping and food I have loathed shopping since this all started.  The weekly shop has become a real chore and takes so long.  As I have shopped throughout in the usual supermarket that I always go to -I have taken to making a shopping list in the order of how things come in the store, it makes it a lot easier.   I gave up on online grocery shopping at the beginning when it was impossible to get a slot and I think it is right that slots are prioritised for the elderly and vulnerable.   We have bought a few things online that are non grocery related.   I haven’t ventured to many other shops since this started, only a chemist and a shop to buy Birthday cards.   We have a corner shop which is very convenient for quick shops and also some other local shops.   We have been to a farm shop a couple of times which we want to continue using.  In the beginning when there were shortages we just got used to buying what we could and making something with it -we always cook from scratch anyway. Entertainment and Leisure I made a commitment at the start of the lockdown that I would use it to get fit and I have carried this through.  Being cooped up inside with work  has made me want to get outside as much as possible at the weekends and do walking. I have also amazed myself by getting into an exercise routine and every single day since March I have exercised -either a workout, cardio, Pilates, weights etc.  I have never exercised like this in my life and I have felt this has been a unique opportunity to do so, that I will probably never get again.   It has been a bit of an experiment but I have so enjoyed it and to be honest it has kept me going and given me focus.  I knew that this year for health reasons I needed to get fitter and improve my cardio. I have to do low impact exercises because I have a bad back but it has been amazing and I feel so much fitter.  I know that what I am doing is unsustainable long term and the biggest thing I will miss when I return to working on site is being able to do my workouts every day but I feel I have learned so much about what works for me,I have tried lots of new things and I am no longer putting barriers in place between me and exercise.  As a result I will be able to make lasting changes -I know I will never go back to the way I was before -but I now know it is extremely difficult to do 10,000 steps per day! I also signed-up for two on line courses -one in Meditation and one about Qi Jong. Unfortunately I underestimated how much time I would be on the computer with my work so I haven’t necessarily done as much of these courses as I hoped to do, but I am going to go back to them during my impending summer break. We haven’t watched as much TV as I thought we would do as the weather has been nice for a lot of the time that we have been at home and we have been spending more time in the garden. We have made many more trips to Garden Centres this year!  Sometimes for something to do!   We watched all of the recent Dragon space ship launch and every week since the lockdown we have been doing a ‘virtual’ pub quiz which has been really good and something we would never have done before. We are used to entertaining and going out to eat and to the coast but I think we have adjusted well to not being able to do these things. I have discovered a lot of walks in my local area and I think we have started to enjoy the simple things without getting FOM (Fear of Missing Out).    We are going to start gradually getting out now.   I have met a couple of friends for socially distanced walks -including a celebration for the summer solstice. I enjoy celebrating the seasons of the year and it was challenging to have to do May Day on line but at the same time it was good to discover new things such as the English Heritage live streaming of the summer solstice. I have enjoyed discovering new (and cheap) things during the lockdown and I want to continue with a lot of these going forward but I am also looking forward to seeing more of my friends and going out more in the coming weeks and months -particularly to the coast now that things are opening up. Personal hygiene I don’t think that my personal hygiene habits have changed in any way except the ritual of washing my hands every time I come in from outside.   I also have hand gel available. Every time I go into a shop I clean my trolley and also use their sanitizer.     My husband finds it a bit more difficult to remember to wash his hands every time he comes in. I think once I start going to work on site and getting around a bit more I will make sure I carry some wipes and hand sanitizer with me -if I have to go on public transport I will probably wear gloves as well as a mask -but I haven’t had to do this yet.  I think it has changed my attitude to hygiene in general and the importance of this. We both had our hair done last week.  My friend is a hairdresser who works from home.  She has set things up really well.  Lots of hand sanitizer, disposable wipes and towels and masks.  I felt safe there but I feel sorry for her in that she now has extra expense and cannot do as many clients as she has to clean everything in between appointments Sleep I have actually slept better since the lockdown -and my fit bit watch can confirm this! I have tried to get up at normal time because the time I would be driving to work in the week I have been using for my exercise.   I have been quite tired in the evenings and I’m not sure whether it is because of spending longer on the computer or doing more exercise -maybe a but then again he didn’t have to get up early the next day to work!."

My health is very good as is that of my wife (79). We have adhered to the advice to stay at home for the past few months and have had no need to call on medical help. We feel frustrated if only because we are fit enough to lead active lives and would have liked to help others in our area if only to deliver shopping or make calls on those less able. As this is not possible or permissible we have occupied ourselves at home. We are particularly fortunate in that we have good health and are very fit. We have a garden which occupies us during the fine spring weather. The lock-down has suited me because I have been fully occupied and able to do things as and when I choose rather than be obliged to fulfil engagements and appointments. No longer a slave to the clock or the calendar, the pace of life has slowed radically, things are quieter generally and that suits me very well. NEWS I follow the news closely through my newspaper (The Guardian), BBC radio and television and Channel 4 News every evening. I also occasionally have ‘The New Statesman’ passed on to me. After the first one or two, I have not watched the 5pm Government press broadcasts. I soon tired of watching these as they simply appear to be much the same every day; statements of hope, vague intent and unfulfilled promises. The government defends its policy through being “guided by science”. Come the eventual enquiry I see the government’s defence of its mistakes (e.g. lateness to act, shortage of PPE etc.) being all down to having been “guided by science” – blame the boffins not us! WORK AND HOME LIFE As I am retired and very fortunate in my situation regarding health and home, the lockdown has affected me and my wife less than many others. I am only too aware of this and truly sympathise with those whose lives have been deeply affected. I admire all those who have had to work through this terrible time – NHS staff, postal workers, bin men, cleaners, care home staff, train and bus drivers and all the others. We don’t go outside and clap for the NHS but appreciate all health workers and would willingly pay higher tax for better remuneration of staff and a well financed NHS rather than people making donations as if it were a charity. Funding the NHS by donation and raising money through the public only enables the government to duck responsibility for its duty to fully fund the system as it should. The NHS is not a charity. TECHNOLOGY Technology and I do not get along. I don’t have a mobile phone nor am I into “apps”; I just don’t need such things. My wife has used Zoom to speak with friends and we have both spoken to our granddaughter using Facetime but my wife sets it up. I would never dream of using Facebook or Twitter. I have an ipad which I use a great deal plus a laptop which I use daily. I don’t feel that I’m losing out by not having many technological devices. SHOPPING AND FOOD Our son helps us by delivering groceries and recently we have arranged a slot at a supermarket to collect online orders. Our regular supermarket has instigated a well-run system and queues can be short. The shopping system has worked well for us as one order lasts for many days. My wife is a very good cook and enjoys preparing food although I would like to treat her to a few restaurant dinners. We eat well and our tastes and cooking habits have not changed since the lockdown. We have a wine merchant within a mile of us so I order online and collect by car. ENTERTAINMENT Our garden keeps us occupied outside, especially as we are having a fine spring. We enjoy gardening and I have recently installed a new wildlife pond, an exercise which has maintained my fitness. We take a walk most days and are fortunate in having several attractive paths close by. Although I no longer paint to exhibit and sell I do so for my own pleasure. I am an avid reader, non-fiction in particular, with a preference for history and biography. At the moment I’m reading a biography of Oscar Wilde. I have just finished a fine history about the loss of the ‘Titanic’ and a biography of Henry VIII’s final years. We are very selective in our choice of television programmes. We prefer arts, documentaries and discussion programmes rather than shows and soaps such as Coronation Street. We enjoy quizzes such as University Challenge and Mastermind. Our most regularly watched news programme is Channel 4 News. I don’t listen to much radio other than BBC News and Radio 3 which is as valuable to me as its TV equivalent BBC4. Music is vital in my life, both classical music and jazz. I have loved jazz since my youth and often give jazz presentations for my U3A group. My wife and I occasionally play Scrabble – on average once a week. I can’t remember when I was last bored or at a loss as to what to do. PERSONAL HYGIENE My hygiene habits have not changed at all since the lockdown apart from awareness that I should wash my hands more often. If I go into the public domain I wear gloves and wash hands as soon as I come home. SLEEP I sleep very well. It is something of a joke with my wife and me as I am able to fall asleep very easily. I have dreams but most times cannot recall them. The lockdown has not affected my sleeping habits. I tell friends that sleeping is one of my hobbies! CONCLUSION I’m well aware of how fortunate I am compared to so many who have suffered during the lockdown. What I have reported is the plain truth of my current situation and I’m keen to stress in no way do I gloat about my good luck. I’m only too aware of the plight of others; I would willingly help if I was allowed and have been frustrated to have been prevented due to my age. I’m a very fit 80 – in many ways fitter than some 20 years younger than me. I’m blessed with a wonderful wife to whom I’ve been married 58 years, without her I would be utterly lost. I expect and hope to survive the pandemic but will always think of those less fortunate, especially the families who lose loved ones. Like so many of my generation who have enjoyed the benefit of our health service I give thanks for all NHS workers and all those who have kept the rest of us safe. May 2020 ************************"

We have managed to stay fit and healthy (both physically and mentally) throughout the entire lockdown period. Emotionally we have been as usual, really. We have had occasional frustrations which have sparked small flares of tempers and bouts of grumbling but other than that we are getting on with our new lives and are remaining happy as we do so. I realise that this probably puts us in a very small minority, and we realise how lucky we are that we can carry on without any mental or physical impact. The Government I think that given that we are living in unprecedented times the Government is doing the best they can with the information that they are given - which is an ever changing outlook! Obviously they have made mistakes and can be guilty of not being as clear as they could be, but sometimes I think that the media and certainly the public can be just as obtuse when interpreting what has been said, meaning that much confusion reigns when it isn’t absolutely necessary. One thing I would have liked the Government to report on daily is the recovery rate in the UK, as this would be a positive light in the current darkness. Every other country is managing to do this, so why can’t we? Having listened to Boris speak yesterday (10th May) and whilst waiting for the 50 page document which will (hopefully) clarify what is coming over the next few months, I believe that they will try to stick to the “roadmap” as best as they can allowing for changes in the 5 criteria. Hopefully, they will be watching what is happening in Europe as they come out of their own lockdowns a few weeks ahead of us, and will use their data to help move us forward. News To be frank, I am not listening to most of the news that is out there as unfortunately there are so many conflicting reports it is hard to know what to believe. I look up the points that are relevant to me and what I need to know at the time (the infection rate and death rate for instance) and what will help me keep my business moving forward. As I am a key worker I have continued to go to the office to work so I am travelling home when the 5pm briefing is on TV. So I cannot really comment on whether they are useful or not! Work and Home Life As previously mentioned, I am still working. My work pattern has not changed, however the size of my team in the office has diminished as we have a number of office staff who can work from home during this lockdown. I am a Director for a Medical Devices company (we manufacture and supply laryngectomy and tracheostomy tubes and accessories) and our products are in great demand from the NHS at the moment so we are working flat out to maintain a good supply to them. This is good for our company, it means that it will continue to be strong during the pandemic, allowing us to keep all of our staff fully employed with no threat of the company failing or job losses. Prior to the pandemic my husband and I spent most of our time together at home quite happily. We don’t frequent pubs, clubs, restaurants or other such places. So we are carrying on pretty much in the same vein as before, with the notable exceptions that we are missing our families and our rugby league! Again, I am fully aware that by not having children, by continuing to work and by not having had to make massive changes to our home lives we are very lucky and in a minority of people who are not finding many challenges during this time. Technology I have always been a techy person so using technology to keep in touch isn’t something new to me. But I have found that I have been teaching a lot of people how to access and use technology so that they can benefit during lockdown. This has been both at home and work. At work we have taken to having Zoom meetings instead of face to face and the Teams app has been invaluable in keeping teams talking to each other. We have also been doing more WhatsApp video chatting too. They are all very useful tools, but nothing replaces face to face conversation. At home WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have been the most used apps for us. However, I did do a WhatsApp video call with my Mum to teach her how to download books on Kindle - that was a fun 30 minutes! :) Shopping and Food The main thing that we will take away from this lockdown is that we now love to shop at Aldi. Until this happened we rarely went in Aldi, but at the start of the lockdown they were the best stocked and most civilised place to shop in. We will not stop using them after all this is over. We have not gone without anything that we need as far as food and drink is concerned. We eat simply and have found that the things we buy on a weekly basis have been in good supply at all times. The biggest change to the shopping experience is having to queue outside the shop/supermarket so that they can have a minimal amount of customers in at any one time. I do not have an issue with this and wouldn’t mind if it carried on for some time. There is something to be said about being only one of 8 people in the supermarket and being able to get to the shelves to buy what you want without having to move a gaggle of chatting people out of the way first. Queue inside, queue outside - where’s the difference, it takes no longer and it is much safer this way. Okay, it might not be so much fun when the weather isn’t so nice, but even still… Entertainment and Leisure During lockdown we have continued to entertain ourselves the same way as we did prior. We spend our evenings chilling playing games on our tablets, reading, watching classic comedies on the TV and listening to music whilst just enjoying being in each other’s company. On a weekend, now that we have no other commitments we take long walks. We are lucky that we have some great nature walks close to us so it is easy to take a good 5-6 mile round walk without leaving our postcode. The only new entertainment is that we are trying to grow our own veg, this is a new project for us and so far so good. The carrots and lettuce look like they are ready to be planted outside any time soon! Personal Hygiene We have not changed any personal hygiene habits in the past 8 weeks or so. My husband has OCD and we have always observed good hand-washing routines and wiping supermarket foods down before putting them away, so the current government directives about hygiene change nothing for us. The only difference this lockdown has made to us is that I have had to cut my own hair (it’s pixie short and if allowed to grow will get thick and curly) - I’m actually getting quite good at it too. Sleep I have to be honest, because our routines have changed very little and because we are getting a good amount of exercise and fresh air out sleeping patterns have remained pretty much the same. We have suffered with neither insomnia or nightmares."

It is was it is, a pandemic whose future course and impact is unknown. We know that we are safe if we are at home and restrict our contact with other people. Unlike the UK masks, certainly locally masks are worn by everyone once they set foot outside the house, and if you don’t wear one you are soon told to wear one by another member of the public. If you are caught by the police not wearing a mask then you will get a £500 fine -no ifs, no buts. There is however a willingness to wear masks here as it is generally accepted that they keep you safe. The Government Although I live in Spain I have been following the government response to the coronavirus in the UK through the media. I have sympathy with all government leaders as they face a unique crisis whichtheir predecessors haven’tfaced. The decision to rely onscientific advice as the evidence base for decision making is the right one. However, if the coronavirus continues and the economy becomes badly effected then I think that will change. The government’s ultimate focus will be political and which response is likely to maintain their power base and support. As an economic downturn due to coronavirus restrictions will affect everyone, the coronavirus itself only affects those who catch it or have been affected by it from losing loved ones. I think the government will start ignoring the science if they believe that they they will garner more support by opening up the economy. I know it sounds cynical but politics is not an altruistic profession. News I tend use several UK news sources, the BBC news website, Reuters 24 news feed, and I can access Sky news live on the TV. In Spain I access the spanish daily El Pais online, the Valencian daily newspaper Levante EMC online and I get a weekly print copy of the european edition of Time Magazine and a weekly government electronic news bulletin from the Spanish Prime Minister’s Office . Usefully I can access all the front pages of UK daily newspapers on the BBC website. The UK press’s reporting of the coronavirus has been on the verge of hysterical, and seems predicated onscaring the living hell out of everyone. Headline:’Viruswillput 8 million Britons in hospital’ (Scottish Daily Express 16th March 2020) and then the small print, ‘up to eight million could be hospitalised’.  Or ‘Millions told to stay at home for at least 12 weeks’, (Daily Mail, 17th March) and the small print ‘Boris Johnson acknowledged that ‘drastic action’ was required…. however todays advice stopped short of defining explicitly who needs to stay at home’. Somewhat ironically, the Daily Mail having published that unsubstantiated headline on the front page then go on to criticise the government for giving contradictory advice on the restrictions being imposed! Likewise I have been unimpressed by the Government’s daily press conferences at 5pm as I have little confidence that what they are saying is true, they are ostensibly party political broadcasts trying to bolster support for the government. MO Number: W5965, Male, 55 years old, civil partnered, La Buitrera (Valencia, Spain), retired police officer Consequently I try to track down statistical information and interpret it alongside the headlines. I check the figures every morning using the rather good https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ which is updated daily and provides daily rates of infection and details for every country. I have neither had nor do I know anyone who has had problems accessing the news. However I have noticed the lack of a BSL interpreter at the UK Government briefings in contrast to the press briefings held by the Scottish Government and Welsh Assembly. This seems absolutely unfathomable to me that you would hold any governmental press conference without a BSL interpreter. By doing so you are denying or at least reducing easy access to information to one section of society. I can’t believe that anyone in the machinery of government in 2020 could have not foreseen this, especially after seeing the Scottish Government and Welsh Assembly responses. It is obviously a conscious decision by the government to disadvantage the deaf and hard of hearing. Work and Home Life The lockdown has had little impact on our home life. We are both retired and live off my occupational pension so work is not an issue. The lockdown hasn’t affected our home life only to the extent that we have had to modify our routines. So where are we might have gone food shopping every other day, the restriction require that we only food shop once week or less, so we have adapted to a food shop every two weeks. Likewise whereas we used to use 2 or 3 different supermarkets in he lockdown we have to use the supermarket nearest to our home. Although we have been unable to see our friends we have kept in contact by email and phone. None of this has affected us adversely, fact it has a positive impact in so far as we have been spending less money. Technology As we live in Spain we normally keep in touch with 3 sets of close friends by either FaceTime or IMO about once every one o two months and those continue. I keep in touch with other UK based friends via email. So it has been technology as normal for us. I don’t use a mobile phone or any social media. Shopping and Food Whilst in the UKthere have been shortages in the shops these haven’t been an issue where we live. The supermarket we use has restrictions on the number of items you can buy and this is enforced at the tills. The stores are clear to point out though that there is no shortage of any item and deliveries are normal. As their are restrictions on the number of people allowed in the supermarket there is now often a queue to get in, however conversely once inside the shop it is virtually empty, so the actual shopping and check out is quicker. These are what I would define as challenges though, just minor inconveniences to be expected due to the pandemic. Whilst we might eat with friends at weekends or go to a restaurant once a month or so, that has now stopped so we now pretty much eat at home. We have always home cooked so in that regard it hasn’t been a problem. MO Number: W5965, Male, 55 years old, civil partnered, La Buitrera (Valencia, Spain), retired police officer Entertainment and Leisure I am studying for a Master’s at Law with the Open University so I have continued with that as before. We haven’t taken up any new hobbies or games and our exercise has decreased as we are not allowed out for exercise as part of the Spanish lockdown. I had planned to repaint our upstairs outdoor terrace between visits from friends from the UK but as they have all cancelled their trips due to the virus I have much more time. So I have not only painted the upstairs terrace but also the front wall of the house as well. The only thing that prevented me going further was running out of paint, and our DIY shops are closed as they are deemed non essential. Other than that I have had more opportunity to read which I have taken advantage of. I have just finished Billy Connolly’s autobiography ‘Tall Tales and Wee Stories’which I enjoyed and made me chuckle. Having finished that I have moved onto, and am halfway through, a 700 page tome by Isaac Walterson, ‘Leonardo de Vinci -The Biography’. Our evenings are spent as before watching Netflix or Spanish TV. Personal Hygiene I have always been a fastidious hand washer although I have now adopted the recommended method so am probably more thorough than before. Otherwise, hygiene routine’s have been the same. I do now keep a large bottle of antiseptic gel in the car and bag of disposable gloves. Again gloves are mandatory when you go out in public but when I get back into the car I wash my hands with the antiseptic gel even if I am still wearing the gloves. Again this all seems very sensible to me due to the coronavirus and I am happy to follow the government’s advice. Sleep Since retiring I have always slept well, normally 8 hours a night solid sleep. This hasn’t changed as I am not anxious or worried about coronavirus, I know how I can catch it so I take precautions to avoid doing so. If I was use any emotion to describe my response to coronavirus it would be that I am ‘wary’ of catching the virus but confident that I won’t if I follow the guidance. I am a prolific dreamer, although once I wake up I can’t remember what they were about. Of the ones I do remember most are more abstract than interesting and none of those that I do remember have related to coronavirus."

Or anyone I live with. The only emotion I have experienced is frustration at not being able to get my hair or nails done or go to a coffee shop. The Government I think they have left a lot of things too late like allowing people to fly in from other countries, and not making sure that there was enough PPE for hospital staff, and carer's. I think in the next few weeks they will start to allow more retail premises to open. News I have not watched any of the Government daily broadcasts. I read the news online ( BBC News Daily Newspapers) I have not had any challenges with watching the news,and I was not aware of the petition regarding sign language, But I think it would be a good idea to have a news programme with this in it. Work and home life As my work is casual in the film/TV industry as is my husbands as well it means we have not been able to work at all. We do not qualify for any Government help so we are living off our savings, and my pension. Other than money everything has been fine no arguments or any discord. Because we don't work full time we are used to spending a lot of time together. Technology I have Zoom on my laptop and face time on my phone but never use either even before the pandemic I don't have any family, and friends tend to use text messaging/What's app/Facebook messenger to keep in touch. Or the landline. I have been getting more funny videos through What's app in the past couple of months though. I am quite experienced with technology so it's not a problem for me. I only use Facebook, a couple of times a day which hasn't changed. Most of my friends are on it so if we want to get in touch we use messenger. Shopping and Food I have been food shopping a bit less than normal as I hate all the queuing to get in to the supermarket so I try and buy enough food for 2/3 days when I go..In the beginning a lot of things that I usually buy like tinned soup,bread ,savoury crackers were out of stock but I just went to different shops, and bought different brands. I buy recycled toilet by the case online which lasts about 10 months so I never had to panic buy any. Entertainment and Leisure I have been doing a bit of gardening,cutting things back and planting flowers in pots. The rest of the time I play word games online on my iPhone and do paid surveys online some of which pay me via paypal, and others in shopping vouchers I.E. Amazon. My husband plays games on his play station so it suits both of us. Personal Hygiene My personal hygiene has changed in as much as I am not showering as often as I would normally due to not going out as much, I also don't bother to put any make up on especially if I am just going to the park to walk the dog. But I do still take care of my skin and always moisturise night and day. Sleep I have not had had any problems with my sleep."

I’m normally used to being out almost everyday). I’m fortunate not to have really experienced physical or mental health issues up to now, but I am constantly aware that as a so-called ‘vulnerable’ person, I do need to take care, so this, plus the fact that my husband is also at risk, does present as a ‘niggle’ at the back of my mind, even though I always seem to have a lot to do. My partner, a very empathetic man, and I have always talked things through, and I believe this must help promote a healthy mindset. I’ve tried to walk and do pilates exercises most days, even though I don’t like any sport or exercise really! As I suffer from arthritis with some pain, I’ve recently begun 1 to 1 pilates sessions via zoom with my usual teacher, and this helps enormously. I notice I would not bother my doctor during this period. I lost a large tooth filling, but obviously dentistry is out as well. (My cowardly side is quite pleased I can legitimately put this visit off! However, I also realise it’s probably not a good idea to neglect it, as I really can’t afford to lose the tooth). The Government I believe the government was very late in implementing preventative measures at the beginning which I consider indefensible. There was a lot of evidence from other countries beforehand to help inform decisions. Too late. I get the feeling that decisions are being made seemingly ‘on the hoof’ and lots of people feel confused by this. (eg Dominic Cummings. Enough said!) The bottom line for me is that I believe the government is trying to appease the money sector, putting lives needlessly at risk. Of course I understand the economy has to get back on to some sort of track, but conservative thinking always seems to favour stats and the economy , rather than care and people. I’m hoping the government will listen to the many people who feel we should be working at a slower pace towards the so-called new normal. News I always read the BBC updates online in the morning and also listen to Radio 4 news. We’ve stopped having a daily newspaper, though always have a Sunday paper. I’m usually preparing a meal around 5 so I listen again to the daily briefings on Radio 4. I felt quite upbeat in the beginning as I believed we were being asked to be proactive and it felt as though they understood what was happening. However, as time has gone on I’ve become more and more disgruntled at the speed with which we are meant to be resuming a more normal life. It feels as though they have to pull out a surprise at every briefing. After the Dominic Cummings debacle, it seems criticisms of the government’s handling of the Pandemic (and lack of transparency) are growing more and more. BSL Interpreters It doesn’t seem too much to ask, for interpreters to be provided (and maybe for the general news too). This Covid time can be particularly lonely and worrying for people, and this seems an easy and helpful step. Work and Home Life Because I’m retired, I don’t work, and the charity work obviously stopped. I do have friends who are having to adapt to new ways of working, which they’ve embraced, even though childcare at the same time is an issue. Homelife on the whole has hardly changed, though there does seem to be an emphasis on meal and snack times as a dividing up of the day spent in one place. Technology Although older, I don’t want to be left behind in the technology world and have been using computers for years. However, I don’t feel sufficiently interested to do more than I do now. I’m happy with a computer and more especially with my iPad. Since the lockdown, my wider family included my husband and myself on their Whatsapp . This initially made me feel included but I’m not sure about all the superficialities eg what cake someone’s baked this week! I much prefer a one to one phone conversation with them. I do have a Whatsapp group with my book club friends and this is fun. I can also keep up with a friend living in Italy. Unsurprisingly, I don’t bother with Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. They seem big timewasters, and again a bit superficial. I don’t want to react to incoming data, like a Pavlov dog. I have tried Zoom meetings with my book club, but these meetings were frustrating as the screen kept freezing. While it’s amusing to look at friends’ frozen grimaces for a little while, it does pall. However, two weeks ago I did begin one to one zooms with the Pilates teacher, which turned out to be very successful, and we’re continuing. Using the ‘phone has been a very good method of communication for me, and I’ve had contact with people I haven’t spoken to in years. Another bonus has been that talking with friends regularly has opened out into more general and personal topics, possibly as a phone conversation hasn’t got any visual distractions, and also we’ve not needed the ‘warm-up’ chat of where we’ve been, who we’ve seen etc because none of us have been anywhere or done much! Shopping and Food We have normally been lucky enough to have had most of our food delivered via online shopping, and I’ve always had ‘stock’ eg tins , a legacy from my mother who lived through the war and I also remember food rationing when I was a child. I’ve always needed to have food in, ‘just in case’. And for the first time in nearly fifty years’ marriage, this eventuality has happened!! I did venture out to the supermarket twice in two months, but I felt vulnerable. I used a mask and gloves which helped my confidence even if the jury’s out on whether they actually do much to stave off the virus. Having been to China last year, and seen the proliferation of mask-wearing, this seems a useful and normal practice to me. Cooking has been interesting and creative, which is good. I don’t normally throw food away in any case, but this experience has made me realise how reliant I was on fresh food bought frequently, rather than utilizing tinned goods for example. It’ll be interesting to see what will happen when we can just go shopping as and when we need. I’ve also continued to buy for food banks. Our resident’s association collects food locally every so often, with handing-in points in the area. Entertainment and Leisure As a retiree I already have lockdown lifestyle activities in place, like Sudoku, gardening, Word for Friends online etc. I used to go out every day for classes, meeting up with friends and generally being out, so now I do Duolingo French and Spanish every day. Also every day, I do some Pilates exercises which help with arthritis. I’ve never been an exercise junkie, but have forced myself to go for walks a bit more often (really to get out of the house).I did think I’d spend more time on cross stitch embroidery and reading, but haven’t done any sewing, and continue to read only half an hour before going to sleep. I completed ‘Where the Crawdads Sing’ last week but this week I’ve gone back to reading a Michael Connelly detective. At one time, I read all the Bosch novels, and Jo Nesbo too, as a relaxing read, so perhaps I’m doing this again now for the same reason. Although not particularly stressed, I do think underneath I have a level of anxiety and these detective books are my go-to staple relaxation. Life is usually worse in those novels than in reality! Watching TV is usually two hours, 8.00 to 10.00 and if we don’t like the set evening’s programmes, we fall back on recorded or I player programmes or Amazon Prime. Since lockdown we’ve watched the whole series of ‘Line of Duty’. We watch all the Arts programmes as my husband paints, and I’m interested. Grayson Perry’s lockdown Art club was really accessible and enjoyable. We enjoy plays and watched National Theatre productions too. We seem to have watched more programmes which make us laugh as well. We’ve gone back to Modern Family and Upstart Crow for example. Saturday night is usually filmnight! Radio 4 is what I listen to in the day, and although I know there are lots of very good podcasts, I don’t seem to have had the time to listen to them. I have been very surprised that I haven’t done or seen extra things, like my favourite, reading, which I really expected to do at the beginning. Personal Hygiene No change at all! Except I don’t put on my public made-up face every day. Sleep Sleep has been more difficult for my husband and me as we’ve got older, but at the beginning of Lockdown we both found getting what we felt was enough sleep even more difficult than usual. Although not feeling especially anxious in the day, I think I must have been internalising what was happening. The basic need of whether the food delivery was going to arrive played on my mind, and I had some very graphic dreams, like many other people. Some were about being back in the classroom, and I suppose were all about coping (or not), then and now. After two months, things have quietened mentally, though we can’t say we ever have a proper night’s sleep. But it doesn’t really matter in the broad scheme of things! ."

I don’t go out a lot other than for work, and I can be quite antisocial in some ways. My husband has been furloughed since the end of March and has enjoyed his time off -especially as he disliked his job and was looking to reduce his hours anyway. I think if one or other of us were more sociable, it would have been difficult as we were very isolated with no family nearby. I am still working through lockdown from home with one trip a week into the library, and I find that keeps me focused and content. The Government I think the furlough scheme has been a godsend to many companies -including where I work. Of our staff all but 4 are furloughed. I think some of the instructions about what constitutes an essential journey, going out and mask wearing for example have been somewhat confusing and for those people without access to the internet or a television, must have found it difficult to know what to do for the best. The government must be concerned about the amount of money it is laying out for furlough and the consequences of companies going out of business and the unemployment levels rising. I think they will have to start trying to ease the lockdown rules and try and convince the public that it is safe to go back out if you follow the strict guidelines. News Throughout lockdown, I have listened to the news bulletins and ministerial briefings at 5pm as I find that easier than reading the information in a newspaper. The briefings are the most useful part in my opinion, as the media ask the questions that I want to know the answers to. Also, in most cases it is mainly used to transmit information and not as political rabble rousing or point scoring exercise. I think there should be BSL interpreters. It seems a no brainier especially when we need everyone to know what they need to do to keep safe and protect themselves from the epidemic. I have to say that Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland are much better than the English ones. There’s no waffle. She is sympathetic but not condescending and answers questions well and without hesitation. I think the main facts should be given as bullet points and then elaborated on and then the bullet points reiterated at the end, because sometimes you get caught up in an issue and then miss the next point which may be relevant to you. Work and home life I have been working during lockdown, which I haven’t found onerous. A lot of my usual work cannot be done out of the library, but as the only member of my team who is working, Iockdown has meant that I have had overall responsibility for all the library services jobs and so have found it easy to keep busy. My employer is paying furloughed staff the 20% top up on their salaries which does seem to be causing resentment amongst the 4 of us who are continuing to work. I think it depends on how long we are in lockdown, but I would be happy to be furloughed, if my employer decided to swap the staff around. I have worked every day since the library closed on 21 March and would have liked a day or two off on holiday when the weather was nice. I know from speaking to my friends and family that a lot of firms are paying the 80% only, or furloughing staff for 3 weeks and then swapping around the teams. As a manager, I do have a sense of responsibility and a decent work ethic, but I do think “where’s the incentive?” when my colleagues are getting paid to sit at home. As I have mentioned before, my husband and I are self-sufficient and don’t socialise a great deal, so we have found lowdown easy. We are childless too, so we haven’t had to worry about home schooling. Early on in lockdown, we agreed we may start to get on each other’s nerves, so we have a code word which we can say to take the heat out of the situation. It does work as well because we picked a funny word -SAUSAGES -which takes away the seriousness, and thus the temper. The only issues I have had is my husband’s reluctance to do jobs around the home! When we both were working, we shared the housework and did jobs around the house and garden at the weekend and on an evening. Like all homes, there are a few DIY tasks that needed more time and effort, which I had hoped he would do now he was at home all day. Also, within a week or so of lockdown, he received a letter sent to all employees telling them that the company was struggling financially, and there may have to be redundancies. As my husband was looking to reduce his hours, he opted to take voluntary redundancy. I realised that he would probably have a few weeks of relaxing at home, and then start looking to do some of the outstanding jobs, but he didn’t! Weeks went by and he didn’t do anything! In addition, we used to share the housework, which suddenly with a few exceptions seemed to be all my responsibility. I never wanted to be a nagging wife, but I did make my feelings known -especially as I was working, albeit from home. After a few rows, we have reached a compromise, but I still feel I am doing the lion’s share. Technology Before lockdown, we did FaceTime on occasion with our family and I have used it at work occasionally. We joined an online quiz in March with my niece and her husband who live in southern England. Since then, we have been taking it in turns to produce a quiz on a Thursday night. It’s more of a social event -the quiz is the excuse, but it has been great fun! I feel closer to them than before. We have used FaceTime for that and occasionally Zoom if there is interference. My boss was keen that the staff stayed in touch via Zoom and WhatsApp. Unfortunately, one of my colleagues didn’t have an Android phone so couldn’t access WhatsApp and her internet was still on dial up, so she would freeze or disappear altogether mid conversation. To be honest, I found the work Zoom socials a bit awkward at times, as some on my colleagues just sat there and didn’t speak much or went to the other extreme and talked over everyone!! I think we have enjoyed seeing each other but find them a bit awkward or strained sometimes. I have used Facebook and Instagram about the same amount as usual but started a WhatsApp group with 3 others who used to be volunteers at the library. One of them is my best friend so it has been a way of keeping in touch with her as we haven’t been able to meet up. Shopping and food We have continued to visit the supermarket each week as we are lucky enough to have a car. We have been combining it with a weekly visit to check on the library and collect books to post out. We do have to queue to go in, but this is only for at the most, half an hour and the weather has been kind. We have noticed that most people are not wearing masks, and some are not obeying the direction of travel signage. Some items have limits on how many you can buy, and we have noticed empty shelves in some of the supermarkets with things like eggs, flour, pasta, rice unavailable. We haven’t shopped online for groceries, but my friends tell me that it is almost impossible to get a slot. We are eating well, as we have more time to prepare meals and we have both put weight on as we are much more sedentary. We are also drinking more alcohol. We used to have a drink 3-4 nights a week, but now it’s every night, although not to excess. Entertainment and Leisure At the beginning of lockdown, we decided to start going for walks. This lasted a few weeks, but gradually we have stopped (we use all sorts of excuses for not going out!). We watch lots of daytime television, which of course, we would never have done when we went out to work. Most of it is rubbish, but we sometimes have the BBC news channel on in the background. I have been knitting as I promised 2 young relatives a knitted sloth. Now I am making myself a wrap and have also promised to make a blanket for my niece. My husband has been making up some model planes, cars and suchlike. He had loads of kits and has three part done but doesn’t look to be finishing them any time soon. He has also done lots of reading and I have when the weather has been good enough at the weekend to sit out. As mentioned earlier, we have been taking part in Zoom quizzes. A Wednesday night one with my husband’s pub quiz companions and the other withfamily. Personal hygiene It would have been easy to slob about during lockdown, but we decided that we would shower every day and not fall in to too many bad habits! I would usually colour my hair as soon as my grey roots showed through, but I have only done it once since lockdown started. I will carry on as normal once I’m back at work I suppose. As I have long hair, I have been able to get away with not having it cut, but my husband looks like a yeti, as his hair was supposed to have been cut one week after lockdown! It has been nice not to have to put makeup on every day as I did when I worked outside. The one thing that we have embraced though, is wearing comfortable clothes around the house. I don’t like to sit about in pyjamas, but I’m more than happy to get my joggers on! Another change is that we are wearing clothes for a few days at a time, and not chucking them in the wash after one wear. Better for the environment and less housework too. Sleep I have been going to bed later than when I went out to work and had to be up at 5.45am. Now I get up between 7.30am and 8.30am if I’m working, and a bit later if I’m not. I usually sleep well and haven’t been troubled by nightmares or anxiety, but sometimes I wake up early and things I have to do for work go round in my head, and I can’t fall back asleep, but that’s not unusual for me."

SPRING DIRECTIVE 2020 PART TWO COVID 19 (UPDATE) This is in addition to my diary which has obviously covered a great deal of this over the last few months. I have been typing up extracts from the diary under the title Corona Virus, which will obviously be sent in at some stage. Health My husband and I have had no health issues regarding this situation. In many ways we have quite enjoyed it and it hasn’t really stressed us out. In the beginning we were a little fearful but that wore off. During the whole of this period we haven’t heard of anyone we know having this disease and so our initial anxiety faded away. We have enjoyed the peace and quiet, the extra exercise as we’ve walked more than usual, and we’ve not felt that we’ve been wasting time if we’ve just sat doing puzzles or playing board games, that doesn’t seem to matter now. We’ve also spent a lot of time in our garden and have enjoyed the fruits of our efforts. The Government Unlike many people I think the government have done a good job in the most impossible circumstances. It’s very easy withhindsight to saythis or that should have been done, but no-one knew how to deal with this situation, it was all guesswork and I doubt if any other group of people would have made a better job of it. I get fed up with the constant criticism being levelled at the government. None of us knows what steps the government will take in the future other than what they’ve already told us. The pubs, restaurants etc. are set to open next month as are hairdressers and they say schools will be back fully in September. I suspect the 2 metre rule will be reduced quite soon. I am writing this on 20th June, so everything could change by the time you get this. News I have watched the daily briefing every day, not all the way through but long enough to get the relevant information. Once they go to questions from the media I tend to walk away as their repetitive questions annoy me. So most of my information is coming from there, but we’ve subscribed to the Daily Mail on line for a couple of months and so I have been reading some of that eachdayand then there’s Radio 4 as well. I have had every confidence in the politicians and scientists holding the daily briefings. The two main scientists that have spoken, Chris Witty and Patrick (?), have filled me with confidence and I felt we were in safe hands. I don’t know anyone who’s had difficulty accessing the news, most people seem to watch the daily briefings. I believe there is a sign language version for those that want it. It’s important that everyone can access the information. Home Life Of course we don’t work and don’t have schoolage children so for usthere has been little change in our way of life. For the last 20 years we have done almost everything together, so no change there either. The biggest change to our life was the loss of our holidays. These are really the most important things in our life these days. To begin with when it was all up in the air and we didn’t know whether we could travel or not, it was very worrying but then the decision was taken out of our hands once flights were cancelled and so, although we bitterly regretted that loss, we were quite relaxed about it. Our only concern now is whether we will be able to go again in the future, at our age a year lost might mean we can never do it again. Technology I haven’t used Zoom. The only thing we have done like that hasn’t been entirely successful. We have had a Messenger group just of the family for a few years and the kids tried to connect with us using that. They’ve tried about three times and it usually finishes up with them full of giggles, all talking over each other and us not being able to understand a thing going on. Usually the sound quality, with 8 people on it, is so poor it’s really difficult to understand plus they will all talk over each other all the time. So while it has been nice to see them it seems a bit over rated. I think I enjoy more the mad conversations we have going back and forth on Messenger with the odd photo thrown in. Apart from that one Messenger group I don’t use social media at all. So, no I haven’t reconnected with people or kept up to date or escaped from events. Shopping and Food My shopping habits have definitely changed. Normally I do one big shop a week and then pop to a local shop during the week for odds and ends I’ve either forgotten or suddenly thought of, that now seemed impossible to do. I went to Tesco’s and there were so many things I couldn’t get, Ithen had to go to Morrison’s where I got more ofwhat Iwanted.This was actually before lockdown but when we were already getting warnings but once lockdown was in place I chose to go to Waitrose, not my normal Tesco, because they seemed to have a priority time for my age group. We went together as somehow I felt more vulnerable on my own, don’t know why. We didn’t find the queueing a particularly pleasant experience and we went round the shop very quickly and out again. At the start of lockdown I wanted to stay away from shops as much as possible, but I hadn’t been able to get a delivery slot. I got slightly annoyed that all the supermarket websites were telling me that they were prioritising the elderly and vulnerable, which the government were telling me that being in my70’s I fitted that category, and yet I still couldn’t get adelivery. So I had to go to a shop which was when I went to Waitrose. But then I managed to get a delivery from Iceland, a shop I rarely use, but I was surprised how good the quality was and impressed by the general way in which it was all delivered with courtesy. After that I managed to get several deliveries from Morrison’s and another from Iceland. I just kept going on the websites every day to see what there was available. We stayed away from all the big shops for a few months, frightened off by the long queues we saw at them all. We found that a little convenience store in the nearby town had a good range of things and rarely a queue so we used that for a Saturday paper and milk. We slowly learned that the best time to visit any shop was either very early or very late. So the last few weeks I’ve been back to the shops again but I’m going at about 7.30 am when it is very quiet. Because Costco don’t open early we found the best time to go in there was about 8pmjust before they close at 8.30.Theyhave horrendous queues outside allday. It’s lucky that we’ve had mostly dry weather during all this. Our eating and cooking habits haven’t really changed. Everyone seemed to be going mad on baking, hence my inability to buy flour and eggs for a long while, but I bake as a matter of course so I only needed what I always need. My only change really was I did a lot more meal planning so that I knew what food I needed to buy well into the future and I was trying to stock up for 10 to 12 days ahead. Entertainment and Leisure Our lives have not really changed massively. Our main hobby these days is geocaching and as that didn’t seemavery sensible thing to do we walked more. Usually a walk for us involves geocaching and we don’t really walk very far, but as we were just walking we did find we got a lot more exercise and usually walked between three and four miles a day. We explored lots of new areas near to home that we’d never been to before, so that was interesting. One of my other big interests in life is planning holidays and there wasn’t a lot of point doing that. We were due to go away at the end of April and I had started researching walks we could do, places we could visit and loading up geocaches onto the tablet. But that all stopped when it was obvious weweren’t going anywhere. At the beginning we did a lot of clearing out, tidying and cleaning. My husband did a lot of work in the garage, throwing out a lot of stuff and generally tidying it, he also did loads of workin the garden, things he’d meant to do for ages. My son told us that some Andrew Lloyd Webber shows were being put on line to view for free so we watched a few of those on the computer. We also discovered a game called GeoGuessr on the computer which we’ve enjoyed. It’s basically like Google Street View and you are dropped some random place in the world and you have to try to guess where you are. That’s been interesting and we’ve spent quite a bit of time doing that. I’ve spent a lot more time writing my Mass Obs diary too. I know there have been many comments from people about watching a lot more TV but we haven’t. In fact I don’t think there’s been any change in our viewing, listening or reading habits. We tend to share booksin the family and because we weren’t seeing anyof themwewere whittling down the large pile that we had to read and there were no new ones arriving. So I have started reading some of the more obscure books that I’ve had for years. But Istill onlyread when I go to bed and for no more than half an hour each night. Personal Hygiene Well, there’s been a lot more handwashing and it’s a lot more rigorous than normal. We have always used the hand gels when leaving the house but we’re using that much more frequently now and carrying it with usto use while we’re out. Other than that there have been no changes. Sleep I don’t recall any interesting dreams nor that I’m dreaming any more than normal. In the early stages of this pandemic we were both waking in the night, feeling fearful. But that wore off fairly quickly and I now sleep perfectly well. I have a good solid 8 hours, if not more, every night."

Apart from problems with my back my health has been the same as it usually is. I'm used to having a  massage once a  month so my back and shoulders ache.  Within a few days of our lockdown I bent over to picksomething up and my lower back seized up momentarily.  It was painful and stiff for a fewdays but I walked everyday which helped. Also I emailed my pilates teacher who suggested an exercise to help it That was rather an alarming time. Later one of my teeth felt as if it was loose and throbbed slightly. Again luckily it stopped after a couple of days. I have beengoing fora walk most days and also being doing pilates exercises. The classes have been available online. Emotionally I was most depressed about not seeing my partner who lives in England. Luckily the borders have now opened and he is able to get over. However the prospect of another spike in the autumn and winter is worrying. Initially, because I didn't realise how serious it could get, I		was annoyed that all my activities were cancelled. Especially as the over 65s were labelled as vulnerable so encouraged to isolate much earlier than the rest of the population. I'm quite an introvert so I can cope with my own company, especially as I live on my own and have learnt to deal with feelings of loneliness. I think I	was able to cope ok because the weather was good and I was able to watch the spring unfold on my daily walks. I quite liked the feeling of not having to get up and do things and I received more phone calls than I do normally. Luckily we never had a high amount of cases over here so I	wasn't that worried about myself or friends catching it which I am grateful for. I	did find after not going anywhere fora	few weeks that I was more nervous about driving and doing things I		haven't done for a	long time. The first time I went out in the car seemed very strange. The roads were much quieter and I almost felt as if I was doing something illegal as the lockdown was still on. It has been very unreal living through a situation that has never happened before. Mypartner was very frustrated at not being able to travel anywhere. I enjoyed not having sport on the media and no Jehovah's Witnesses calling.NewsI	read the Telegraph for my news. I watched the first emergency broadcast which was one evening but haven't really bothered with the daytime ones as it doesn't apply to us so much. Here on the Island we went into lockdown a couple of weeks before England so we have always been ahead. After being a bit slow starting up the leader of our local government and our health minister were having weekly media questionnaire broadcasts but these have stopped being so regular. I found that after a while I didn't really want too much news as it was just depressing and alarming and made me worry about things beyond my control. Chatting to a friend at the height of it all I remarked that we had never experienced hearing about such huge numbers of deaths. The largest I could remember was the 9/11 disasterwhich was 3,000 but thinking about the covid figures is so overwhelming you can't really take it in.TechnologyI only have a Nokia phone so was unable to use platforms available to Smartphones. I had Skype fixed up to communicate with my cousin in Canada but there were a lot of problems with it and I  found it very stressful so have given up on it. I'm not on any social mediaplatforms. While I probably missed out on things I suspect it also spared me a lot of the scare stories.Shopping and foodI have a  corner shop nearby so did a lot of my shopping there. Otherwise I  went to a farm shop which was also fairly close. Between the two of them I managed to get most of what I needed without too much queuing. I had stocked up fairly well beforehand. Also I  lost a  bitof weight not going to M & S for a couple of months and mainly cooking my own meals. I put off going to the main supermarkets for as long as possible.Entertainment and LeisureI	didn't take up any new hobbies or anything like that. Initially I rather idled about because my back was bad and got into the habit of watching Escape to the Country and did crosswords. I looked at websites especially one of a webcam of puffins in Alderney. After a while I	pulled myself together and did a bit more cleaning and tidying up of my house and cleared out few things and gardened. I typed up some wartime letters which my grandmother sent to my mother which was interesting. Looking back it seems like I didn't really achieve anything much and I've hardly done any painting however the days seemed to go byespecially if I went for a long walk and there was housework to do. One day I spent about 3 hours on the phone.Personal hygiene and sleepI		don't remember my sleep being affected much and if anything I had more baths as it was something to start the day off with."

Married, one daughter, 43, not living at home Spring directive 2020 Part 2: Covid 19 update. Health: We (I live with my husband of almost 52 years) feel ourselves very fortunate to be in our late seventies and still very fit. My husband had a heart attack about 14 years ago – given his weight, diet and active lifestyle it was ascribed purely to heredity and we had already been aware of that problem –but made an excellent recovery. He takes regular medication but every spray he has been given to be used in case of chest pain has gone back to the chemist, unused, when it is out of date. He has therefore had no health issues (so far). I, at about the start of lockdown, had a long-awaited telephone consultation with my GP as a follow­up to my annual check-up. My cholesterol level had fallen, but she prescribed a low dose statin “simply because your age has increased a previously small risk”, so I have been taking those tablets and, so far, none of the fearsome list of side effects in the small print has manifested itself. My temperomandibular disorder (a.k.a face-ache) kicked in mid-May for the first time in several years. Digging out the very effective exercises to ease it, Inoticed the rubric said it could be brought on bystress. Ididn’t feelstressed and the exercises worked after a couple of days as they usually do. Mentally, we are much the same as ever. I have been retired for 12 years, and my husband, after early retirement a.k.a redundancy on pension, has worked only part-time since 1993 so we are used to being at home together a lot of the time. We are normally quite busy, being volunteer vergers at our parish church for Sunday and midweek services and general dogsbodies there too; we help to run a folk song club, attend others and also attend a weekly dance club, where my husband is one of the regular callers. We have also, for some time, offered some support to our next door neighbour, 85, and, until his death just over a year ago, her husband too, in various practical ways (both are/were registered blind). We had decided to more or less self isolate before we were instructed to do so. At the start of lockdown, therefore, we relished the free time it offered, with not only no obligations but no possibility of anyone ringing up and saying, “Can you just...”We still feel that way. I am the worrier but the only thing that really got to me was food shopping, thoughI’ve always kept agood store cupboard... The Government: The Government was rather slow out of the starting gate on precautions, given the situation in Spain and Italy, but so little was –is – known about Covid 19 that they were flying blind to a certain extent. Public Health England did not seem to be on the ball either. As procurement, as a function of the NHS, had been handed to the upper echelons of that body some time before the crisis, initial blame for the lack of PPE supplies lay with their lack of forethought for such an eventuality but, when the Government apparently took over the task, the politicians seemed to lurch from one disaster to another, with faulty goods and mis-labelled consignments. Are they seeking compensation? We’ve heard nothing. The major oversight was having no women on the decision making body; so many ideas took no account of family problems and circumstances which, I feel, women would have recognised. The prompt and sensible acts came from the Chancellor’s speedy reaction to the economic effects of the crisis with furlough (a term I used to associate with missionaries who came to talk to us in Sunday School while “on furlough” from far-flung parts) for workers and help for businesses. That this has been slow in implementation in some cases is probably a function of the civil service machine, as that would have been overwhelmed by the tasks. -2­W633 Covid-19 update Being “guided bythe science” where there was no route map out of the pandemic sounded a good idea for those in charge, and they cannot be blamed for the quality, or lack of it, of that advice. Would anyone have known where it stood up or fell down? Shielding for the very vulnerable was sensible but the stay at home message was muddled for the fit elderly. In our case, we got as much delivered as we could, I have made three masked and gloved short 8a.m. supermarket trips since lockdown two months ago (including goods for our neighbour and my brother who lives alone and without transport) and we have taken a brisk walk every evening of between 1½ and three miles, carefully social distancing from the few we pass, for fresh air and exercise. Probably all against the “rules”. We would tell any politician who asked that the fit over 70s were probably no greater risk than the obese 50-somethings and they were not being told to stay in all the time (ageism is OK, fattism is not). I e­mailed our MP, asking him to ask Matt Hancock to clarify rules for the over 70s, after hearing many different opinions on the radio, but I have had no reply. Surely common sense would have told politicians that care homes, with elderly and frail residents, were placed at great risk and PPE and testing should have been a priority there. Now lockdownisbeing easedbuttheproblem, notofthepoliticians’making,is many of Joe Public ignoring the rules. Who will be blamed if there is a resurgence of the infection? The politicians, of course, for easing lockdown. I do feel that, given the lack of knowledge about Covid-19, whichever political party was in charge would have brought us to where we are now (late May) though we might have got there by different routes. What has appalled me is the needling and carping when, in a national crisis of this scale, all parties should be working together to find the best way out, not grandstanding at PMQs as if they were in a court of law or trying to further nationalistic ambitions by setting their own rules for easing lockdown. I don’t know what the Government willdo in the coming months and I amnot suretheyhave verydefinite ideas. The economy is going to be the major worry and I would hope for a major campaign to revive the retail sector as well as support for small businesses and start-ups as people try to get going again. [Since I wrote that, several days ago, the Dominic Cummings sideshow has rolled into town and sideshow is what it is; a chance for his enemies on both sides of the House to try to bring him down and it had no real bearing on breaching the pandemic rules. I have no views on his role as an adviser or on him as a person, apart from scruffiness indicating “take it or leave it” arrogance, but I am amazed that someone with his political nous could have thought he could get away with his trip North. I wonder who snitched. But someone was bound to. It may have been (just) within the rules but surely he realised that, once the news got out, as it inevitably would, he would do untold damage and the whole farrago would distract from the much more important task of dealing with Covid-19. As we regularly drive between County Durham and London, we would also criticise the wisdom, in any circumstance, of driving that distance, as he is said to have done, with no break. Going to Barney “to check his eyesight” was just plain stupid. Having done all that, if he had simply said that, as a father, he had acted on spur of the moment instinct, had later realised he was wrong and had apologised, it might have blown over, As it is, it is still (May 27) wasting newsprint. An amusing sidelight has been the tendency of media people to pronounce Barnard with the stress on the second syllable, which people sometimes do with names they want to make sound “posh”, and one MP called it “Castle B’nard” – well researched, Sir. Locals call it Barney anyway. -3­W633 Covid-19 update Update: June 2. Dominic Cummings’ father’s planning permission, or lack of it, for the cottagewhere his son stayed is now being questioned. Wonder who brought that up. Any stick will do... ] News: We take a national and a local daily paper, listen to the Today programme (until about 8am, when we have breakfast and turn with relief to Radio 3) and dip in and out of The World at One and PM and the six o’clock news on Radio 4. If we happen to be sitting in the living room, we might watch the local news on BBC1 (Look North) or the short bulletin after the 10’oclock BBC 1 news. At first, I listened to the daily Government Press call in the extended PM programme but eventually lost interest and so, before too long, did the PM programme. I have never watched it but, to be fair, I’m more of a reader and listener than a watcher anyway. I did feel the national Press had a very narrow agenda in their questions and these were far too long, packing several queries into one so that the Minister, or whoever, responding could not give a cogent answer (maybe that was the intention). I did notice, in the odd clip of Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings, that BSL was being used and thought it a good move. As I have a friend who has become profoundly deaf and relies on lip reading, I did notice which speakers might be bad to lip read as sub-titles are, of necessity, a précis. Work and home life: I am retired. My husband works on an occasional basis as an art gallery technician for the local council but that is on hold and he would not qualify for furlough. As I said at the start of this directive, we are used to being at home together and lockdown has neither affected nor challenged our relationship. Technology: We use the internet so little, just for e mail and the occasional search on a non-tracking search engine, that we have only a mobile phone dongle for connection. We have never interacted with any form of social media but have been in regular contact with friends and family via phone calls, texts, e mail and a flurry of proper, old-fashioned letters. A reply spoke of the joy of seeing a proper letter on the doormat. We have been pressured by others to join various events on Zoom and we did try but got a blue screen with the message “which e mail address do you wish to use?” and no option to click on other than “cancel”. Newspapers and the radio keep us as up to date as we wish to be and escape to us is to get lost in a book. Shopping and food: It’s always been a family joke that the shops could shut for a fortnight and we wouldn’t starve as I keep a good store cupboard and freezer. I also cook everything from scratch, including bread and cakes. Supermarket delivery slots were like hen’s teeth but I guessed we could survive, especially as we have doorstep milk and our butcher (meat, eggs, cheese, bread) linked with our greengrocer to add vegetables to his delivery service. Our daughter, in London, found her Tesco account would allow her to order for delivery to “elderly parents self-isolating” 250 miles away. All I needed to worry about was the lack of flour and fresh yeast –or, as it happened, dried. I have heard of over 70s in our town, not shielded people, getting a letter from Sainsbury’s offering them priority in getting delivery slots but I don’t know the basis for selection. Not us, in spite of being Nectar card holders and customers for decades. -4­W633 Covid-19 update I have made two trips to Morrison’s, our nearest large supermarket, masked and surgical gloved, for essentials for us, our next door neighbour and my brother H (71), who lives alone and managed to fall badly down his stairs so could not get out himself for almost a month. The social distancing arrangements were excellent. The two (so far) Tesco deliveries have also been very good and the latter one brought me three bags of plain bread flour and one of Granary – but no dried yeast. What I have is sadly out of date as it was bought “in case” and I always managed to get fresh. Year out of date dried yeast is perfectly OK! Baking powder was scarce but I managed to find a drum each for H and myself. I have managed to keep to our low fat, almost Mediterranean diet (owing to husband’s heredity tendency to high cholesterol) which I thought I might find difficult. The only change in our eating habits is that we consistently have our main meal at 1pminstead ofhaving it thenor inthe evening,depending onthe day’s commitments. Ifweeat at 1pm, we can have a good long walk in the evening and I don’t have to start cooking when we get back. One trip to Sainsbury’s, for own-brand water filter refills proved a waste, I had to get far more expensive Brita filters and for the rest, I could have gone to Morrison’s where socialdistancing was betterorganised. Entertainment and leisure: We have spent more time on our garden and tidying the shed and clearing what has silted up under the carport since our last two cars have been too wide to use it. Luckily, our local tip has reopened! We watch roughly the same amount of television – historical documentaries, anything on steam railways, repeats of Midsomer Murders. Sadly, all the quizzes have now finished and even Brain of Britain has had to go on hold. We read a lot anyway and I do cryptic crosswords while my husband does sudokus and code words. He has run out of his stock of whodunnits and, denied his usual source (charity shops), has gone to our bookshelves and is re-reading the whole of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. I am reading (it’s a long haul) VikramSeth’s A Suitable Boy downstairs and, in bed, I’ve read PD James’ Original Sin, Bertie, May and Mrs Fish by Xandra Bingley (a wartime memoir) and am now reading The World of Flora Thompson Revisited by Christine Bloxham. If lockdown isn’t eased very widely, I may finish the Seth and get on to The Mirror and the Light. I am missing my occasional dose of chick lit with attitude, e.g. Jill Mansell or Katie Fforde’s latest. Roll on the reopening of Waterstone’s (no independent shop here). We also read a national and a local newspaper every day and various magazines – The Dalesman, Good Housekeeping, Which? plus those from causes we support or organisations we belong to. Personal hygiene: Apart from rigorous hand washing when we come in from our daily walk or from one of our rare visits to a shop, our washing and showering habits are the same. My husband has had a beard for more than 50 years and, in lockdown, decided not to give it its regular trim“just to see what happens”. It is flourishing bushily. I had very dark hair which has gone sort of iron grey and the only colour that would mask it is black – flat and obviously dyed in my view – so I remain iron grey and, as I have long hair in an “updo”, which my husband trims when it gets just too long for tidiness, I am not troubled by the absence of a hairdresser. The loss of our chiropody appointments is much more important. -5­W633 Covid-19 update Sleep: Neither of us has lost any sleep. Our sleep patterns are the same as ever. My husband never remembers dreams. I dream vividly and, for some reason, often about being in an hotel or a self-catering holiday house/flat where various problems arise. Don’t know why. I do occasionally have uncannily prescient dreams, which I know will play out in the coming days, but I have not had any experience of these during lockdown. Sometimes, I wake in a state of apprehension from a dream I cannot remember at all, but this has not happened either. ends"

Next week on the 1st of JUne, outdoor markets and car showrooms will be alllowed to open and from the 15th of June all shops will be allowed to open. There is some debate whether schools, or atleast primary schools will open on the 1st of June, but a lot of parents and teachers are against this as it will be difficult to maintain safe distances between young children. There have been a few cases of hypocrisy among Government officials where they have flouted the very rules they have imposed on the general publicby travelling great distances themselves to see family when it was deemed unsafe to do so.NewsWe buy a daily newspaper but don't watch the television for news, we're not ignorant or complacent but don't need to saturate ourselves with it. We also see updates on our mobile phones­ national and local news. I think there should definitely be a sig sign language interpreter at the briefings and am surprised that there is only now a petition under way at this late stage.Work and home lifeMy partner and I are both retired but being restricted in our movements and things being closed or suspended for a while we are confined to home more that we normally would be. We moved just before lockdown, me to a place I've known all my life si I've returned to 'old' friends and family, which is a comfort even though we can't yet meet up as we used to.02.Q)M6787FemaleLiving with partner WimborneNot working now, but previously worked in shops, offices, garden centres, with horses.Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covidl9 (Update)TechnologyI keep in touch with family and friends by phone, email, text or on Facebook - in the first few weeks of lockdown I felt a need to ring up people I haven't spoken to in years, we usually keep in touch by email but you can't beat talking to each other on the phone, it feels more personal and spontaneous. Facebook I only us use for groups I belong to, a local one of my town past and present, and a couple of Nature and wildlife photography groups, they take you away from the real world as it is now.Shopping and FoodIn 'normal' times we would usually do a 'big shop' once a weeek or fortnight, going to either of the cheaper supermarkets. At the very beginning of the lockdown we went in one of the designated early morning slots for the vulnerable but found this to be a horrendous experience as, although there was 2 metre distancing outside the store, they were not limiting the number of people being let in so it was all crowded and people not keeping their distance at all.So since then we have just used local shops and supermarkets which are within easy walking distance of home. I think our eating/cooking habits are more or less the same, surprisingly we haven't been eating more unhealthy foods such as chocolate or crisps, but in moderation as usual.Entertainment and LeisureWe haven't taken up any new hobbies but probably increased the amount of time we spend on our current ones, whcih are drawing aa and painting in my partners' case, and writing and photographyin mine.My exercxise has definitely increased as I was bought a bicycle for my birthday and am out on it at least once a day. Walking to town is also a new activity which we do most days.I spent my 60th birthday in lockdown so it wasn't quite how I'd planned it to be, when I would've got together with friends and maybe had a picnic at a local park. My partner and I did drive ou out to a nearby village and walked and took photos. I will probab-ly have a belated 69th celebration with friends when it's possible.I took out 6 books from the library just before they had to closeand I've read 5 of them, ranging from Terry Wogan's writings Helen Lederer's novel, 2 murder mysteries and a true story inspired novel about a woman in America who refuses to move when a shopping mall is being built all round her.M6787FemaleLiving with partner WimborneNot working now, but previously worked in shops, offices, garden centres, with horsesSpring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covidl9 (Update)CONTD: Entertainment and LeisureAs usual I've been listening to Radio 4 Extra, which is a mixture of drama and classic and new comedy. I thought I would use the opportunity of lockdown to watch or re-watch DVD's that I have - comedies and countryside ones - but this hasn't happened - yet.Television has been the usual things I'd watch,- 'Sewing Bee', 'Great British Menu8 ', 'Grayson Perry's Art Club', 'QI’ but as usual I can take it or leave it, I'd rather be outside if it's fine enough.Personal HygieneWHere we live now, having moved here in early March, we have a much better shower, so it is a pleasure to use it. Like most people my hair is growing like mad and well past its usual cutting date - it was last cut in December, so I'm  longing to get it done. I bought some big hair clips so I can make a short pony tail or clip it back at the sides. The warm weather doesn't help !SleepI never sleep much at the best of times, so at the beginning of lockdown I found it very hard to get to sleep and if I did would keep waking up. This has luckily diminished, maybe helped by the increase in exercise I'm having. If I can't sleep I'll put my earphones in and listen to the radio until I drop off. Or I'll ge get up and make a milky drink and read until I'm tired."

I went on a Canary CRuise to get out of not going to a hotel for Christmas with my daughter, her boy friend & friends. I had been the previous Xmas and it was fine but I did NOT want to repeat it or offend her so I used the CRuise as an excuse. Also, because I never learned to drive, I choose the Cruise Co. Saga who send a chauffeur to collect and take me back.It was the 2nd night, one of the 3 when we had to wear evening dress so I flung all 3 on the bed (as you do) & after using one left the others until I got back – which did NOT happen – I knew that 3 girls called “The Opera Girls” were singing Arias so I went straight from dinner to the concert hall to hear them & they finished about 11pm but one of the guests sitting at the dinner table had also W1835come to said another singer was coming to the club so instead of returning to my cabin I went to the club. It was full & I spotted an empty chair and headed for it – But because I was so intent on getting to the empty chair I had not noticed the protruding leg of the chair in front and the toe of my (L) shoe caught on it throwing me forward. Of course several people came to help but I said “No I can manage” doing pilates one is always on the floor. But as I turned, the pain came. It all happened so quickly – I was on a wheel chair being wheeled to the hosp. with ‘Romeo’ clutching my (L) shoe & handbag. I felt Like Cinderella until I was greeted by a sleepy Doctor, wakened up, who growled to the two nurses “put her to bed, Catheterize her to give her morphine. “Romeo” was all for staying – I think he planned on singing to me – but thank God the nurses would not allow him any further. I fell asleep & woke to see a figure approaching – IT was 4am. I must have jumped because he said “I’m just checking you are O.K. IT was the ships doctor from Montenegro, One nurse was from Serbia & the other South African. They Xrayed me which confirmed a fractureW1830I was there for 2 days till we reached the first bit if land which was Maderia. Meantime ‘Romeo’ had been calling 6 times a day & the Serbian nurse would say “your suitor has been again”. I had told them not to let him in so they told him that “only family were allowed”. I think it was the source of much amusement to the DR. & nurses that this (me) bedraggled creature was eliciting such devotion. This is the reason I never go on solo hols. because I don’t want to meet ‘a suitor’ I was very happily married & would always be making comparisons. He had asked me at dinner in front of 8 people how old I was – I said I was not telling him whereupon he replied “It doesn’t matter because I already think you’re Lovely”. His wife had died 18 months ago. The whole table was entertained esp. when he invited me to his home I really wanted to thank him for his help but was afraid to use my mobile because he would know the Tel. No. It’s taught me a lesson to be more distant – my husband used to say that men could misinterpret my friendliness. So the fall was a mercy. and saved me 10 more days of persecution.W1835Arrived at Funchal where an ambulance was waiting to take me to the “Hospital Da Lux” they were all speaking Portuguese and I have not one word.the  surgeon spoke English & asked my weight (for the anaesthethic) – well because I am on statins I am checked once a year at my G. P. clinic I was 58 kilos – 50 – the 8 was in my head and I told them I was 80 kilos. there was silence till the surgeon sad “I think you’ve left some on the ship the ship had gone on to the other islands. I had never returned to my cabin. but saga staff packed and folded everything carefully, jewellery money etc. and all were sent by D. H. L. to my home address securely sealed. The food was simply delicious – 3 cooked meals & afternoon tea with the Portuguese pasta de Nata pastriesThe nurses “bed showered” & washed my hair. BRuno, the physio was a saintThe port medical agent [Duno] had gone to university in England so spoke English visited every day. Dr Pedro the surgeon teased me about wanting a new hip so I decided to fall near beautiful Maderia. He’d been in Dublin on holiday the previous year. One nurse greeted me every morning W1835with ‘Hello, my darling’ that was the extent of her English but when I was leaving even though she was on another unit came & said “May I hug you” goodbye Dr Pedro, Bruno & [Duno] all saw me OFF with kisses on both cheeks. I am not a good patient because I moan if anything hurts – so I bet they were relieved to see the back of me I wanted to give the nurses & assistant nurses some chocolates so [Duno] went shopping for me & even wrote messages on slips of paper & stuck them on the chocs.The most amazing thing of all was my Nationwide Travel Insurance they phoned me every day to chat. They sent a nurse to accompany me home & booked a business class flight to Gatwick with champagne and Returned the cost of my lost holiday. I was telling the nurse about ‘Romeo’ & she said lots of “senior” men take Viagra & their wives were leaving them unable to cope. We arrived home at 1am & the driver did not even have a drink of tea. The nurse was going on to Wales. So I just got home before Covid shut DOWN!P.S.Apropos of the reaction to pain – I think I told you before that in Labour the English are the best & quietest patients, the Irish are the worst with the [?] – All the saints are called on in LOUD VOICES – the West Indians quietly say Jesu, Take this thing out of my belly! I’d be no good as a spy.W1835The Summer Directive Part IAs I said in the introduction I got back from Maderia in time before “shut down” the first couple of weeks were filled with people coming to see me & wanting to hear all about me tripping & sustaining a fracture (and I wasn’t even drunk)March 17ththen one of the ladies reached 90 and had a part in the Golf Club. The band did not turn up because people were beginning to be “careful” but one of those present had a guitar so played I and I was able to dance on my new hip. 14 people did not come & the Club charged PAT, whose birthday it was, for them, including the champagne which we thought mean.The next thing was my trip to Venice and 3 operas in May was cancelled because enough people did not book & “Travel for the Arts”, the company, refunded my deposit when they cancelledAll the shops in the town offered to deliver and the council sent an A4 page of their phone NOS.People continued to visit me but sat in the garden so I brought up a table, parasol & chairs from the cellar.Of course I don’t ask the shops to deliver (except Freshpak who deliver the Kenyan coffee & Assam tea) so I go out.I was slotted in for follow-up checks post op. here and they Xrayed me and saw that I had a cyst on the other hip – it was not bothering then but as time went by it did become painful. I could not go for my usual walks & needed a crutch to just walk for 10 mins.By this time ‘shut down’ had arrived the G. P was doing no referrals & their was a growing back-log in the hospital clinics. I got to the stage where I was not standing I lay on the settee/sofa because my (L) hip hurt if I sat on it – the phone went non-stop &calls from Ireland usually last an hour – so one day 4 hours had gone before I knew it. they were only enquiring about how I was coping with Covid – I did not tell them about the hip & wont till its all over.W1835Because my son’s in China & daughter lives in Italy most of the time, nieces in England phone & one arrived to see me in a camper van which she hired because she would not sleep in the house in case she gave me Covid by chance.The most annoying thing for me is that shops prefer CARDS to cash & I cannot get used to using a card for small amounts and the other change is that I’v become quite lazy & watch old restored films in black & white & [DUB’s] of operas.Some people who called said they knew I was at home because they head the music! I leave the kitchen door ajar & one day I heard a voice calling – so I shouted “come in they called again so I went to see – it was a couple I’d met in Bulgaria a couple of yrs ago, but they would not come in nor have a drink in the garden – so just chatted the other side of the door – I have a half door in the kitchen. The top half has the kind of glass you can see out of but those outside just see a mirror and get a shock when they see themselves. I have it to allow me to watch the birds feeding without disturbing them.Then a miracle happened – The consultant from the Fracture clinic – who took blood to see if there was any infection in the bony cyst, wrote saying there was none but gave me an app. for July. I was so demented by this stage I told him I was willing to pay (although against my principles) whereupon he told me he did not do private patients – for which I admire him He said he would certainly operate but not sure when because of the back-log. So imagine by delight when I got an app for Sept 29th I’v had all the pre-op tests but the ECG showed my heart was racing (Tackycardia) Last week. It will be the electrics & I’ll probably go on beta-blockers but I’ve heard nothing yet – my only hope is that it does not prevent my hip op.Back to Covid! When out shopping we all kept 2 metres apart the street was marked & we went one way going up & returned the other side. Only 2 people went W1835into the shop at once, but unfortunately we began getting lots of visitors who stand around in groups at shop doors – and one has to go in the street to get past them. We all wear masks now. What has Covid done to me?1) Apart from my hip I couldn’t go anywhere, but it did not matter – I dealt with a lot of clutter – did I bin it – NO just moved it somewhere else because it was all too interesting.Friends send books (the house is already full of them). In the house I found Virginia Wolfe, Penelope Fitzgerald.My sleep is back to normal. When my husband died (5 yrs ago) It was disturbed & I slept for only 3-4 hrs a night & as a result felt tired. I’m back to 6 or 7 of really sound sleep now.I haven’t had “spare time” because although visiting has been reduced, people phone, & hours disappear.I am just longing to visit my favourite cities1) London where I lived for 25 yrs2) Dublin (and home in the country)3) Venice (which I love in snow rain, floods & mist.), My husband & I both loved it & visited 26 times and walked & walked to find Artists work in the churches We were going on Easter Monday but he died on the Easter Sunday. I’v been back on my own.Oh yes, I nearly forgot the sky was bluer - & this reflected on the seaIt was lovely to walk through an empty town after 5pm,I’v had to buy sonic alarms because the mice were eating the books on the lower shelves & I was told they would nibble electric wires. Where is that coffee?"

Mass-Observer W6757 describes themself as female; age 49; married; chartered accountant.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Married London Chartered Accountant Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing First five words that come to me when thinking of ‘a healthy body’: Slim, glowing, flexible, strong, smiling. I’m thinking of someone like Adriene Mischler, the online yoga teacher. A beautiful healthy young woman who also seems kind, grounded and spiritual, so in a good place mentally as well as physically. I visualise her doing yoga, indoors (this is how I’ve seen her, as I’ve followed some of her videos). I suppose my health and wellbeing has been affected by the fact I am a woman, and by my social class. Being a woman means I’ve had periods, I’m subject to hormone cycles, I’ve had to deal with contraception, I’ve had fertility treatment, two miscarriages, gave birth, breastfed my child. I’m in my late forties so the menopause is starting to show itself. These have all had effects on my health. Being middle class and comfortable financially has probably contributed to not having any major ongoing health issues. I’ve been able to access private healthcare when I’ve wanted to. I first became really aware of health in my thirties I think. I did join a gym in my late twenties but that was more because it looked fun and luxurious than because I was really serious about being healthy. I remember in my thirties noticing that my cohort of friends were all becoming more sensible, drinking less, going out less. It was probably a mixture of people focusing on their careers more and just generally growing up and priorities shifting. Most of my friends had some kind of physical hobby that they did regularly -weight training, running, tai chi, swimming. I joined a gym for the first time in around 1999 but only started to get really into it in 2003. I used to go to classes four times a week, I was addicted and loved it. In 2008 I had to give up the gym as my schedule changed and I couldn’t get there often enough to justify the expense, but I started dancing Five Rhythms and doing Bikram Yoga instead. Then in around 2011 I started seeing a personal trainer once a week, we only stopped last year. We used to do weight training and HIIT, I really enjoyed it. Last summer I did Couch to 10K and now I run around twice a week, including a 10K most Sundays. I’m experimenting with various online yoga and weight training options, I haven’t quite found the right one yet. And I still dance when I can. I really enjoy exercise if it’s the sort of thing I like, I fantasise about fitting more exercise into my life. I was never sporty at school and don’t really identify as a sporty or healthy person so I’m pleased that I’ve found some exercise that works for me nevertheless. I’m very keen for my son to enjoy some kind of physical activity, I’ve paid for him to try ballet, tap, judo and fencing as well as his school sports. I want him to have a sport that is ‘his’ if it turns out he doesn’t like school team sports, as was the case for me. Now that I’m getting older, and am a parent of a young child, health seems much more important. I worry about it a lot more than I used to. I had a cancer scare when my son was two years old and even though it was a very treatable kind of cancer (and I didn’t have it anyway in the end) it was so frightening to think I might die and leave my child. But I am overweight and don’t do enough about that. It is hard when you are part of a family and eat as a family and don’t have full control over what you eat, really. My husband does most of the cooking, which I’m very grateful for, but it means I feel I should accept what he makes for us. We are a bit of a bad influence on each other. And I like eating puddings and cakes. Married London Chartered Accountant I gave up drinking when I was pregnant with my son and never started again. For a long time this was because I was breastfeeding, but even when that stopped, I didn’t start. I felt so ambivalent about it. I missed drinking a little bit, but didn’t want to go back to my old ways of drinking too much, I would often drink a bottle of wine in one evening. I didn’t have faith I could drink moderately, and I don’t like the idea of not being my normal self around my child, because I’m drunk or hungover. So I still don’t drink and it’s been seven years now. It helps that my husband doesn’t drink either, so I’m not tempted at home. You can get some really good non-alcoholic beers and wines now and I drink those when I fancy something. I first became aware of ‘well being’ fairly recently. It’s obviously become a massive trend in the last few years. There were lots of cookbooks about healthy eating, yoga was really popular, athletic clothes were fashionable. One of my favourite clothes retailers is Sweaty Betty, for a long time I only used to wear their stuff when exercising, but since my son has been born I wear their stuff a lot more, still when exercising but also the rest of the time too. It’s so comfortable and stylish. I’m also thinking of things like the Goop website and Instagram, neither of which I’ve looked at, but you hear about them anyway. Wellbeing seems to be something that really appeals to women in particular and is marketed at us. Of course it’s good to be healthy and to try to be happy, but I do suspect it’s also missing the point a bit. Women who are stressed out or exhausted, looking after everyone else, do need to take a bit of time to take care of themselves but also need the external stress to be alleviated, or wellbeing is just another thing to worry about and feel guilty about. I feel bad because I ‘should’ be meditating and doing yoga and exercising and I can’t fit it all in. I don’t really remember my parents talking to me about health. We ate healthily, but it all felt quite spartan. I remember every year we used to go on holiday, self-catering in the UK, and for that two weeks my sister and I were allowed to eat junk food -I remember buying milkshake syrup, flavoured rice, angel delight, those little mini boxes of cereal. It was a real treat as we never ate this kind of food the rest of the time. I didn’t go to a fast food restaurant until I was an adult. I remember only starting to go to coffee shops as a young woman -we never used to stop for a coffee while out shopping when I was growing up. We only had fizzy drinks at Christmas. An ice cream was a special occasion. I had to ask permission to eat a biscuit. Mum used to bake cake but it was very basic fruit cake. My Nana used to bring little mini trifles for us when she visited every fortnight. Food at home generally wasn’t that nice and I think it’s caused me to be too self-indulgent as an adult, now that I can eat what I like. Growing up I was thin, because I didn’t eat for pleasure. Even now I dislike my mum’s slightly joyless food tendencies. In particular, after a meal she’ll announce ‘fresh fruit’ as a pudding and then cut up and eat an apple or orange while everyone sits and watches her. It annoys me, I don’t think an apple is pudding! I would certainly never offer one to a guest as part of a meal -I’d make or buy something special. I particularly remember my mum going through a phase of making me and my sister drink a milkshake every day made with cocoa powder with a raw egg mixed into it. The combination used to make the milkshakes go grey and they really weren’t nice. One day I had a moment of revolt and poured my milkshake over my sister’s head. It wasn’t intended as an attack on Married London Chartered Accountant my sister, just general rebellion against the milkshakes. As far as I can remember I got away with it without getting into too much trouble, everyone was just so surprised. Sometimes now I eat something very delicious and healthy and my whole body kind of purrs, there’s a wonderful sense of nourishment and satisfaction. So I know it is possible to get pleasure from really healthy food but I don’t really know how to reproduce it -or generally make the effort to find out. Nobody talked about the importance of exercise when I was young. We did dancing lessons but that was just another activity, like brownies. PE at school was just the standard sports, like netball. I’m actually really pleased that as an adult I’ve managed to reinvent myself as someone who does really enjoy some types of exercise. Nobody talked about mental health. -in particular, everyday mental health, people who aren’t actually mentally ill but still suffering mental distress in some way. That’s everywhere now but feels new. The only mention of health I remember at school was being taught about periods in a special session at junior school. They separated the boys and the girls, and the girls had a talk from a woman. All I remember about that was her putting a tampon in a glass of water to show us how it worked! We had the usual PE lessons but it was just another part of the school day, I don’t remember anyone talking about the importance of being healthy. My sister (a year younger than me) had her first period before me. I remember her coming home from school in quite a tense mood and speaking to my mum and going into the downstairs toilet, which we didn’t really use. I anxiously asked my mum if I could see, and she held out my sister’s bloody pants, a bit nonplussed. It looked quite alarming. My mum was very supportive when I started my periods. I was finding it hard to deal with the discomfort and she was fine with me taking painkillers. She was happy to buy every kind of sanitary towel and tampon for me until I’d found the ones I liked best. I was dismayed at the prospect of going on like this until I was middle aged, but I got used to it. My mum wasn’t so good on other aspects of puberty. I remember wanting a bra and some deodorant (possibly earlier than I actually needed them, but I wanted to be prepared) and finding it hard to mention to her, worrying that she’d say ‘no’ or be cross with me. I think she found it a bit hard to see me growing up. I remember wearing some dungarees a lot, I must have been no older than 11, then pulling them out to wear again the following summer and my mum giving me a big hug and saying ‘oh my little girl!”, as if I’d changed in the intervening year and she didn’t like the new version of me so much. She never guided me with things like shaving or make up, although she did both herself. I always felt unskilled and awkward with these things, and still do. I remember my first pubic hair growing and thinking it was a loose hair and trying to brush it away before realising it was part of me. Married London Chartered Accountant I’ve always been quite happy with my body though. Even though I know I have flaws, like everyone, I’m fundamentally content. It’s really helped that I’ve never had anyone in my life who tried to criticise my appearance (even though I only have normal looks). My parents never commented on it, they were more focused on how well I did at school and how well behaved I was. None of my lovers have dared, some of them turned out to be abusive but I think they must have guessed I wouldn’t have stood for that. It’s funny how some criticism can really wound and other things just bounce off and are laughable. Now, in my late forties, I feel slightly anxious about my health. I worry about the menopause and how bad that will be. I feel like it’s already starting. I’ve put on quite a lot of weight in the last couple of years which I don’t think is entirely down to my eating habits. I have difficulty sleeping when I used to fall asleep pretty much as soon as I went to bed, I used to joke that I could go to sleep whenever I wanted to, and how useful it was when I was stuck somewhere and feeling bored. I’ve pretty much lost interest in sex. I feel quite glum and withdrawn a lot of the time and I wonder if that’s hormonal. My skin isn’t as clear as it used to be -people often used to say I looked young for my age, but that definitely isn’t the case now. Because my son is young it seems extra important to stay healthy and alive, so that I am here for him. I take a range of vitamin supplements (feeling slightly ashamed and judged as a gullible woman by my husband, even though he hasn’t shown any negativity towards me -I’m projecting). I do a long run (10K) most weeks. I dance when my dancing events are on. I periodically do yoga and meditate although not with any consistency -it’s so hard to fit in around the family and work. My diet isn’t great, I have fairly healthy breakfasts and lunches (at the moment, overnight oats and an egg with lentils or avocado, or a big salad) but eat a lot of snacks, puddings and carb-heavy dinners. I don’t drink alcohol at all, or smoke, though. There are no health or beauty products that I couldn’t live without, but I’d very much miss face moisturiser and hair conditioner. I have a lovely face oil too which I put on top of my moisturiser at night. I like luxurious bath products like bath oil and scrubs. I use soap instead of shower gel after reading that it keeps you cleaner (also it’s more environmentally friendly of course). I often use body moisturiser. A couple of years ago, feeling my age, I started spending more on skin care so now I sometimes use exfoliators, serums and masks. I have a Beauty Pie subscription and do enjoy browsing that website -I went a bit mad when I first joined and got quite a lot of stuff but now just buy the odd nice t thing. It seems simpler buying everything from one website, which the subscription encourages you to do. I don’t wear make up, about 50/50 because I never really have, and my husband doesn’t like it. I don’t mean that he’s controlling me but it seems a bit pointless to do something to supposedly make you more attractive that actually makes you less attractive. It is nice that he likes me as I am! I used to get my hair coloured, eyebrows shaped and tinted and a gel manicure every time I went to the hairdresser, 3 or 4 times a year. I loved the way it looked, but it was so expensive, over £150 a time. Just before Covid hit, my hairdresser moved back to Spain Married London Chartered Accountant where he was from, originally. I’d been seeing him for 20 years so it was daunting finding someone new. Then we had the lockdowns so currently I haven’t my hair done for 16 months and am letting the grey come through. A bit of me would like to go back to my old look but the cost is off-putting and I feel very middle aged and that I can’t hide the ageing and might as well embrace it. I don’t really care, it’s so annoying that middle aged women become invisible but also that’s how I feel, invisible, not interested in catching people’s attention any more. I think my cancer scare a few years ago was a bit of a watershed for me. Until then I hadn’t had any particular health issues apart from the small things that affect everybody. Now I have the history of having had the fear of cancer, and having an operation (they thought it might be thyroid cancer and removed half my thyroid). In a small way it’s hard to accept, I don’t want to admit to myself that something went wrong with my body. My parents (79 and 80) are very well considering their age, so I have a tendency to assume I will be too, and I have to remind myself it’s not guaranteed. I have a baseline of liking and respect for my body. I would never feel dislike of my body, that would be really foreign to me. I do notice that I’m overweight, my hair is going grey, my skin is less radiant than it used to be. But I’m not remotely interested in attracting strangers, my husband loves me anyway, so my main feeling is that I wish I looked less ‘round’ in clothes, and could fit into clothes in smaller sizes, so that I could buy clothes from shops I really like but am too big for (I’m size 18). I don’t mind getting older -I have actually always found older women attractive. I hope to be more fit and healthy when I’m older. I’m definitely less flexible than I used to be. I need to find the time to exercise more and eat more healthily. I think this will actually come as my little boy gets older and doesn’t need so much input from me. I don’t think I’ve been very much influenced by popular ideals of what is beautiful. I still like the looks now that I liked as a teenager thirty years ago -flowing, hippy clothes for women, long skirts and hair. Tailoring for men (I like men in waistcoats!), and longish hair. No make up. I saw some photos the other day of young women going out to nightclubs in New York. They were all thin, long haired, wearing short tight dresses and very high heels. They looked anxious and miserable, adhering to the popular ideal of ‘beautiful’ and ‘sexy’, but to me they weren’t either of these (maybe men would think differently). I imagined what they’d look like in comfy jeans and t-shirts and trainers, sitting on a sofa, relaxed and laughing together. I actually really wanted to see that version. I don’t think my parents were influenced by popular ideals of health and beauty at all. They did the basics, they looked ordinary. They valued different things. I do remember that occasionally when I was little, in the 70s or 80s, my mum and dad would go out to dinner dances. My dad would wear black tie and my mum would wear a long dress with a fake fur coat, and wear perfume. I remember that they seemed very glamorous, I used to love seeing them all dressed up before they went out. Apart from that, my dad wore a suit to work every day and my mum (a teacher) would put on a bit of make up, but that was it. I don’t really ‘get ready’ at all, even for work. I put on deoderant, brush my hair and Married London Chartered Accountant teeth, wash my face and put moisturiser on, and that’s generally it. I dress as casually as I can get away with at work too -jersey dresses, cardies, comfy leggings and jumpers, trainers or knee boots. I used to like wearing jewellery that my husband had bought for me, but I stopped when my baby was born in case he pulled at it, and haven’t started again."

It has been my husband's aim in life for me for years. I have been in training for this since about 2006, so I am an old hand.THE GOVERNMENTI don't think we have enough information yet to determine the degree of criminal ineptness that this Government displayed. I believe that the UK has one of the highest death rates from the virus of the whole world. Years of running down the NHS and refusal to act quickly were both contributing factors to this, and probably more that we don't yet know about.The situation regarding untested elderly people, with the virus, being released from hospitals, to care homes and infecting the residents, was an absolute disgrace. Far too many elderly people died in that way. Thank god my parents were not still alive and in a poor state when the virus started.NEWSI have watched a few of the Government broadcasts. I gave up.	Anything to do with the Bloody Tories just makes me angry.WORK AND HOME LIFEAs previously stated, nothing much has changed in this household, except that other people are learning to live as we do. There is nothing much to recommend it unfortunately.TECHNOLOGYTo use all these weird new things like Zoom,( that I had never previously heard of), you need someone to communicate with.I have spoken to my cousin and his 2 sons on the phone a couple of times, but apart from that we are pretty isolated normally anyway.SHOPPING AND FOODThis has changed gradually since March. At the beginning of this situation, mad people were buying up hundreds of toilet rolls. Why? You can't eat them and one of the things you can do without when you are at home with only other family members present, is toilet roll. Very strange.I am one of these people that has been supposed to be 'shielding', because I have a pre-existing medical condition that makes me more likely to become seriously ill, or die, if I catch the virus (I am fine so far, but there's still time).But could we get Tesco Direct to deliver our shopping? No, all the slots were taken, probably by people with no strange diseases, but with Range Rovers and trendy apps on their hi-tech phones that told them when slots were available.Recently that too has changed and we no longer have to tip toe around in the Co-op (only one of us, usually my husband) avoiding other people. Tescos was much creepier for some reason, so we used the Co-op. These places are fine as long as you don't want flour or yeast. I have been making my own bread for over 30 years, but suddenly it was the new hobby that everyone had to have, so flour was impossible to obtain. Now I can even get that, but yeast remains unobtainable.I realised at the beginning of this that I mustn't put on weight again. I lost 2 stone 5 years ago and it was such a relief, after 9 years of being fat, that I must never regress to those podgy, padded times.I have stayed at the same weight as I was in March; usually at this time of year I would have lost a bit more, but I am just glad to have remained as I was. I am not particularly happy, so it would have been easy to just stuff myself on sweet things. My husband has been drinking more beer, although recently there has been a shortage of that.ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISUREI usually swim 5 days a week, but on about 23 March all the pools closed. I was devastated, because apart from the exercise it is the only time I talk to anyone all day, other than my husband.So I turned to walking. I usually walk back from the pool to here (about 5 miles, I think). But from the beginning I decided that I had to walk further, even though I wasn't actually meant to be out at all.PART 2	SPRING DIRECTIVE 2020COVID 19 (UPDATE)	B6664We continued to take the dog for a walk at a place the other side of the town and then I walked back (about 7 miles). In the early days there were very few people about and almost no vehicles.But I have stopped to talk to so many people (from a distance) and the peace was wonderful. This reliance on cars has to stop, but sadly, I am not sure that it ever will.My husband likes to watch too much telly at the best of times. What a waste. But we have watched some good things. I can't remember what. Stuff on Netflix and Amazon mainly.I started off reading lots of my books on VVVV2 (mainly contemporary stuff inherited from my father). I find them very interesting, but after a while it just became too depressing and I had to stop. There are only so many first -hand accounts about Auschwitz you can read, before it starts to have a very bad effect.Now I have moved on to novels that I or my parents had years ago. I am currently reading 'A Crowning Mercy' by Susannah Kells. It is better than I remembered and I am enjoying it.I had 2 books out from the library when lockdown started, so I have had ages to read them. The first was 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama, which was wonderful and inspiring; the second was about Auschwitz, so after a few pages I decided not to read it; it was just depressing.PERSONAL HYGIENEThe only thing that has changed is handwashing, which most people are doing more of, and I am no exception.Everything else is as it was. I am well-known for washing clothes, when I was younger 'too often', but in the past few years that amount of washing has become more normal.Luckily I finally stopped biting my nails a year or so ago. Before that I had bitten them for almost all of my life, so they were rarely away from my mouth.SLEEP I was sleeping much better than usual. But then a couple of weeks ago I made the mistake of mentioning the divorce again, as my husband and I were getting on so well. He was happy and relaxed, because nobody was likely to visit and I was not likely to go anywhere.It didn't go well and since then I have not been sleeping well at all. As for dreams, there is nothing much less boring than hearing about someone else's dreams, so I will spare you that. Most of them I can't remember anyway. That's the thing with dreams; most of them don't stay in the memory for long."

I've sold my house and changed jobs during the emergency.HealthNo important issues to report other than non-Covid medical procedures being delayed.The GovernmentAn utter shower. They were told by WHO declaration in late January 2020 of the global pandemic and they did nothing useful viz public education, lockdowns, masks, distancing or restricting flights etc for two whole months. I wonder how many people will remember this catastrophic mismanagement and Dominic Cummings' free pass when the May 2021 elections come around?NewsWe're watching the BBC One and BBC News Channels, BBC Radio Four news, Private Eye and The Guardianon the whole.We watched the daily briefings for a few weeks, whilst despairing at the too-little too-late government pleading and panic.I noted that the Scottish Government's briefings have sign language which are a good idea. I have no idea if there has been any progress on the English front.Work and home lifeMy husband and I have worked all through the lockdown. My work has diminished at the time the Directive was issued. The dipstick section manager I had at the time had to be reminded of their contractual obligations to pay for work already booked. She soon issued a retraction.We witnessed people on four-month furlough, some of whom did precisely nothing constructive with their time. Oh, for a paid holiday, eh?Lockdown hasn't really affected home life. Our lives have continued by and large as before but with fewer opportunities for exercise, eating out etc. We can live with this.We did assist the lives of clients by offering to fetch horticultural supplies to their door, bulbs, plants, compost, seed spuds etc. I made up packets of seeds from my own supply for those who wanted to do their own sowing but who were shielding for whatever reason. Most garden centres and nurseries were closed initially, except those attached to DIY centres and those operating by mail order.TechnologyAlthough at the time of the Directive we did not use video conferencing software, this changed later on. Modes of communication included email, telephone, and letters. We don't do social media in any case and the pandemic has not changed this.Shopping and foodEating and cooking at home have remained the same. We have eaten out much less.We carried on going to the supermarket weekly. This was to keep delivery slots free for those who really needed them. My then neighbour bragged about booking multiple deliveries weeks ahead despite being perfectly capable of going to the shops, not being in any vulnerable category, apart from being an idiot. Deliveries are notoriously unreliable in terms of getting what you ordered and we also thought that deliveries would increase the amount of times our goods were handled. It was just easier to go and get the stuff and instigate a regime of wiping each item with a damp cloth and pure liquid soap when we got home.One particularly interesting observation early on was the anger of older women. We observed two examples of this in Bury St Edmunds. The first, in the Waitrose, was of my husband who was almost jostled by a woman who reached across him at very close quarters to get some butter from a shelf. He asked if she could maintain a safe distance or say excuse me. The woman exploded at him 'don't you dare start with me'. I arrived on the scene at this point and told her to give us the space required and that whatever it was that was bothering her, it was not my husband. She harrumphed and rushed off. I tipped off the staff who said they'd had several instances of just such behaviour.The following week we experienced a woman again exploding at my husband who had politely asked a third party to move along in the very spaced-out queue. The third party's actions meant that the queue was having the stand on the road in the traffic. When the woman turned on my husband I pointed out the dangers involved. She still seemed to think this of no consequent and got personal with both of us about it. Many in Bury cannot cope with hard evidence and I could tell she wasn't used to being stood up to. There is a large contingent of well-heeled but poorly-educated women in the town who have come into money via their husband's careers. They think gives them the right to ignore logic, evidence and decency. But to my utter astonishment, someone else came to our defence. Remember, this is Bury St Edmunds, where any kind of conflict is met with silent, wide-eyed swaying. 'Madam, there's no need for that' he said authoritatively. Having almost choked with surprise I asked him what he did for a living. ''I'm a criminal lawyer in London', he said. 'Tm back at home because my work has dried up for the time being'. He said he'd 'met plenty of her sort before' having grown up in the town. Waitrose's Wild West, eh?Entertainment and LeisureJust before the WHO declaration, my husband and I made our usual trip to Cambridge for my birthday in late January 2020. My husband remembered that I commented on how many oriental students were wearing masks. Remember, this is Cambridge, where there are far fewer oriental students per head than many other UK institutions. And yet every one or oriental extraction seemed to be wearing a mask It was very noticeable.The other observation I've noticed is that they closed the pools. This has been perhaps my greatest blow but come on, some people have lost their lives, so I consider not swimming an easy sacrifice to make.We were able to drive to local walks and take daily walks and bicycle rides where we lived.Personal hygieneNo change, although I have been wearing less make-up which is an utter liberation.SleepNo change."

Imagine how we would have reacted if we had realized that the lockdown would last so long, but the time has not, to me, dragged as I am usually ALONE (not LONELY) with plenty to read, TV, writing letters and “tales” of a cat for children, pottering in my garden and in a way it has been a releif to be circumscribed as one is not tempted t do things which one does not always enjoy when more is available. At first, my local shop had sold out of food within an hour or two, but gradually things improved. Why I wondered where the shelves full of crisps, fizzy drinks and alcohol but lacking eggs and flour. We queue outside 1m apart, one out, one in, and a one-way system within the store, which is fine unless one forgets something and cannot back-track! It reminds me of the long snake in “snakes and ladders”. Prices are rising and there is still no dried milk available. Today, though, strawberries. I am not ON-LINE so cannot shop around for bargains. This lack of electronic communicationM5643, F, 94, widow, Thornhill, teacher / civil servantCOVID-19 – Coronavirus – 8 May 2020means that I keep in touch by letter or ‘phone. My larder was well-stocked due to uncertainty about outcome of BREXIT and the new scare has overshadowed that, thank the Lord. At 94, I have no interest in the NET and actually retired, aged 59, just as we were going on to computers. “They” said that people not on-line would still be able to communicate but it is almost impossible for firms etc. to communicate by ‘phone or reply to letters. I find I am making no changes in diet, except in the price I pay for fresh fruit and vegetables of which I eat a lot. The only extra things I do consist of hand washing for every contact. I have had more broken sleep, chiefly due to toilet visits, but don’t stay awake more than 5 minutes, not giving the pandemic any room in my thoughts. I consider that the emergency was badly handled at the outset and there is far too much speculation in newspapers which caused panic, manifested in panic-buying, especially of toilet rolls. At 94, I have no liking for media speculation, never read a newspaper. Perhaps the government should have been better prepared, issuing ration-books etc."

I had a fluctuating temperature and was feeling extremely fatigued. My GP thought it possible that I had the virus and told me to self-isolate for 7 days. I dreaded starting to cough or feeling really ill and unable to cope – I live alone so feared that I would have to go into hospital. My emotions were on a real roller-coaster – fear was my worst symptom. I worried about how I could keep in touch with friends if I had to be in , if I got better and returned how I could get sufficient food without any one being able to come in and help me. Everyone at my surgery was very kind and helpful. The Government I gave up watching the news and daily briefings when I started to feel unwell and have only just begun to listen to a mini news bulletin on Radio 3 in the mornings since 17 May. So I can’t comment on the government’s handling of the situation. I assume that we shall gradually ease restrictions I the same way as they are doing in France. My niece who lives in the outskirts of Paris has begun to give piano lessons again – using trains in the middle of the day, wearing a mask and carrying a permit of some kind. News As above I have been an ostrich for the past 4 or 5 weeks – a friend who is listening to every Briefing and following statistics closely occasionally passes on a bit of encouraging news. Yes, if I were deaf I would appreciate a BSL translation. Work and home life. I am retired and live alone. Although I have been on my own since my husband died 17 years ago, I still find myself feeling very lonely at times. Technology I am a bit of a Luddite – I have managed to access online Quaker Meetings on Sunday mornings with Zoom but that is about the limit of my learning new skills. I was dithering about buying a smart phone and left it too late so I have only a Stone Age mobile phone and no camera access to Zoom. I am struggling to get into a Google French class which is substituted for our regular 2hour class on a Friday. I don’t use any media platforms – I am very wary of them. Shopping and food I had problems at first in accessing online websites to shop. I actually wrote to the Customer Services Manager at Sainsbury’s explaining that I was a regular customer and was 80 – I had a very quick reply and have been able get a delivery slot regularly – for which I am very grateful. Several neighbours, who are working from home, put notes through the door and offered help with shopping – again I was most appreciative. I have been into the pharmacy once and to a mini supermarket but am not very happy about beginning to shop “normally” again. I regret to say that I have probably thrown away more food than I would ever do because I have been sent too much or haven’t been able to use things in time that I have ordered. Entertainment and leisure No new hobbies – a friend sent me a jigsaw puzzle but it was far too big for my only table. I had bought a new recorder to replace my old one which had given up the ghost but was unable to install it myself or get help to do so before lockdown; so I have watched a little television – I've been disappointed in the quality of offerings from BBC and Channel 4. Two series on BBC4 from the British Library were excellent – The Beauty of Maps and The Beauty of Books – but they were only half an hour each. I am enjoying Pride and Prejudice on BBC4 too. I listen to Radio 3 for a lot of the day and have particularly enjoyed Bach before Seven as I have often been awake by 5/5.30am. Another interesting programme on Radio 4 has been a series of 15 minute programmes called “The New Anatomy of Melancholy” featuring excerpts from a treatise written in the early 17th century – some of the author’s insights into the problems of depression are startlingly modern. I have had a newspaper bought for me most Saturdays but I have thrown away the outside pages in case they have been handled; I have not read much of the pandemic-related news – which doesn’t leave a lot for one’s money. A friend who shopped for me before I got onto shopping online put a novel in with my shopping twice. I read one book [“The Colour of Heaven” by James Runcie] but found it rather silly – I don’t like fantasy. The second, [“The Pathfinder” by Margaret Mayhew ] set in Berlin in 1948, I put aside when I wasn’t feeling well but am now enjoying it. I also finished a book in French which I had started back in January and then have since read “Notre Agent a la Havane” [ I read it in English last year and knew the story.] I have ordered two rather more “meaty” books from The Guardian Bookshop – “Istanbul” by Bettany Hughes and “Christianity – the first three thousand years” by Diarmaid McCulloch. Personal hygiene I have tried to keep to the same routine as normal – on just one night when I was feeling unwell I went straight to bed having nly cleaned my teeth and another morning I skipped my shower. I have very dry skin and am afraid I shall look even more wrinkled if I don’t cleanse and use face creams. Sleep At first, especially when I felt unwell, I had difficulty in sleeping – my GP gave me a mild sedative – just 7 tablets -I spread them out over a couple of weeks and have only used those 7 and not felt the need for any more. I get to sleep fairly quickly but I do wake early – often at about 5am ; sometimes I get back to sleep for a short while but if not at 6.30am on goes Radio 3. Although I often do remember dreams I have not been able to recallany during these weeks."

It was too early to get up so I  propped myself up in bed with extra pillows and waited for Bach Before Seven on Radio 3.  This was a good way to start the day.  I watched a lot more TV during those first few weeks. I would not normally watch daytime TV but I found one or two programmes like “Escape to the Chateau” interesting and took my mind off the problems we were facing.  I also used the phone much more – long chats with friends near and far – sadly, I have very little family so I was more dependent on friends. I usually read a lot, as I live alone, but I was not well organised in getting a supply of books from the library . I have been attending a French class for many years now and at the start I resolved to revise a few words or phrases each day.  This lasted about 3 weeks and then I wasn’t well  [My GP thought I had a mild dose of the virus but who knows] and gave up.  Perhaps now is the time to start again. I have taken a walk each day except when I wasn’t feeling well and have got to know my local parks well; recently I discovered a small park of whose existence I had not known. In 6 months I have seen a whole cycle of trees coming into leaf and now losing leaves and a variety of shrubs flowering.  I have had lots of ideas for my own small garden but so far no chance to put these into practice. I have been surprised how quickly the days pass – I cannot believe that it is now September. Many other friends of my age have said the same.  Just occasionally I have felt the time drag. Homelife I have tried to keep to a routine – I am someone who has lunch at 1pm and supper sometime between 7pm and 8pm.  Usually in the evening I make a note of things I will do the following day; I think it is good to have a structure for the day even if very little is happening. Media and Technology I am a techno-phobe.  I bought a recorder just at the start of lockdown and am still waiting for someone to come and install it for me.  Friends have offered to “talk me through it” over the phone but I view that as a recipe for disaster. However, I have had to learn to shop online – particularly for groceries and I was able to get onto the priority list for older customers at Sainsburys.  I have also used online sites to buy books and other small items. I am now able to Zoom – a considerable achievement; a friend of a friend took over my laptop remotely and was able to get the camera and mic working. I have really enjoyed being able to watch lectures and video clips from the British Museum –Enjoyable as this is, it is no substitute for actually being there.  In normal times I am a volunteer at the Museum.   Waiting I certainly feel that my life has been on hold for nearly 6 months.  Like other people of my age I am aware that I can’t afford to lose a year of my life – who knows how many are left?   I haven’t been aware of waiting for things to happen but I was waiting for the cancellation of a cruise up the Norwegian coast with Hurtigruten.  As the date drew nearer the friend with whom I was due to travel and I were both anxious that we might be expected to go as we had paid for the holiday.  We were quite relieved when the e-mail came to cancel; we have been re-booked for next April."

I have not required any medical or professional help. During the last 8 weeks since I started self isolating I have been feeling mainly up beat and happy and have been enjoying the solitude and quietness. The Government I think that the decisions that the Government has been making over the past few weeks have been very difficult decisions to make. At times these decisions have not been perfect but I do believe that they have done their best in a very difficult situation. The Opposition has been mainly constructive and supportive of the decisions and any criticism has been moderate and helpful. We now seem to be reaching a stage, as restrictions are slowly being relaxed, when a certain amount of blame is being banded around for mistakes and slowness to react as everyone would wish. However hindsight is a wonderful thing and I do think it would be more productive to stop blaming each other and get on with the job in hand as there is still a long way to go. I expect the Government to slowly relax the rules on social distancing with a great deal of caution and as long as the R factor does not rise will continue to relax the rules and get the economy going as far as possible. News I always watch the Government’s Briefing in the afternoon and the BBCprogramwhich surrounds it. I rarely watch or listen to any other news broadcasts and do not read newspapers or engage with social media. Very occasionally I listen to World News ifI amawake in the night and can’t get back to sleep and also often will watch Nicola Sturgeons broadcast at noon. The daily 5 pm press conferences have been informative about data and numbers but frustrating in rarely answering the questions put by journalists and the public. I get the impression that whoever is leading the session has an agenda and is not willing to deviate from it. I much prefer the press conferences given by Nicola Sturgeon at noon as she is far more straight forward and transparent. I do not experience challenges to access of news, nor know anyone who does, but can see that this is a problem for some people. Certainly there should be signing and I assume subtitles are available but do not know if this is so. I also wonder how various ethnic minorities gather the news, especially if they do not have good English or do not generally watch and listen to the BBC news bulletins. I think this could possibly be an area that has been missed as it does not seem that access was uppermost in the mind as BSL interpreters are not even supplied. Work and Home life I no longer work as I am retired. However, I do see a few clients on a voluntary basis. Since the lock down I have not seen any. Some spiritual directors can work from a distance, by phone, email, skype etc, but I am not able to work this way so am not sure if my few clients will be coming back to me after lock down or not. That will be their decision. As I do not charge for my sessions I do not miss the money and as I only normally spend about an hour or so a week on sessions I does not materially affect me. I also have a spiritual director and a supervisor for this work and I am not able to see them either. Spring Directive Part 2: Covid 19 (Update) 0407 Female 80 Widow Filey Spiritual Director I do not have children living with me or anyone else so my home life remains much as it normally is apart from the fact that normally I would have visitors staying here about 50% of the time, that is family and/or friends. Sometimes strangers will come for a short stay for retreat/rest purposes and, of course, this is not happening now either. This has meant that I have more time for myself, which I appreciate, although I do miss the company a bit. However, it does mean there is less domestic work for me to do and I do seem to be spending more time gardening than usual. I do not see this period as a challenge but rather as an opportunity to refresh, meditate more, live at a slower pace and do exactly as I please whenever I want. I do not experience loneliness and have contact with friends and family by email and phone most days. Technology I am not very good with technology and try to avoid it. I did have to buy a new mobile phone as my old one, purchased in 1999, started to fail a bit. The new phone is a pay as you go and is not a smart phone so not unlike my original one. It did take me a while to get it going and get used to it but I am slowly getting there. My daughter in law would normally have set it up for me but I was left with doing it myself. I am not interested in social media and do not use it. I have had two family ‘zoom’sessions which while re-assuring to see family were also most frustrating, fragmented, and strangely depressing. If they arrange another session then I will probably join in or they will get worried about me but I don’t reallylike it. Shopping and food I normally shop for groceries on line and only one supermarket delivers in Filey so that is who I shop with. I shop on line because I would usually have a delivery just prior to receiving visitors, maybe twice a month, and then I need quite a lot and am not able to carry it, nor do I have a car. Since lock down my orders are smaller and mainly cheese, eggs, fresh fruit, vegetables and salads plus any cleaning requirements. Getting a slot for delivery was very difficult at first but is now quite a bit easier. Also I am never too sure what would be delivered as many items were not available in the early days of lock down so I often got nothing or substitutions which I always accepted, and at one point I could not get eggs for at least two weeks. At times this was frustrating and sometimes hilarious, for example ordering courgettes and getting a kilo of onions instead. Fortunately I am an experienced cook and managed to create something edible whatever was sent. In some ways this was challenging and I enjoyed that. I do not usually eat meat, bread, potatoes or milk unless I have visitors so have not been buying those items. Apart from that I am eating what I would normally eat and cook a main meal every day and also have a small snack at some point. The main meal would be rice/pasta with fish, eggs or cheese and a lot of greens or salad. Basically my eating habits have stayed the same as they would be when on my own. When I have visitors my eating habits are a bit different and would include meat and bread, alcohol – mostly red wine for me, and potatoes and I would eat later in the day. As I rarely drink alcohol on my own my consumption has dropped dramatically and I find that I do not miss it – I need good company to enjoy a drink. One very good change is that our local fishmonger is now delivering and accepting BACs payments, taking orders over the phone. As I eat so much fish and his fish is so fresh and delicious this is great for me. He also accepts rhubarb from me which helps to reduce the amount that I have growing in the garden. All deliveries of food have been observing the social boundary rules which is reassuring. Spring Directive Part 2: Covid 19 (Update) 0407 Female 80 Widow Filey Spiritual Director Entertainment and Leisure As I normally would be entertaining family and friends for 50 % of my time plus preparing bedrooms, meals, clearing and cleaning afterwards I found that I have quite a bit more time since lock down started. Strangely the time seems to be speeding up with less to do and the weeks are just flying past. I think this is mainly due to the fact that I must have slowed down quite a bit. At the start of the lock down I decided to take myself through an Ignatian retreat which would normally take about 4 weeks of meditation, undertaking various spiritual exercises, keeping a journal, reviewing my experience etc. I did undertake this and the whole process certainly helped to centre and slow me. Meditation also has the same effect. I have now finished that but am still meditating on a regular basis. In addition I have been working through several hundred letters that my father wrote to my mother between 1931 and 1951 which has been very absorbing and time consuming – another thing that I have now finished. Some household chores such as polishing all the old wooden floor boards throughout the house, quite heavy physical work, and hanging some pictures, and sorting out a years worth of filing have kept me busy. Also my large garden has needed plenty of attention over the last couple of months. I have not taken up any new hobbies, nor learned new skills or games but have managed to increase my walking early most mornings. I am regularly writing letters to my youngest granddaughter (aged 9) to which she writes back and we also email each other. The older grandchildren, six more aged 12 -30, also email from time to time along with my own five children and friends, and there are also the many phone calls to answer. As a family we have had a zoom session twice. With my eldest son we are jointly writing Haiku taking it in turns to write a line, via email. I watch about the same amount of TV as usual and generally in the evenings. Box sets, medical dramas, and sci-fi films are my choice. I am re-reading the Harry Potter series and have a new Stephen King novel waiting. I do not listen to the radio or music but do spend some time sitting in the garden listening to the birds singing and trying to identify them. Personal Hygiene No change there really except I am washing my hands more often. As my hair, normally kept quite short, is now growing and getting unruly I have bought some hair bands to keep it in place. The only other change is that I do wear my top clothes for more days than I would before although I do still change my underwear every day. Sleep I find that I am sleeping better than before, longer and deeper. This is because of the increased meditation and the more frequent walks I think. I always dream interesting dreams and remember my dreams for a while on awakening. If they seem of particular interest then I record them and spend some time thinking about what they are saying to me. The general trend of most of my dreams latelyhas to do with absorbing and grasping the content of myfather’s letters, as these letters have revealed more of my father than I previously realised and also have explained some of the family myths and secrets. None of them particularly disturbing but, of course, great interest and import to me. I have had the occasional dream about meeting family members. None of my dreams have been distressing."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I feel very fortunate that me and my husband are in good health. Neither of us have caught Covid­19 and neither of us have any chronic health issues that affect us. We’ve notneeded any medical help at all. A friend of mine referredto the emotional ride duringthis time as a ‘coronacoaster’ which Ithinkis very fitting! I’ve mostly been fine, especially as I’m very fortunate compared to other people. I’m working full time, I like the person I live with and have no healthissues.MostlyI’ve justbeengetting on with life. About a month ago I got quite fed up with everything. I had such a full life before lockdown and I felt so limited, so sick of the same four walls. But my birthday came soon after and that really cheered me up.We couldn’tgo anywhere to celebrate but we had afun dayeither way. Ithinkmymoodhasgenerallybeengoodbecauseofthegoodweather.We’vebarelyhadanyrain during the past two and a half months, apart from today ironically. It means that I’ve been able to get out into the city and go for walks. I live in the city centre and me and my husband have explored everywhere! I’ve really been enjoying pictures of Leeds. Of architecture, flowers, art, anything I thinkisinterestingreally.I’vethenbeenputtingthemonsocialmediaandI’vebeenreallysurprised by the reactionsofpeople. They’ve reallyliked seeing them. Ihave missed seeing myfriends.Withlockdowneasingalittle I’ve seen the localonesalittle more (I’m notusingpublictransportrightnowso can’tsee the oneswho arefurtherafield)andit’s made me feel so much better. It’s amazing how that one little thing can really boost your mood. Technology can’t replace face to face interaction (although it’s definitely helped to keep in touch with people). I still miss being able to go to people’s houses though. To eat, drink and play board games. It’s simple but makesadifference. I guess the other emotion I’ve been feeling is anger. Anger at the government’s continuing ineptitude.It’sgotworse overtimeandthepastfewweekshavebeenveryfrustrating. The UK has had the most Covid-19 deaths in Europe and now that lockdown is slowly being eased (way before it should Ithink)and I’ve noticedpeople breaking socialdistancing rules, I’ve been quite fearful. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Oh man, where to start with this one! At the beginning of the crisis I was actually quite impressed with how politicians stood aside and let the scientific advisors speak and lead the way. This whole crisis should have always been lead by science. It started with Person Protection Equipment (PPE) failing to get to frontline health workers who needed it back in April but as time has gone on things have just got worse and worse. Iguessthe peakwasafewweeksago whenthe PrimeMinister’sadvisorDominicCummingswas caught breaking the rules and travelling the length of the country while sick before going sight seeingforhiswife’sbirthday.The subsequentdesperationfrompoliticianstoexcusehisbehaviour was pretty disgusting. He should have been sacked straight away but we have a weak leader who relies on his advisor so he doubled down and defended his actions in the most ridiculous way. People were so angry about it, and rightfully so. People have missed funerals, closed their businesses, not seen friends and family for months and yet, for this one man breaking the rules was ok? It’s one rule for them another for the rest of us. The repercussions are so dangerous as people then start breaking lockdown and put themselves and other people at risk. The dissemination of information over the past month has been really confusing. Leaking the potential easing of lockdown to the press with no explanation hasn’thelped either. There’s been a generalfeeling recentlythatpeople justdon’tknow what’sitokto do and not do. The weird thing is that the government response is completely at odds with my experience of to make sure that the relevant work has a through line right to the top. We’ve taken in temporary staff from other departments who have quickly risen to the challenge. The department has conducted hundreds of pieces of analysis which has been so impressive. Comparing our work to the government’s I just see this massive disconnect which I just can’t get my head around. How can things go so wrong when the workbehind it has been so good? It’s aquestion Idon’tthinkI’ll ever answer to be honest although even within my small team they have been several uses of the word ‘inquiry’ so we’ll see. In summary,itallstartedoff wellbutquicklydescendedintothecurrentlygovernment’susualtricks which has put the nation’s health at risk. I’m angry but hey, this country gets the politicians it deserves. That’s what happens when you have a Cabinet chosen for Brexit loyalty rather than competence. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. When the crisis first hit I did watch the daily briefings and news. I felt it was important because everything was happening so quickly and I wanted to keep up with everything. But I found myself becoming quite anxious. The impact caused a huge culture shock what with working life changing, shops shutting,eventsbeing cancelled and then fulllockdown. Ithinkit’s easytoforgethow scary it all felt because it was unprecedented.SoIquicklystoppedwatchingthenewsasmuch.I’mactive on social media and Ifiguredthat important newswouldfind it’s wayto meanyway.ForanythingI missed I knew I’d be able to pick it up in The Week (which sums up the news from across the globe),whichI’vereadforyears. Ineverreadnewspapers,they’regenerallyquiteuntrustworthyas information sources. At the beginning, when the daily briefings were novel I was pleased to see Professor Chris Whitty, that to the public was really great. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Funnily enough the first time I saw one of the Scottish briefings I pointed out the sign language interpreterandIwassoannoyedthattheEnglishonesdidn’thaveone.Orsubtitles.Ifyou’retrying to get important information out to as many people as possible why wouldn’tyou make an effortto be inclusive? Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I’ve beenreallyfortunatewith my working life as I was already geared up to work at home although a keyworkereven thoughI’m only rather than a front line worker, not that I don’t see the value in what I do. My entire role is centred around providing evidence to analysists and policy makers and my work has definitely shifted to focus on Covid-19. I helped to provide evidence for a paper on children and Covid-19 and even got namechecked in the piece when it was published in which was a great feeling. Lotsofpeoplehavebeen talkingaboutnewhobbiesthey’vetakenup while in lockdownbutasI’ve been workingfulltime Idon’treallyfeelthatIhave anymore spare time than Ididbefore. My husbandisalso workingfromhome during lockdown andI’m verythankfulthatwe live in atwo bedroom flat because at least we can work in separate rooms. We’ve been alternating rooms depending on what work he has on. I actually quite miss going into the officetoworkasI’ve always liked to physical separation between my home and work life. I also miss getting to chat to colleagues face to face. I have to say that my employers have been really great when it comes to meeting virtually.We’ve not been using video calls like some workplaces, it’s always been group phone calls but we have regular meet-ups, both work-related and not. We have twice weekly meeting where we each talk about a work success, what we’ve been doing away from work and how we’ve been feeling generally.It’sactuallybeenareallygreatwaytogetto knowcolleaguesabitbetter,partlybecause we’ve taken on a lot of temporary staff from other departments and partly because some of our permanent team work in London. I’m reallyinterested to see how this period affects working life in the long run. We were already set up for working from home but even my team is talking about how we can take the positives from this time and keep them going. For offices who have been forced to move people to home working I wonder if they’ll stick with it. Plenty of my colleagues are realising how much time is ‘wasted’ on their daily commute and I can’t imagine that any of them are in a hurryto go backto thatbecause of the time and cost,especiallyif it’s a commute into London. There are definitely ergonomic repercussions for home working. The head of my team can’t type at the moment because she’s hurt her wrist due to home working and I’m finding that my back is hurting more often, probably because my laptop is slightly too low on the desk for me. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Like I’ve said previously, I’ve been very lucky with my life under lockdown and I reallyfeel for the people who have had to home school. I know that my workplace has been supportive of this but I’ve heard stories of people who have had the pressures of work on top of childcare with little sympathy from their bosses. I’ve lived with myhusbandfor 13 years so I knew that we’dbefine withthe isolation. Iwas talking to another married couple the other day who are inasimilarpositionto usandtheysaidthatthey’d been more ‘tetchy’ with each other but generally ok (I’m still laughing at seeing them after a walk they’d been on. “How was it?” I asked. “We argued a lot and then I stood on a dead rat”. Haha.). Sometimes one of us is just sick of seeing the same four walls and are just generally fed up with everything. But we know when to give each other space and when to support each other. And it’s been a nice chance to spend time together so yeah, I’ve been really lucky. We’ve often gone on walks around the city centre together andI’vefoundthatthat’sourtime to talkaboutlife in the time of Covid-19, to analysis the situation and get our feelings out. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? At the beginning of the crisis I was quite enthusiastic about discovering all of the technology and seeing what it does. Asthe weeks have gone on some of it has stuck and some of it hasn’t. I use Houseparty with one group offriendsevery once in a while and I’ve had a fewWhatsapp calls withfamily.We alreadyuseSkypeatworksoIwasfamiliarwiththatbutI’vealsousedit at home to talk to a couple of friends I know too. In my experience there are so many apps out there and they all do something slightlydifferentbutthere’salotof crossover.GenerallyI muchprefer to chatto smallgroups. The more people there are in a chatthe more exhaustingitis because it’sharder to be heard. One thing that we’ve played around with has been virtual board games. Generally me and my husband will be sat in different rooms, each on a laptop with a video call going on over Whatsapp with two other friends. It can’t replicate the board game evenings we hold in person but it goes some way to replicating it. We’ve played around a bit with Board Game Arena and Tabletopia. Alternatively we’ve been figuring out which physical board games work over video call too. We played Disney Villainous with a friend over Zoom because we both had copies of the game and it worked really well. We also played a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game with friends over Skype. We had props and hats which was silly but really fun. I also do some online gaming with my siblings via the Playstation 4.Wedidthatbefore lockdown anywaybutit’sanotherpieceoftechnologythat has helped with social interaction. I’vebeenquitesurprisedbywhohassteppedupwithkeepingintouchandwhohasn’tifI’mhonest. Somefriendswe’ve got closerto bychattingonlineandothershave been reallysilent. It’spuzzling because it’snotlike anyofusare reallybusy.ButforthemostpartIuse technologyto supplement or enhance physical friendships so the people who were good at that before are still good at that now. Honestly, I don’t know how we’d have coped without the internet during this crisis and that goes for both work and home life. I was already a big user of socialmedia before the crisis butI’ve foundthatit’s been areallygood excuse to use them for my regular walks. I live in the city centre and I’ve been varying my route around Leeds, taking pictures of interesting places. Whether that’s landmarks, murals, nature or stuffthat’salittleodd.IthenpostthisonlineandI’vebeen reallysurprisedbythefeedback.Imostly did it for my own amusement because I like being a tourist in my own city but people have said how much they’ve enjoyed myphotos so it’s nice to thinkthat I’m cheeringpeople up, even if it’s just in a small way. Leeds Tourism should charge me commission for my Instagram account at this point! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? During the crisis the availability of different groceries has changed over time. At the beginning there was a run on toilet rolls, pasta and hand sanitiser and that took a long time to come back to being regularly available. You could get toilet rolls more easily from the start of May I’d say and pasta from mid-May. By that time people were struggling to get hold of flour and yeast as more people took up baking. Other baking goods like chocolate chips have also been hard to get hold of, probably because of all of the children being at home too. I have to say that availability of goods has varied from place to place. I remember going into my localSainsbury’sand the entire wine fridges were empty apart from 2 bottles prices £13 and some alcohol free bottles. That tells you a lot about what British people are willing to put up with when it comes to alcohol! But mylocalMarks andSpencer’swine aisle wastotally full. I think that in general supply chains have held up really well, it’s just taken supermarkets a little while to figure out what to order in and what will sell. I remember early on in the crisis going into a larger city centre Tesco and them having no meat, little cheese and little milk, probably because they were wary of ordering in perishables rather than people stockpiling. Similarly I remember a different smaller Tesco having a lot of reduced fresh pastries and sandwiches. With fewer office workers in the city those items just wasn’t selling. One of the things that has changed recently is that we now eat our main, ‘big’ meal at lunchtime rather than later on. I have no idea why that’s happened really. Because I’m not spending much money right now I’vebeenable to spend more on food.It’sprobablythe onlytime in mylife that I’ll be able to afford to shop at Marks and Spencer butI’ve been enjoying it. Honestly, it’s been good to spend moneyon nicefood as I’m generallyquite careful with money. Therearealsosmalldifferencesin what we’ve beeneatingtoo.We wouldn’tusuallybuybreadbut wehavebeendoingduringlockdown.ThismeansthatI’vebeenspendingmoreonnicepreserves as Ioften have toastforbreakfast now. Similarly we’ve been eating more asparagus than we ever wouldbefore.It’s usuallyquite expensive butit’s recentlybeen in season and itaddssome variety to diet. We’ve been buying slightly more expensive fruit too – grapes, peaches etc. I’ve bought a jar of instant coffee for the first time in my life. I’ve been drinking more tea as I’ve been at home more and I wanted something different. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. AsI’vesaidpreviouslyIdon’tfeellikeI’vehadanymoreleisuretimethannormalbecauseI’vebeen working.However,therehave been afewthingsI’vespentmore timeon.The mostobviousone is baking. I’m a baker anyway but I’ve definitely done more recently. I seem to have developed a reputation at work for making weird vegetable cakes. I made a chocolate beetroot cake recently butthe one that’ll I’ll never live down is my spinach cake which came out a beautiful green colour. IttastedlovelytooalthoughIdon’tthinkthatmycolleaguesbelievedme!Irecentlymadea Orange Polenta Cake as well as an Italian Grape Cake. I often make slightly unusual bakes but I’ve definitely branched out lately. I’ve spentmore time playing videogamesandbecauseI’mnotreallyspending moneyonanything I’ve bought more board games too. They’re two hobbies I had before but I’m definitely spending more time on them at the moment. Me and my husband are big film fans anyway but we’ve been watching afilma day since the 22nd March.We’ve been watching alotofDVDsthatwe can then donate elsewhere,althoughbecause they charity shops are closed we have a cupboard full of donations and nowhere to take them! It’s been a fun exercise, especially watching one or two epics because we have the time to watch a four hour film (usually in two halves). I’ve also been watching more TV. It’sgenerallybeenmore feelgood shows. Much like myreading habits, anything distinctly dystopian feels a little too close to the bone at the moment. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? When lockdown first started I gave up shaving completely. It was more of an experiment really because when else would I get a block of time to try something like that out? I shaved after two weeks though because I wasn’t that keen. I don’t shave as often at the moment though, just like how Irarelyput my contactlenses in. There doesn’t seem like much point when you’re not seeing anyone. However, I do find that I feel better when I make a slight effort with my appearance so I never let things get too out of hand. Ialways shower everydaybut I don’t put deodorant on as often. Idon’t always wear itanyway as I don’t sweat all that much in general but I’ve definitely cut down. Alternatively I wash my hands more because that was always the official advice right from the start. Even if I go downstairs to check the post box I always wash my hands when I get back to my flat. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. When lockdown first started I had a little trouble sleeping because I was quite anxious. We also had problems with our next door neighbour playing loud music late at night but thankfully he’s stopped that after we sent him a polite note. I’mmore ofanightowlanywaybut mysleepingpatternhasshiftedalittlebit.Iprobablygo to sleep around 11.45pm and get up at around 8.45am whereas before I would go to sleep at around 11.20pm and wake up at 8.15am and go to work. My husband went through a phase of waking up very early, 6am sometimes, and not being able to get back to sleep. He seems to have passed that now though. Irarely remembered mydreamsbefore andhaven’t recentlyeither. I’ve alwaysbeen lucky in that I have little trouble sleeping. (Written 5th June 2020)"

Male, 77, widower (now having a partner), retired civil servant, Cardiff.COVID19 (Update)I have not previously commented, so this not so much of an update as an initial report. I have been particularly careful not to unwittingly give away my identity by giving too much personal details, while writing this report. Thus a few significant matters have been omitted all together.I will refer to my partner as P; she and I live in separate homes.HealthI am on various routine tablets, such as statins, blood pressure. I have need a repeat prescription a couple of weeks ago, and obtained it without problem. I did need a blood test in advance of an upcoming (telephone) consultation which was done at a local hospital. Social distancing was observed of course, my temperature was taken and I was asked various questions regarding my health and those of anyone who lived with me. I wore a mask, as did the staff of course.A short while after lockdown I fractured one of my front teeth, but still hanging on (by a thread?). On phoning the dentist I discovered that all dentists are closed! I was able to speak to the dentist who was working from home. He was able to access my records and assure me that it would be OK, but I should wash my mouth daily with a branded mouth wash.A consultation with my financial advisor was done over the phone.The GovernmentThis perhaps the best place to comment on the Welsh First Minister's introduction of the Welsh Road Map, introduced at a daily briefing. As an introduction it was fine, but it gave no details of the said Map. It comprised three zones - red, amber and green; we apparently are near the read zone. This confusingly is different to the situation in England which has five zones, the red of which was when the virus was rampant before lockdown. Then apparently the zone boundaries are not rigid and some features might 'migrate' from one zone to another. No mention was made as to how to access the Plan, a 20 page document. P did manage to find a press briefing on line, which gave an outline of the Plan. All in all I was confused and disappointed.I get the impression that the UK government are reacting to events, rather than being pro-active, also to shifting their ground. I have not kept a record of what precisely, but the following is an example. Early on we were shown a graph showing a peak of deaths followed by one or two subsequent inevitable peaks. A crucial aim we were told was to ensure the following peaks were as small as possible. Now we are told that a second peak must be avoided at all costs. Further, the government made a commitment that certain year groups of primary school children would return on 1 June. After a huge national fuss as to whether it is safe to do so, they are now back tracking, saying there was always flexibility in their plans.It all goes to show that lockdown across the whole of society was easy; getting it start will be no easy matter; each sector will raise its own problems, eg transport.NewsRather that go out each day for The Daily Telegraph I have been having it delivered­ delivered free for 6 weeks. I largely rely on the paper for my main source of news.First thing in the morning I listen to the Today programme coverage, and then some of the BBC Breakfast programme (not a regular before), before starting the paper. Later I watch the J o'clock and 6 o'clock News bulletins as I usually do. I quite often find the reports depressing; and why do we need to know death tolls in Spain, Italy and India? (Maybe because there are so many of their nationals living here?) I sometimes watch the daily 5pm briefings, and also the Welsh which come on at 12.30pm. They vary greatly information-wise, sometimes they are not up to much and I switch off.The excellent detailed reports of the easing of the lockdown in England do not apply here in Wales; once it does start to ease here in Wales I doubt it will have such good coverage.A few days after writing the previous sentence the Welsh First Minister at the daily press briefing announced the Welsh Road Map. This was not reported in the national newspaper.Work and home life.As retirees, P and I have of course not been working. My daughter, who lives 30 minutes drive away was furloughed for a few weeks, but is back to work now; her partner works in the community and thus is at risk.The greatest impact on home life arises from the situation of P and me not living together. Prior to lockdown our lives were very closely integrated, such that we spent much of every day together - shopping, watching TV, car trips, visiting friends, weekends away, voluntary work, sleeping over. All this has had to stop. The best we have been able to do, is to coordinate daily walks keeping 2 metres apart, sometimes sitting for a while, so that we have at most an hour together - thus far the weather has been good and dry. The only physical contact we have is touching finger tips through gloved hands! This separation has been hard to bear, with little prospect of significant change for a while. We do of course spend a fair while each day on the phone, but it is not the same.      *   There is some hope at last: today (18/5) it is reported that the Welsh Administration is actively considering the question of family and friends being able to meet (outdoors).TechnologyI keep in touch with P and my children using the land lines and mobile phones. P and I speak several times a day. I have now downloaded AhatsApp which has certain advantages. I phone other family, friends and former colleagues from time to time as it occurs to me.Apart from the newspaper and TV bulletins, I also look at the BBC News App now and again. I can also search the net on my mobile.Shopping and foodP shops for both of us just once a week; I dictate a list the evening before. The list is fairly standard, but rarely used items crop up now and again. What we miss I suppose are the serendipitous things that catch the eye in passing. To that extent shopping is a bit predictable, so that my freezer is biased to chicken breasts and fish (of several varieties though). That said I look out for recipes in the weekend papers, and have extended my range a bit, without buying special ingredients I am never likely to use again. I try to eat a good supply of fresh vegetables, with frozen as a stand-by. I still*1/6 at last we can meet in each other’s gardens, under pergolas (it rained for almost the first time today (3/6) in weeks. We have taken advantage (tea, coffee, lunch): it makes so much difference.eat a plentiful supply of fruit - fresh and tinned - primarily at breakfast, but generally some at lunch time and at dinner time.I generally still have an alcoholic every day; now the summer is here generally beer, but that is some times non-alcoholic, so my units is less than previously.Entertainment and leisureMy leisure has not changed significantly. I watch rather more TV - in addition to antiques programmes, there are some really good travel programmes. I am not mad keen on Tony Robinson, but like Michael Portillo (but then he went to the same schools as me!) Over recent years I have weeded out a great deal of the paper back fiction I had, so I am a bit bereft of reading material. I have several volumes of Michael Palin's travelogues which I have started to read, along with a couple by Paul Theroux. I am currently (re?)reading The hunchback of Notre Dame, which I was give as a Christmas present when I was 14!I have done a few DIY jobs but do not wish to go out a queue at B & Q for hours - Iguess like supermarkets they are out of popular items like white paint!I have a reasonable sized garden which I try to keep tidy and useful. Its main problem is extensive weed and moss in the lawn; I try every year to deal with it but am always defeated. In all this fine weather I have been fairly active in the garden, in particular reviving a small vegetable patch.Personal hygieneI shower most days still (extensive washing if not), usually before 7 o'clock. I then shave. I normally use a pre-electric that Boots sell, but I am out of it and haven't replaced it; likewise my favourite after shave. I don't get such a good shave, but having to keeping a social distance from P it is not a problem! But I still use under­ arm deodorant. I have never grown a beard or moustache, and even though P is not keen I thought I'd have a go at a moustache for a few weeks; but it was like straw growing out of my face and was dark on one side and light on the other, so I shaved it off after two weeks.I have managed to cut my hair with electric clippers. P reckons it looks quite good. My washing machine packed up a day or two - as it happens - just before lockdown. A new one was delivered, but there was no time to fir it or remove the old one. So P does almost all my washing - Bless her.SleepMy usual sleep pattern is as follows: bed just after 10, woken by my bladder at 2, read or play codewords (a sort of crossword without clues) for a bit, hopefully this gets me through till 6ish with sometimes another bathroom visit; now and again my bladder plays up all night. I dream occasionally.Nowadays this pattern is quite disturbed. I quite often find it difficult to get to sleep, or worse still wake before midnight sitting up in bed with my glasses on and the light still on. It is then very difficult to get back to sleep again. I often wake at 4ish finding it difficult to get back to sleep or decide to read or not, or turn the radio on quietly. I dream quite a bit now, with the dreams often being mildly disturbing. P also finds her sleep pattern disturbed along similar lines to my own."

Aged 70. Retired Social Worker. Widow.  Living in Bristol. Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2 : Everyday Health and Wellbeing… Health. Good health means having no physical problems or long term ongoing conditions which interfere with your functioning and life style. Wellbeing This is different , it is more an internal state. Good health can contribute to one's wellbeing, but it is not the entire picture. Wellbeing is dependent on how one perceives the outside world from one's own inner perspective. In my opinion wellbeing is more to do with mental health-thus one could have a sense of wellbeing inspite of being in poor health, and vice-versa. A healthy body. Fit, strong, hardy, painfree, energetic. I see this as a young person who takes the efficient working of their body for granted. Identity I do not think that my experience of health has been influenced by my gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. I believe education has been more influential in that I know about the conditions which I have  and when to take action. I admit that social class might be a beneficial factor as I  have the confidence to ask for help and to complain if necessary. Also my health would probably be worse if I had grown up in poor conditions. Wellbeing is slightly different. I am lucky to have come from a stable background and have been loved and encouraged by my family.  This has been helped by lack of poverty in my childhood , and a good education , job etc., all of which have contributed to my sense of personal satisfaction and therefore well being. Inspite of many difficulties in my private life I would say that I have been largely content with my lot, and have usually had a sense of wellbeing. I have been lucky to have many good friends and plenty of interests, and a lovely family. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing. I was aware of health issues quite young  because I had two spells in hospital with pneumonia and pleurisy when I was aged 7 and 8. Each time I spent about a month away from home, and could only see my Mother very occasionally. This was hard. I was frightened when I was taken away in the ambulance and I remember the feel and smell of the red blanket. D826 I knew I was ill. I knew the other children in my class were at school but I couldn't go, and so I felt left behind. Later I had chronic excema which accentuated my sense of difference. I was used to having trouble with breathing and with itching. My parents, particularly my Mother, were responsible for my health. They did not really talk about it with me, but loved and cared for me so it minimized what I was experiencing. I remember two incidents which contributed to my sense of wellbeing. My Father would come in my bedroom when he came  home from work, from time to time he would bring me a puffin book which was wonderful. Reading was, and has continued to be, a great solace. Another memory is that of my best friend's Mother coming to see me – we looked at every picure in the Observer book of Dogs and she talked about each breed to me. I watched my Mother take pleasure from tending her garden and indoor plants, and from actively caring for me and my Father. Her life was not easy, but she made the best of  it, something I have always tried to do. This has definitely contributedto my sense of well being , and influenced me to realise that money is not everything. I do not remember any conversations about health at school. I leaned about it from my own personal experiences. Key Moments. I did not reach puberty until I was about 15, and this was a great source of distress for me, because it accentuated my sense of difference to my friends again. Later my Mother told me that she consulted the GP about the delay, who told her not to worry, but I did not know this at the time. I hated having a flat chest, but when it did develop it was a good size. I don't remember growing pubic hair. I have no memory of buying my first bra, but I'm sure my mother helped me. My Mother was excellent , she explained everything that would happen, and prepared sanitary equipment in the form of the hideous sanitary towels and belt. I was not bothered about this, and have no memory of when it finally did happen. She never made a fuss about it herself. However, I recall that she was very worried about my desire to use Tampax, and I had to buy some myself when I was a bit older , and try it out. I was very relieved when I got to be like everyone else. Growing Older Once I recovered from my childhood ill-health I learned how to live with excema which has lurked about for the rest of my life. I just accept that I have flare ups from time to time, and I have had to use moisturising creams  and ointments  all the time. This is ok, there are a lot of conditions far worse. Similarly I have lived with respiratory problems most of my life as a result of my childhood illnesses. So I have frequently suffered from chest infections , breathlessness etc, but this has been controlled with antibiotics and inhalers. This has not seriously impinged on my life , I am  just used to it. Until my husband died I was relieved of my anxiety about my health because he was a GP. He D826 would always tell me if I needed to go to my own GP ( not often!). However, since then I have worried far more about myself and my health, and particularly since the pandemic. I have consulted GP more about various minor issues since I have been alone, and I sometimes look on NHS website about medical matters. In addition there is the factor of age. I have friends who are developing cancer, having strokes , and other life altering conditions. This is certainly making me much more aware of my body. I know that I have to accept that my body is beginning to wear out, but as yet I am pretty fit. Although I would prefer to ignore some of my symptoms, I realise that I have to be sensible for the sake of my children. I do not want to burden them. However, the prospect of increasing deterioration is not very positive. I eat properly, go out for a walk daily, and do pilates to keep supple. I try to sleep well-I never had a problem with this until my husband died, and was just recovering my sleep pattern when the pandemic interfered with it again. However, I have always tried not to worry about lack of sleep, and just read if I have insomnia. Health, wellbeing and appearance. I have never really been influenced by popular ideas of beauty and physical appearance. I like to think I have my own style-I do not wear make-up , nor do I dye my hair, but I am interested in clothes and how I look. When young I conformed to the fashion of mini-sirts, mascara etc etc, , but I was not very worried about how I looked. However , in retrospect, looking at old photos, I looked much better than I thought. I can understand how young women suffer self body distortion. Health and wellbeing are related to physical appearance, and I am more sensitive to this as I age. It is hard to look and feel good if you are in pain or depressed. I admire people who make the effort to dress nicely and put on “ a brave front” inspite of their own problems, whether mental or physical. Of course a person's spirit and personality will still be there inspite of their appearance, and one should not be biased and put off by an unattractive or disfigured face and body. A benefit of age is that one has the confidence to portray oneself as one wants without worrying about what others think . The pandemic has not been helpful in terms of the morale building which results from looking nice to go out . I have worn the same uniform of jeans and jumper/t-shirt for nearly a year. There have been no occasions to warrant dressing up-though I have just forgotten my 70th birthday in October 20 when I put on a DRESS to go to my daughter's house for a celebratory meal ( I'm in a bubble with them). Also I put festive clothing on for Christmas Day. Other than those times I haven't been in any other house or doing anything except walking, so no point . I am looking forward to wearing some of my other clothes which will defintely boost my sense of wellbeing. In conclusion , wellbeing is very much a state of mind. It involves acceptance of one's circumstances and trying to be positive about life. There is always something to be thankful for and I try to maintain this approach."

Living in Bristol . Retired Social Worker Mass-Observation Spring Directive 2020 Part 2 Covid Health Physical problems: I had a sore throat for 5 weeks but no other symptoms. I never ever have a sore throat, so I was concerned. Eventually phoned GP – was able to speak to him quite easily. He told me to phone back in a month if not better, which I did. He then prescribed a product to combat thrush type infections which seemed to help. I also discussed a long running( since January) ear problem . I was informed that were it not for Covid he would refer me to ENT Department. I also became exceedingly anxious about a mole on my leg which had changed in appearance. As I had a friend who died from skin cancer I was worried. The receptionist who was operating triage said that NHS did not deal with warts. I insisted on speaking to a Dr. He asked me to send a photo. It was very difficult to take a picture on a phone with 1 hand whilst trying to pull the back of my leg round … it was verystressful. Unsurprisingly the GP could not tell fromthis-also I was upset operating the technology on my phone to send it. The GP asked me to come to surgery so he could check. He met me in the car park of the surgery. He was dressed in a plastic apron and ordinary mask-I was wearing a mask too. He took me in the back door-I whisked up my trouser leg, he took a look, and immediately said it was an old age thing, no problem. However, he said it was good to be careful. It is becomimg inceasing difficult to get a phone appointment with a GP. I tried this week again about my ears, took 2 days and waiting in a queue for 15 minutes 1 day, and 11 the next. I am now expecting a phone call from GP later this week. I have found it much harder to be alone concerning my health during lockdown. My anxiety levels have been high because I have been more inclined to think about myself due to lack of activites outside the home. In addition my late husband was a retired GP , and he would always advise me whether an ailment was worth worrying about. I have also had rapid heart beats, but think that these are to some extent due to anxiety. I dislike the fact that I am preoccupied with my health. Now , July 2020, I have adjusted to this method of living. It is tedious, at times I feel sad, but I try to enjoy what I can. If this is going to be the rest of my life I must be as positive as I can. However, I think I have displaced my anxiety about the future into worries about my health! The Government I do not feel the Government has dealt well with Covid. We have the highest rate of Covid in Europe. Clearly we were too late beginning Covid lockdown. -too late making masks obligatory. We had not prepared for a pandemic by amassing protective clothing inspite of being advised that this was going to happen. We did not have tests in place-many many old people were discharged from hospital without having Covid tests, so the virus spread rapidly. I am fairly sure the Winter will bring more outbreaks. I just hope my grandchildren can go to school. There will be local lockdowns. I do not know how the Government can keep the economy going as well as protect us from the virus. We are being encouraged to go out and spend money, but also social distance. There is the added difficulty that some members of society are more at risk than others. News. I listen to the news on Radio 4 at 8 or 9am , and sometimes 1 and 6pm. If there is nothing else I watch 10.00pm news on BBC1. In addition I have checked news on my phone. I do not think this is healthy-and certainly I have turned off programmes or descriptions of effects of the virus. There have been many horrifying interviews. I did not watch the Government broadcasts on Covid because I did not believe what was said. I feel obliged to keep up to date with what is permitted, and to have some idea whether the virus is increasing or not. It is depressing to be in the cohort of the elderly. I will be 70 later this year-no chance of the celebrations I would liked to have had. I feel as though we are rather a nuisance-high risk-not contributing anything to the economy, and best of of sight. I do not know anyone who has had challenges accessing the news. I do have a friend without access to the internet and lacking the skills to use it. She is very much at a disadvantage now that so much extra is available on line-particularly cultural events, online shopping, extra links to friends, research . It will get worse. I dislike technology , but I am grateful to my children who urged me to have a smart phone 2 years ago, and helped me use it. Work and Home Life I am retired . I was widowed a few years ago, and had become accustomed to life alone in the house-also made easier by the fact that I was an only child and used to my own company. However, the fact that I could not see people and carry out my usual activities was very hard to bear. I was most upset by separation from my 2 children, their spouses and families who also live in Bristol. Enforced separation from your loved ones is awful. Once single people were able to be a in a social bubble with another household I joined up with my daughter and family . We mostly met going for walks, and then in their garden. I have tried to help with home schooling my 8 year old granddaughter. During the last 6 weeks of term her 5 year old brother was permitted to go to school 2 days a week, but she was not eligible. She was depressed and angry, particularly missing her peer group. At first I worked in the garden with her-even in the rain!! Soon it became evident that she was not responding to this approach, so I changed to going for walks and talking about nature, history, street architecture etc. anything which caught her interest. I also read my old childhood favourite books to her-Heidi and Worzel Gummidge, which have gone down well. The lockdown has affected my relationships with my children. Because my daughter is working full time at home, I hardly ever see her, and when I do she is not relaxed. We no longer have outings together, and will be unable to go away for a few days together in the Autumn as we have been doing for a few years. My relationship with my son has changed completely. He is very busy as Head of a Primary school, and his wife is pregnant. I have been socially distant from them. I miss having a hug from him. I no longer go in his house or garden, but only see him and family in a public place. However, he remains a loving and concerned son, so I am fortunate. No physical contact is extremely hard when you live alone. I made the decision to hug my older grandchildren in June. Tears came to my eyes the first time I held their hands when out. I miss holding the hand of my 3 year old grandchild – my son's daughter. Her parents are worried about Spreading germs both ways. I am sad-the new grandchild should be born in October, but I doubt I will be able to handle it or even be in the same room. This is tragic. Technology I have had to learn how to use a tablet and set it up by instructions over the phone from my long suffering daughter. She has also helped me install zoom and use it. I can now initiate meetings for several people, and do a presentation with photos for zoom. I have had French lessons on zoom for 4 months-I don't like it, but better than nothing. I have 2 bookgroups via zoom, and use it to talk weekly to a close friend in Yorkshire who is having a hard time . I have had lectures from organisations on zoom which have been good-but oh, how I wish to be able go to talks in person as I used to do. I hate the fact that I never go out at night. I feel as though I am in my 80s not nearly 70 in terms of my lifestyle. I was using WhatsApp before with friends and family, however, my use of the facility to send photos has increased. We also have a street WhatsApp group which has been useful-neighbours have helped those shielding . On occasions people have bought me things I needed. I have phoned friends, especially those living alone, more often on landlines during Covid. I never use social media platforms Shopping. I tried to get online deliveries with Waitrose, Tescos, and Sainsburys. However, I am not yet 70, or on the officlal vulnerable list, although I have respiratory problems, so could not get any. I used a local company on one occasion which used to supply restaurants but, although the delivery was prompt, choice was limited and it was very expensive. My daughter then offered to buy me weekly greengrocery and bread, and top up groceries. I lent her my trolley on wheels-she does not have a car but lives very near the shops. This has worked well. My son also did 2 shopping trips for me and brought them over. At first I was very strict with myself on not eating too much-fearing I might run out of food or get fat. Lately I have been more relaxed, especially as I have now been twice to the supermarket for myself-it has been so nice to be able look and choose things. I have been cooking properly all the time. Yesterday I shared a meal outside in the garden of friends. It was a real treat to have food prepared by someone else. I have lost weight during Covid-partly stress, partly more exercise . Entertainment and Leisure I have not started anything new. I have continued to read a great deal-my own, plus two book group titles a month. I read a mixture, some modern but also classic fiction, some history/biography/popular science. I have been reading my way through the extensive library left by my husband. I access book club and foreign fiction via my kindle, and also make use of books left out on local walls. At first my concentration was poor, but I am now getting through about the same number of books as before Covid. I read French books and magazines, and listen to French podcasts. I was having French lessons via zoom until June. Again this is part of my usual activity. I have done more gardening than usual. I had a project at the beginning of lockdown to paint a couple of garden walls white. I achieved this during the hot spell, and have been delighted with the results. I doubt whether I would have accomplished this now, as I feel rather unmotivated. I have walked every day for an hour initially-latterly sometimes an hour and a half to two hours. This is not something I would have done before lockdown, although I belonged to a walking group which met monthly. Mostly I was walking to some activity and bussing back. I have really appreciated watching the trees and flowerrs emerge and change in the gardens and green spaces. I have listened to my many classical CDS. I have read several newspapers on line every day. This is different -previously I just had a Saturday newspaper. More time is spent on the phone, emails etc keeping in touch with friends . At first I did two sessions of pilates at home on my own-now just one. It is hard to keep at this. I opted out of zoom sessions with my normal class as I feel I have enough zoom activity. Besides, I can remember the exercises. I have watched far too much television. This is because I no longer go out at night. I now have a tablet and watch foreign drama series on All4 . I like art and history programmes on BBC4 and various series such as Miss America which are informative as well as entertaining. I listen to the radio during meals and kitchen preparation-usually Radio 4 , sometimes Radio 3 or classic FM. Personal Hygeine No change. However, it is boring not needing to dress for particular occasions. I have always tried to make an effort to look nice when meeting people or going out, and liked accessories such as jewellery, scarves etc. There has been no point in doing this which has been rather demoralising. Now I am seeing people I'm trying . I wear trousers and tops all the time, but at least they are different ones. Until last week I had not had a hair cut since January. It was strange to have longer hair – hadn't been that way for about 25 years. I needed to tie it back at one stage. However, following the comments of two friends that they liked my longer hair I decided to keep it longer than before. The shape of my face has changed-thinner! And I have obviously aged visually. Sleep During the initial period of the lockdown I slept very well. I think it was because there was nothing I could do-no decisions could be made about anything except food and exercise. As restictions have been limited my sleep has been disturbed. I have worried about physical symptoms – fearing all sorts of fatal illnesses. I have had to read more and more often in the middle of the night to rrelax myself, and even had to get up and make tea . I also listen to the radio, World Service and Radio 3. Recently I have had a recuurence of my breathing difficulties which have interruped my sleep too. I do not want to let insomnia get hold of me. I know it is hard to get out of this pattern. I have several friends who are chronic insomniacs. For a while after my husband died I was sleeping very badly, but had managed to cure myself of this. I try not to worry about my failure to sleep as I am aware this is counterproductive. I have not had any dreams."

Marital status: Single City: Norwich Occupation: MA Fine Art student and retail worker. Part 2: Corona Covid-19 Health: When the news of the virus broke in the winter of 2019, no-one I knew including myself really thought much of it or could have anticipated the speed and scale in which it would grip the world. As a customer facing retail worker, there were a lot of unknowns in the day to day running of store operations which would have to be edited over the coming months with new way of working put in place to accommodate this new virus and safe guard employees and customers alike. Many believed that we should close, and wait for the virus to pass, but we didn’t, and we kept on trading. Wilko seems to pride itself on remaining open to help its customers through every world event since they originally opened in 1930. So, day to day, there was little change in terms of my routine. All that happened was floor and wall stickers started to appear warning people to maintain social distancing and stay 2 meters apart, controlled numbers of shoppers and limitations on stock. Extra hand sanitiser was brought in after the shortage and people wear masks if they chose to. Luckily, nor I or nobody I know has been effected with the virus so far, although many people seem to be on the edge of a nervous break down worrying about getting ill and not being able to go outside, I go outside often now that the lockdown is over and generally I am feeling good. I find that worrying about getting ill is pointless since I have to serve the general public every day and be on the front lines so to speak, it is not really worth thinking about otherwise you probably would turn into a neurotic mess. Plus, everyone in my household is a keyworker in the retail sector and therefore constantly exposed to different people and germs so factor that into your calculations and you would never go anywhere ever. However, If I was to describe my emotions over the last few months I would say that I have pretty much been holding it together, I try and focus on my goals as much as possible and put my energy into learning new skills to distract me from feeling sad about not being about to see my family. I believe I have been productive as I finished all my MA work for term two, produced a sculptural piece for the sculpture trail and knitted a large blanket whilst being stuck at home. The only time I am allowed out is to go to work, and to do my weekly food shop. The Government: Personally, I think that the British government did well dealing with the virus as there were a lot of unknowns and misinformation spreading. I feel that all of the information they put out was straight forward and easy to follow. In the coming months I believe there will be a further ease of the lockdown regulations. News: I have been hearing the news on the car radio, I have also been watching the prime minister doing announcements online, and in newspapers as well as hearing word things at work and through word of mouth. However, I have not been watching the Governments daily 5pm press broadcast, as I feel that this is just overkill. No one I know has struggled getting access to the news as it is in so many different formats these days it’s quite readily accessible to all. If BSL wants more sign language interpreters on broadcasts then I think, let them have them as it opens up a wider audience. MO number: G6927 Gender: Female Age: 26. Marital status: Single City: Norwich Occupation: MA Fine Art student and retail worker. Work and home life: I have not been furloughed during the lockdown and have continued to work on a nearly daily bases to ensure the flow of goods from stockroom to customer. However, both my housemates have been furloughed which I believe they are pleased about as they are both worried about being at risk of infection. Nor I or anyone I live with has any children and therefore I have not had to home school anyone which I am glad of as I am not good and maths or science-based subjects. In regards to the general atmosphere of the house it hasn’t really changed much, I am the one who likes to go out anyways and when I am not out I mainly stay in my room, since it is a shared house we all mainly stay in own rooms as we all like our own space and its not a very big house. But still we all get when we see each other in the communal spaces and swap retail and lockdown stories. Technology: Since the lockdown, I have had a few conversations with my mother on WhatsApp facetime. Normally she sees it as a big social event and does her hair and make-up especially which I think is really nice, generally we talk for a couple of hours and catch up on life events and trivia. A couple of times my extended family have tried to do a quiz on zoom, which has literally been pandemonium, with people talking over each other and badly organised questions. I only participated once, and it was enough, never again. I use Facebook a bit but normally for the messenger or marketplace apps. I have been too busy day to day to really use it as a escape portal however, I am aware that many others do. Shopping and Food: The main change to my shopping rituals has just been the social distancing and queuing as well as recently the mandatory mask wearing, apart from that I have been lucky in the fact that I have been able to get everything I normally buy in the shops. I have noticed a change in behaviour slightly though which is if you are made to wait outside the shop for a long time, when you finally get in there you tend to buy more than your need as you don’t want to have to repeat that process before you really need to again. Entertainment and leisure: I have not really had an extended period of time to take up a brand-new skill so instead I have just been fine tuning my current ones. I have generally been working on my MA until I go to work, when I get home however, I usually watch some trash TV. Since the start of lockdown, I have been binge watching desperate housewives, sex and the city and other please-numb-my-brain types of programmes. I spend so much of the day thinking and analysing things, so it is nice to have the evenings off and no nothing. When I am not watching trash TV I like to watch true crime or conspiracy programmes, listen to a vast array of music or read one of my philosophical art books. MO number: G6927 Gender: Female Age: 26. Marital status: Single City: Norwich Occupation: MA Fine Art student and retail worker. Personal Hygiene: I have found that I have to make a conscious effort not to touch my face when I am at work or in public and that I wash my hands more often but that is as far as my new hygiene goes. Sleep: I have always been a good, sound sleeper and this really hasn’t changed since lockdown. Normally I am so busy in the daytime that I am eager to go to bed, and once I close my eyes, I am pretty much immediately asleep. I have quite a lot of dreams though, generally they begin right before I wake up, so that I lay there in a kind of lucid state and write the ending the way I want it. Most of my dreams are taken from real places that I frequent in my day to day life and involve people that I spend the most time with or feel most connected too, this often leads to my dreams feeling really real to me. A lot of my dreams over the last 3 or so years have been about a certain individual whom I want to be closer to, in all of these dreams I can feel their touch and it leaves me feeling soothed. Occasionally though I will have reoccurring dreams which transport me to places or landscapes I have never been to but still eerily recognise in my sleep and it will feel like de-ja-vu. Sometimes the things I dream about really do happen the way I envision them and that freaks me out a little. To me all of my dreams are interesting, but I think everyone feels that way, like they are a detective trying to crack their own code."

I moved back home from uni in London a couple of weeks before the term ended so I had a lot to do still for the first month or so, and everything felt fairly normal as my routine hadn’t changed that much, just my location. I’m also very lucky to live in a very rural area so I can go outside as much as I like as our house is surrounded by pretty much empty fields. This combined with the fact that I still had a purpose and some normality because of all the uni work I had to keep doing has been really helpful in keeping my mental health at a good level. Now I’ve finished uni it’s a bit harder because I have to keep myself occupied but I’m still pretty happy. I miss going to the theatre and seeing friends and especially my boyfriend who I haven’t seen since the beginning of March (about two months), but I’m keeping busy and spending time with my family. None of my family have been ill but we’ve all been struggling in our different ways. My dad was incredibly anxious for the first week after I came home as he felt completely out of control, and my mum has found it difficult having to give up everything she was looking forward to so has had some pretty down days. My brother is very sociable and misses going out a lot, but generally we’re coping really well and we’re in a very fortunate position. I just wish there was more I could do to help people. The Government I haven’t really been keeping up with what the government is doing because I know it will make me very anxious and depressed. I’m really disgusted by the lack of care and PPE for health workers, especially because it’s the Tories who have been underfunding and underpaying them for years ahead of this crisis that now makes life harder. I also think the decision to go into lockdown came too late, our preparation could have been so much better given what we saw happening in other countries. However I’m really glad I don’t have to be making these decisions. I really don’t know what steps will be taken over the next few months. I’m finding it difficult to imagine the future because it’s so uncertain at the moment. I imagine that travel and work restrictions will be gradually lifted, and eventually large gatherings will be allowed again and places like cinemas and theatres will reopen. I can’t see that happening for a long time though. News I haven’t been reading the news much at all, I pick up things occasionally from front pages and on social media but I don’t actively search anything out. Normally I catch some things through friends and family. I don’t want to be bombarded constantly with more of what I know will just be bad news, death and danger. Because of this, I haven’t been watching the daily government broadcasts. I haven’t heard of anyone having trouble accessing news, though it should be accessible as everything else, if not more. BSL interpretation should be used on a lot more media to make sure everyone can access it. Work and home life I haven’t been working during lockdown -I didn’t have a part-time job before despite looking for one, but I know many of my friends have been made redundant as they mostly worked in entertainment or service industries. Mass Observation Spring 2020 Directive MO number: F6959 Gender: Female Age: 19 Marital Status: single Location: London Occupation: Student Lockdown has affected my home life in that I’ve had to adapt to living with my parents and my brother again after living alone while at university. This has been alright because we normally get on fairly well, but it has been a very weird change. It has been challenging in a few minor ways, but no major disagreements have happened (yet). We’ve had to be a lot more forgiving of each other and adapt around each other. Technology I haven’t really used any new technology apart from Zoom occasionally to keep in touch with friends and getting back onto Skype. I haven’t been connecting with people as much as I’d like because I find it very difficult to initiate conversations -there are lots of people that I miss but don’t think I know well enough to reach out to. I’m also very self-sufficient so I’m used to being on my own. I really miss just hanging out with people in groups though. I’m finding social media a bit more comforting than normal, I like seeing what people post especially when they’re posting more than normal or just about things they normally wouldn’t to distract from what’s going on. It’s very comforting knowing that people are still there, and we’re all going through this together even if we can’t see each other in person. Shopping and food I haven’t been shopping since I came home, mostly because I don’t have a car and there’s no way to get to a shop near us without driving. It also seems pointless to go with someone when most shops would only allow one of us in anyway. When I have gone out, it’s been very stressful and weird. I found food shopping on my own stressful anyway, so now the added challenge of having to avoid people makes it a lot more difficult. My eating habits have definitely changed but that’s mostly because I’m no longer just cooking for myself as I was at university -I eat what my family eats which is pretty different from what I was eating when I was living on my own. When I was living alone I was pretty much vegetarian but now I eat a lot more meat to make things easier when we’re cooking together. I’m baking a lot more too, which is really nice as it’s something I enjoy. I now bake a cake or brownies or something similar once every five days or so. Entertainment and leisure I haven’t really taken up any new skills or hobbies but I have been helping my parents with some DIY and in the garden. I have been developing my baking skills and I plan to learn Russian with my dad soon. Mostly I’ve been reading a lot of books, my favourites since lockdown started have been Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Girl Woman Other by Bernadine Evaristo and Hero of Ages by Brandon Sanderson. Fiction is a really comforting place for me at the moment. I’ve also been watching a lot of theatre live streams online, mostly from the National Theatre as that was one of my favourite places to go before lockdown and they’re showing some amazing shows from their back catalogue of National Theatre Live productions. My favourites have been One Man Two Guvnors and Frankenstein. Mass Observation Spring 2020 Directive MO number: F6959 Gender: Female Age: 19 Marital Status: single Location: London Occupation: Student Personal Hygiene I have definitely been showering less often since lockdown started, just because I find it hard to get motivated to look after myself. This doesn’t bother me much though I know I should try and keep up normality as much as possible. Sleep I haven’t had any trouble sleeping particularly, but I have been having some weird dreams, mostly consisting of situations where I’m trying to keep away from people but I end up in a massive crowd of people who don’t seem to care about distancing, which I then can’t get out of."

It was not too difficult at first as we are retired and we cannot do a great deal because of my husband’s mobility issues. However it has become more depressing as time has gone on. Mainly missing grandchildren, who although are not small, are rapidly growing up and I am close to my grandson who will become a teenager later this year. I do wonder if we are growing apart, which would happen in the normal scheme of things. Have decided that we have to make the best of things and have spent more time in the garden growing vegetables. Not something I usually do but as we are tied to the house I am here to look after them which is time consuming.  Have felt more depressed in the last few weeks. My husband would like to go out but he is on the shielding list so really should not go out until June. Not that we ever did much, but it is starting to feel like house arrest. The numbers of infected people and the mortality rate has declined in recent days so that does give some hope for the future. Getting my husband’s medication delivered has been a nightmare. Decided to order online for it to be delivered by post. However the online pharmacy has been overwhelmed with order and it has been impossible to get through to them on the phone. It has literally taken hours. However they did arrive in the end and now waiting for next months order. The government Political decision making has been woeful and the news this week is that 75% of deaths may have been avoided if lockdown was introduced just a week earlier. I could not believe it when Johnson postponed lockdown citing again and again ‘the best scientific advice.’ They had only to look at what was developing in Italy to see that they needed to lockdown sooner rather than later. Time and time again they have been slow to act. Slow at cancelling incoming flights, slow at the lockdown, slow at introducing track and trace. Even the lockdown was half hearted with nothing like as stringent regulations as in some other countries. The rest of the world are looking on and are aghast as our mortality and infection rates. They are shameful. In the coming months the government will try to get the economy moving again. But people are fearful. They are trying to get schools to reopen to some year groups on the 1 June but unions and some parents are against it.  They should have negotiated a return with the input of the unions and other teaching bodies. But they didn’t. Poor communication and management. News I am reading The Guardian, The Mail on line and following news items on Twitter and Dr. John Campbell on YouTube. I also listen to BBC 1 News at Ten. I have been watching the daily news briefings. The briefings initially were a way of getting some sort of handle on what was going on in the government. However they have become mundane and repetitive. I now usually listen to BBC Radio 4 and only make an effort to watch if there’s a current issue that I am interested in. Johnson has been noticeable by his absence. In fact he is absent from all forms of media. Since I started this response, Johnson has appeared at todays briefing to defend Cummings who has been blatantly defying the lockdown rules. Johnson defense was nothing short of a car crash. There’s nothing to defend, why not just apologise and move on? But no, the arrogance of this shower is the only remarkable feature they have. There is a furious storm on Twitter. Will Cummings resign? I doubt it. I have not issues with accessing the news. Our television has the facility for audio description and also text so there should not be a problem for the vast majority of people. Work and home life. I am retired so less affected than others. Basically our way of life is not much different except we have no interaction that would normally enrich our daily lives. For instance meeting with friends or seeing family. We have also had to cancel a holiday at Easter with our grandchild. However one of our adult children has recently brought a grandchild to see us, we have been socially isolated in the garden, keeping the recommended distance. This has helped a lot. Technology Have just ordered an Alexa as this might be useful for my husband to listen to books as he can not see well enough to read. I have started a short online music course with Harvard University. Have only used WhatApp to keep in touch with adult children. Have texted grandchildren and spoken to them over the phone. I use Facebook to keep in touch with local groups and it has been very useful for local information. I have also joined a couple of Facebook gardening groups. I guess the only people in the world who would be a bit interested in my photos of roses. I have started with Instagram but don’t use it a great deal as the moment. Shopping/food Getting online delivery slots took a lot of time initially. As my husband is being shielded I decided to avoid shops altogether. Before lockdown I did ensure that the store cupboard had enough to get us through an initial couple of weeks. It is still impossible to get self raising flour for some reason. I think that I am baking more, as we cannot go out, but not a great deal as you just end up eating more than you would need. I am buying a fruit and veg box from a local farm that is delivered to the door and the produce is very fresh. The only problem is that you get what’s in the box so don’t get to choose what you would like. Had artichokes this week which I would usually avoid. By the time you have finished prepping there’s little left and they don’t seem worth the effort. Entertaining/leisure Well I have mentioned gardening and the online short music course. I did intend to read more but this has not happened. I do keep busy and rarely sit down during the day. I have a dog and walk with her every day and now we are allowed to go out as often as we would like so I am taking her for a short walk later too. I also like to paint and have bought a couple of books online to give some inspiration and new dimension. Personal hygiene I did stop washing my hair every day and left it to every other day. However it makes me feel even more depressed when it’s a mess so I have resumed daily washing in the shower. Apart from that habits are the same. The main this is not being able to visit a hairdresser! Our local salon owner posted on Facebook that she was taking bookings for when they re-open. I put my name down so hopefully will have to get a cut when they are back in business. I would guess that would be in July. I bought some hairclippers for my husband when all this first started. He did have a very short crop but it has grown back. I think that he’s a bit wary of me having another go, but it is getting a bit long again. Sleep I have long term problems with sleep but I have had a couple of nights when I just have been able to get back to sleep at all. This is very unusual. I have not been having nightmares. I did dream that I was on holiday with my grandchildren, in a beautiful part of the world and I was taking some photos. I haven’t seen some of them for 3 months and I am missing them. I felt deeply melancholic when I woke as it was such a contrast with the happiness in the dream."

He was treated for sepsis and recovered well, returning home after 2 night’s stay. Other than that, none of the family have had any physical issues. Mentally, there have been a few matters of concern: My youngest son didn’t want to go out at all at the beginning of Lockdown. His little mind had drawn a picture of empty streets and this had frightened him, so he didn’t want to see it. We managed to tackle it by asking him to write himself a letter and come for a walk to post it. Luckily, there were people about and they all said Hello, so his concerns lifted. For me, I have struggled sometimes to have time for myself. Also, my husband and I have differing views of the world and I find myself often angry and frustrated at the views he holds. I cope with this by taking a walk alone and regularly speaking to a counsellor online. I also practice self-care so will speak to friends, have a bath, draw, journal, paint and write if I am having difficulty. For the first few weeks of lockdown I felt very relaxed. I find the school run stressful (too much of a rush and many people to acknowledge and say Hello to) and have not had to do that. I usually find housework a thankless task but, as we have all been here, I have enjoyed getting up early and tidying the house. As the weeks have passed the focus on home-schooling increased and I became concerned that I may be failing my children somewhat by not enforcing it. This is compounded by the children’s teachers sending emails every week celebrating the efforts of other children (not mine) when there has never been any explicit instruction that children should be following any sort of schooling routine. I have difficulty assessing political decisions. At first, I felt our politicians were giving us an element of freedom to make our own decisions based on the data presented and I felt comfortable with that. Then other people started behaving erratically, buying up all the stock in shops, flocking to beaches and places of interest despite warnings to stay indoors. There was also a factor of NHS frontline staff not receiving adequate protective equipment to ensure their own safety when treating patients with Covid19. I don’t feel able to blame our politicians for the failings here. They are just human like the rest of us, despite some people thinking they should be otherwise. I have never been a blamer unless I am confident that deliberate mistakes were made. I don’t think that’s the case here at all, however I know other people feel very angry and let down. Initially, I watched the Government press broadcasts. I enjoyed watching them and felt it was a good way to stay properly informed. As time has gone on, I find them boring and prefer to get information from the Government email that I have subscribed to. It tells of action being taken and legislation being introduced to tackle the virus. I feel I am aware first-hand of what is being done, but I am less inclined to read every bit of the email now we are in week ten or eleven of Lockdown. I think having a BSL interpreter at these briefings present a very inclusive picture for those who are hearing-impaired, and I agree this is a good thing. I was furloughed near the beginning of Lockdown. My contracted hours at this time of year are 8 per week, however the company I work for are assessing the hours I worked at the same time last year and if it was greater than 8 hours then they are paying that amount. I think this is fair. In the first weeks my employer was in touch regularly and I felt included and remembered. As the time has passed this is less so. I put this down to my direct manager not feeling I want to be disturbed too much as I have kids to deal with. This isn’t the case however and I do wish he would check with me before making that assumption. Home schooling is horrible. The relationship I have with my children is relatively relaxed. I prefer them to see home as their sanctuary; a place where they can discover what they enjoy doing and do it. They do not enjoy a schoolwork and I am not a great believer in too much formal education, so I am at odds. Nevertheless, I have a responsibility as their parent to do the best I can for them, despite my beliefs, so I currently tackle home-schooling every other day. The days in-between are for them to relax and enjoy their time at home, with us – their parents. I have found connecting with friends and work colleagues using Whatsapp and Zoom to be beneficial. I am a people person and like regular interaction with others. I am used to seeing people face to face and generally like a hug with my nearest and dearest so there has been an adjustment. I don’t use Facebook as I find it a platform for the loudest and most ignorant shouters on the block. Twitter has its uses and I sometimes like to see what others are saying about the current situation. There does seems to be a pattern to the people on Twitter though: those who pick up on every piece of controversy and pull the politically correct card, trying to be everyone’s friend; those who kick off and take offence as the slightest thing and sound off (usually completely uninformed) for all to hear; those who just whinge and moan about how hard it all is and, thankfully!, some people who are sensible, rational and have something factual and interesting to say. To reach the latter there can be a stream of the former to go through though. This is both very draining and time-consuming. There was a shortage of food and essentials, like toilet roll, during the first few weeks of Lockdown. This didn’t really worry me as we shopped for what was available and worked our way around it. I didn’t worry too much as I felt sure supply chains would get through and the supermarkets would re­stock as soon as they could. When my son was in hospital, we arranged an online shop; it came on time and was correct. Other than that, my husband has been shopping weekly. Some things (particularly yeast and flour) have not been in stock for a while but are gradually returning now that we are further along. I have made myself a studio in my house. I hadn’t planned to do this before as I am usually at work, out with friends or focusing on my husband and the children, so the need was not apparent. I have discovered a desire for decorating greeting cards, taking instant photos, sticking inspirational quotes on the wall and surrounding my space with keepsakes: a picture of my late Dad, photos of the kids, a picture of me in my twenties looking happy and carefree, paper butterflies and flowers. These are all concentrated in my studio that, in fact, is a tiny unused corner of my utility room. It is bright and near the back door which I often have open to hear the birdsong. It is a happy space and a good legacy of the Lockdown. I have also used my Kindle tablet to watch films that I know the rest of the family will not enjoy. Keeping clean is a bit of an issue as I often can’t remember if I showered or bathed the day before. In the mornings I relax and then schoolwork takes precedence so there is not always adequate time. Sometimes I will take myself off for a bath in the evening after dinner while my husband and kids watch quiz shows that I do not like. I usually don’t go more than 2 days before showering or bathing though. I enjoy washing my long hair and straightening it and usually do it whenever I have time, otherwise I tie it up in a messy fashion which is fine and looks ok. I am not a good sleeper at the best of times. I suffer from anxiety and often wake in the night to go over the day’s events and what I could’ve, should’ve, would’ve said or done better. During Lockdown however there are not so many interactions with people I don’t know, so there are no events to bring on these concerns. I have slept through many nights and mostly wake up feeling refreshed. My dreams are usually filled by difficult scenarios with my mother, brother and the wife of my late brother, who have not spoken to me for nearly 3 years. I wake up realising that I am better off without them in my life. Sometimes I spend time with characters from the TV or YouTube shows my kids watch. That is odd as these presenters are in their early twenties and crazy mad – perhaps I am regressing. The children generally sleep well. My eldest wakes up in the night sometimes when things that have happened at school upset or confuse him. Again, this is not the case now as he isn’t there, so it is all good. We are fortunate, as a family, to live in a house we love, with super neighbours around us, in a location we adore. Things have not always been this way for us, and we have often thought about how Lockdown would’ve been in our former home. It would have been very different, and our struggles would have been much worse."

Last occupation Craft Shop Owner Health We have had no physical health issues during the lock down period and have not required any medical or professional help. My emotions have been mixed over the last three or four weeks mainly because I feel getting back to 'normal' is never going to happen. It is quite frightening to have nameless fears with no reassurance of an end point. I think we have forgotten that we can live without fear. At first it was a novel experience staying at home but tension seems to have increased now we are coming out of lockdown. I don't like the way that people (mostly strangers) are physically keeping their distance, stepping off the pavement and avoiding eye contact. There is such an air of suspicion and general nervousness. It feels as if our whole world has shrunk to nothing. I worry that we will not be able to live as freely as we once did. Everything seems to have changed completely in such a comparatively short time. Sometimes it's hard not to feel depressed and panicky. I don't feel worried and depressed just for myself, although it has curtailed a lot of the things we hoped to do in retirement, but more for the future of my children and grandchildren. How will life be for them in the future? The Government The government information has been confusing in that all the countries of the UK are not working together. In Scotland we are on a different timescale for emerging from lockdown. It seems unlikely that the leaders of neighbouring countries which have no physical borders should be so different in their viewpoints and choices. There has been too much general information which appears not to have been honed down to workable practices. I would have liked to see the Prime Minister and First Ministers working together to present a united front. I feel I am not qualified to comment on most of the political decisions that have been made. It has been an enormous challenge for them all and, as they keep telling us, we are all in this together. Whatever political decisions have been made will hopefully have been the right decisions at the time. It would have been more reassuring if the decisions made had been cross-party decisions. Now, if ever, is the time for a coalition government. I imagine that the government will be basing their next decisions on re-booting the economy. I hope the emphasis on protecting the NHS will continue and the social welfare aspects will not be forgotten. Education may well be in for a complete overhaul and employment and benefits and travel will undoubtedly be on the agenda. I have no idea how the government will cope with it all. News Wherever I have lived, either in England or Scotland, I feel the news is always London-centric. If it isn't happening in London it isn't happening! City dwelling is vastly different to rural dwelling or living in smaller towns and cities and each presents different problems. Journalists, whether writing for BBC, ITV, SKY, or any of the other news channels or daily newspapers are mainly commenting and reporting on what happens in the capital. Regional news takes second place and is usually patronising. I read a national newspaper daily and watch the main news on television. I do not rely on social media for news apart from information on Facebook posted by our community council and a Facebook page for our local volunteers. These Facebook pages have been informative and unbiased and tell us things we need to know. I have occasionally watched the 5pm daily government briefing broadcasts but do not watch them regularly. There is often too much conflicting information between what is happening in England and what is happening in Scotland. I don't support the SNP but Nicola Sturgeon's broadcasts are clearer, relevant and more concise. I do not know anyone who has experienced difficulty accessing news but I would definitely support the use of a BSL interpreter. Work and Home Life My husband and myself are both retired so we have no work practices which have been affected. A life unencumbered by working hours is entirely different. You have to make your own structure for your daily life so what was in place for us needed little adaptation. I did notice that my husband re-structured his day by being in his workshop almost on a 9-5 basis as if he was in an office job! My day, whether in lockdown or not, is structured anyway around mealtimes, washing and cleaning. Although the impact on our home life has been minimal, the biggest difficulty has been not seeing our daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren regularly. We have been unable to see them as we would normally have done for outings, birthdays and social occasions or helped with childcare. This has been a strain on us and them. We were not able to help much with home schooling either. The educational aspect of lockdown has been worrying for us all. Although we live only 15 miles apart we have stuck to the rules throughout but the lack of their physical presence has been challenging. Having relatives and friends living abroad has also been distressing, knowing that we are not free to travel. We have no pets currently but have considered getting a dog. Technology Keeping in touch with family and friends had been mainly by telephone, texts, WhatsApp or video calls via Facebook or Facetime. This was not new to us so it has not been difficult. We have used Zoom regularly, at least once a week for Craft Club meetings, Book Group meetings and Rotary Club meetings. Zoom was new to us but we have found it easy to use and very ueful. We will probably continue to use it in the future. We have never used Twitter or Instagram. Shopping and food During lockdown we reduced our weekly shopping food trip to shopping about every 10 or 14 days. For the first four or five weeks my husband went out to do the shopping so that I need not go out. I was not officially medically shielding but as I had just had major surgery a few months ago we felt it was better for me to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Eventually we went back to me doing the shopping and we now often go together. No food shopping has been done on line and we have used our usual supermarkets. We didn't stockpile as we keep a reasonable store of tinned and frozen food as we live in a rural community with no local shops apart from a small convenience store. A variety of local suppliers, baker, milk man, butcher, fishmonger, garden centre and farm shop all arranged deliveries to our village. Most deliveries were free or the businesses made a small charge. We used the butcher and farm shop for fresh meat and vegetables a few times to support local businesses and the garden centre for seeds and compost. Normally we would not have used deliveries but we appreciated the efforts local tradespeople made to keep their businesses going. We found that we ate more than usual and never skipped a meal, presumably because we were confined to the house and had more time to spend on cooking and eating. Every meal was a social occasion! Because we were at home more we watched more television in the evenings and also had more snacks, i.e. crisps or nuts. Normally we have a healthy diet but found we were eating more 'comfort foods' such as cakes and puddings. It felt as though cooking or baking was sometimes the main (or only) achievement of the day. There were very few occasions when we missed meals because we were in a hurry or had something better to do. We were never in a hurry and rarely had something better to do! Entertainment and Leisure We have done many, many DIY jobs during lockdown. Unfortunately they were not always the ones that were necessary or important but mainly small jobs such as sanding and repainting a cupboard, repairing a chair, painting kitchen stools, re-organising and rearranging my sewing room and my husband's workshop. The big projects which we were hoping to do included building an en suite shower room, refurbishing an old bathroom and replacing the kitchen. Plans were in place to do all these but it was impossible to obtain building materials or to employ the necessary tradesmen. They are still waiting to be started and it has been and still is, a constant source of frustration and dissatisfaction as we haven't been able to complete these house renovations. They are still waiting and although we can now get building supplies we can't get anyone to do the work. If we could have done it ourselves we would have but we don't have the necessary skills. Almost every evening before dinner my husband and I have had a perpetual challenge game of Rumicub, a board game that we usually play with the family. We have done crosswords daily but no jigsaws or computer games. We have enjoyed sharing more conversation as we have had more time to talk to each other. My husband has done some model railway modelling and I have completed some old unfinished projects of crochet and embroidery plus learning new skills of gel plate printing and watercolour painting. Luckily we had most of the equipment needed for those hobbies -purchased long before lockdown -so there have been a few little creative triumphs. Photo attached of an embroidery started and finished during lockdown with appropriate annotation! Our exercise level has remained much the same apart from doing much more gardening than usual, including growing more vegetables than we would normally grow (an underlying worry about possible shortages of food!) We have been watching more or less the same type of television programmes that we would normally watch, dramas, thrillers, quiz games, etc. and pretty soon we started actively avoiding programmes about corona virus. There was far too much conflicting information on the pandemic to disseminate and much of it was very frightening when you are isolated from family and friends. We began to feel very useless and ineffectual sitting at home. The radio (BBC radio 2) is on all day and the BBC have been excellent in their programme content apart from the Jeremy Vine show which has been composed of more than the usual ignorant and sensationalist content. That particular programme contributed a great deal to cause me stress and worry with its constant and unremitting daily focus on the downside of Covid-19. Reading material has not changed from the usual fiction although I have read far less than normal. I have no idea why as it has always been my way of relaxation. Perhaps subconsciously I couldn't let myself relax. Lockdown has caused a lot of tension. Personal hygiene I don't think this has really changed. My daily personal care routine has been comforting -one thing that has not been affected by lockdown. Hair care has been difficult as I wear my hair short and I'm desperate to have it cut into a decent style again. I've chopped bits off! My husband has grown a beard, which I really dislike. He says he will shave it off when the pubs open. I can't wait! I gave him a haircut so he looked less like a hobo. He complained. Sleep Neither of us had had a particular problem with sleeping during lockdown. We have had a lot of fresh air (mostly when gardening) and have occupied ourselves without being bored. Generally we have tried to achieve something positive every day which seems to have helped. Both of us have had more dreams than usual but none really disturbing and no nightmares. I have lain awake longer than usual several times but that has been mainly due to the light summer nights. I actively try not to worry irrationally at night and use relaxation techniques and listen to music if I need to get to sleep."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health It’s interesting reflecting on health because its constantly being talked about but on a day to day basis everyone is trying to get on with their lives. P went into a very silent mode when Greece announced although they would be reopening for visitors they would not be welcoming UK visitors. It’s one thing to know your own Government is doing a terrible job, its another to be seen as unclean and so banned from travel. It wasn’t the whole reason for his low mood, all the other aspects of Covid are hardly laughing matters but that tiny bit of hope taken away is hard to take. We are very privileged but of course its out of our control. That insecurity and lack of trust in the Government in their poor action and lack of good faith. It’s hard to just live with as there is nothing we can do. We have avoided injury or serious illness, apart from Covid at the beginning and apart from Mum who has somehow caused her wrist to swell and had lovely help over the phone from the Doctor and repeat prescriptions delivered we have been here at home. Various friends have had to go to A &E OR fracture clinic and I had an ultrasound just before lockdown was imposed. All swift efficient in empty hospitals or collecting prescriptions from silent medical centres with patient silent queues. I have kept busy, lambing gardening filling the background with audiobooks and concentrated actions has kept it all at bay fairly successfully. Have been supporting friends who are struggling and have friends and family who are sheilded (although after yesterdays total b******** who knows where they stand now. We are told at the beginning 1:3 were frightened by Covid but now it 1:6 and the debacle of Dominic bloody Cummings and the subsequent rapid release from lockdown without tests being met has not helped. Pictures yesterday fo Durdle Dor where 100s were crammed on a beach which was then packed even tighter as the air ambulance landed to pick up two seriously injured fools who had been tombstoning off the top. No chance of social distancing there, and tomorrow schools go back. Mine actually will not open its doors to non key workers and non vulnerable children A month later before formal opening on 4 July everyone had turned up at Bournemouth beaches today and yesterday its that no one seems able to recognise there is not yet an established normal and that the previous normal is not coming back anytime soon, if ever and if we do not work with some sort of wiser restraint we will be back under lockdown or whatever idea the Government can come up with and it does not have to be like this. We could start to reestablish a version of stable normality if we kept some working rules but there are really no absolutes for preventing spread except no contact and if we do that we’ll have not an economy. Its time to think differently and plan differently and yet so many people seem to want to just go back to their previous normal pretend none of this has happened, is happening. So health, superficially all fine and yet I cannot read a book for long, I fill my ears with audiobooks, podcasts or radio programmes, this is a very successful way of stopping thinking, one I have always used but the fact I cannot read a book or concentrate on research indicates to me that the worry about the instability and uncertain times is just buried under the surface. The children had a big row about a minor thing tonight the first in lockdown and P ended up upset. I know he is hugely worried about everything but I had not realised how worried I just bury myself and separate from the worries but P is clearly stewing. We can go to Salcombe for a break in 2 weeks and that will help i think but with the uncertainty unlikely to end we all need small changes to stay sane. I think we are all the same its not a long holiday from normal life, its a long absence from everyday life with no idea of exactly what comes next and how it will all look this week, next week, next month, next year. We are not used to such uncertainty and instability and we seem not to cope well with this; either bury out heads or stay angry and scared. Neither are healthy. Teaching children this week I have realised just how much they need each other they need the routine of school of the boring the mundane and the fun: the surety of Monday, the clearly defined holidays and weekends. They do not always love it, we do not always love work or getting up to go but the absence of it all is a form of limbo. Most have some level of worry about their lives or the future and that adds a subtext to everything subconsciously and consciously often children just read the subtext of worry and school is the safe place. Currently, this is not available to them. So at every level the world is unsafe and insecure. For us all. And nobody’s health benefits from uncontrolled and unpredictable, insecurity. For us lambing gave a clear frame and for H farming carries on doing this. J is still bucking the trend by being far happier working from home than actually at school and he illustates the other side. I have a dear friend who is getting divorced from a bully, has a boss who is a bully and has found the last year so hard. Being on lockdown and on furlough has given her breathing space and time to regain some balance and perspective. I think she will find she has more energy to cope with resolving the divorce and deciding what to do about work. She looks well and happier than she has in a very long time. So I suspect for some the mental health issues of Covid will be more about the effects on their health of returning to a more normal highly stressed life. I suspect hindsight will teach us much. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I think this Government is careless, arrogant, selfserving, dishonest, fraudulent and so bothered about brexit and power it is currently demolishing our democracy and allowing excess deaths of their citizens. It is complicit in creating conditions that almost guarantee a second wave of significant proportions for which they are unprepared and unwilling to discuss preparing for and have been shown to give huge multimillion £ contracts to companies with turnovers of £18K and their only experience in pest control. In having a ‘special adviser’ the puppetmaster rasputin, of his day Cummings, pulling their strings. He was art of the group who resisted lockdown eventually capitulating based on flawed modelling from Imperial who had not updated their doubling data to reflect the Italian experience which showed doubling time was far shorter than the 5 days we were working on, so delayed lockdown too long 356 deaths as opposed to Germany’s 63. Cummings who helped set the lockdown rules then runs from London, knowing he is infected and so is his wife up the M1 No doubt stopping to infect a few at petrol stations and toilets with their 5 year old. He then went for a jolly to Barnard Castle to test his eyes drove his son and wife for 30 mins to test his eyes. And of course he did not resign. He is holding them all up and driving brexit. The Covid crisis is of course unprecedented but it is unprecedented that our Governments approach has resulted in the terrible funding for the NHS over 10 years, the lack of PPE including not joining the EU PPE scheme and lying about it being offered. They cannot even admit when they have made a decision they spin they lie they twist and fundamentally they do not care if they cared at all we would have more confidence. Worst of all we have 4 more years of these idiot wreckers. They are demolishing our rights, our lives, they are pushing brexit when out economy is destroyed they want to destroy the UK and there seems to be nothing at all we can do. I lobby I write, I tweet, and I sign the petitions but the hope is so tenuous. It’s all so hard to not just give into despair. On top of that people seem to fail to understand that if our Government does not want to protect us we must protect ourselves. Masks -why not, social distance maintain it for us all. The vulnerable and shielded we need to protect. It is simple the virus is her to stay, it cannot be corralled and made to disappear so instead we must live with it. But be honest and truthful about it all and this Government’s inability to tell the truth about anything from testing numbers to their 5 tests to real R numbers means the population who are thinkgin feel lost alone abandoned and very vulnerable. I hope I am being pessimistic, I fear I am not. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? New Scientist CEBM -Oxford Covid research Centre The Zoe Covid recording app and webinars Twitter for headlines then drill deep for facts and fake news. On line Independent and Guardian, Byline Times Tortoise No radio no TV for news Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. No rapidly recognised picking splinters of truth from a cascade of dishonest spin was not good for my health. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? If you are a member of the electorate in this country you should be able to see whatever the Government are saying so yes of course. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. My work stopped the Friday before lockdown when schools closed for all but key worker and vulnerable children. I have missed it although in the early weeks helping with lambing and the animals kept me pretty busy. Shopping takes so long when going for neighbours too and food for 6 adults is interminable. P has been at home since Wed before. He finds the lack of split between home and work hard. He has regular wellbeing sessions with his team and its hard. They are doing rolling furloughs across the firm to make it equal for all but his group are at 80% with a full workload so working at 120%. If I had been depending on my income this would have been a very lean time. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? It has been amazing to have all the children home for one last time and also my son’s lovely girlfriend who has been helping him. Generally it has been a really happy time with everyone getting on and enjoying more time with fewer pressures. Surprisingly, mostly we have had few arguments and lots of shared time. We have had more meals together than ever before and more chats debates and discussions. It is unlikely all these adults will live together for more than the odd week ever again as they will be making their own lives. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? We started coffee twice a week on whatsapp and that happens most weeks and although it usually takes 3 attempts to get D, M and M and I on all together it works well. I have also been doing hit and Pilates online through teams and a prerecorded one with my Rowing Pilates teacher on You tube. I have had Governors meetings on Teams where one participant is always upside down or sideways on! It has generally worked well and my husband has found the same. I have joined webinars on various platforms and attended mediation on zoom. I miss real people now but its better than not doing it and I prefer the live versions as you can chat afterwards which in strict lockdown was a release. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I could not be bothered with getting up at 1 in the morning to book slots so as we though we had had Covid, once quarantine was over I have shopped every week. For the first few weeks things changed every time as we were given rules on one way shopping woebetide you if you forget -queues , only pick once -impossible in choosing a ripe avocado! And the constant dance to keep 2m and get your stuff. Knowing you are stuck in a one way route means every shopping list has to be clear and accurate. K has helped immeasurably to shop and cook and plan. The boys have done the odd bit. P more. We have fish,milk and fresh bread deliveries as well as veg boxes -these have a narrower choice but I was so glad I was a long term customer and could get a slot. Bread is new and the bakery are amazing. Brunos in Studley including delivering a high cream tea for my Mum’s birthday. We all baked loads in the early weeks, which was unfortunate as flour disappeared for many many week completely and only became a permanent feature in supermarkets about 3 weeks ago -10/11 weeks into lockdown. Local stores managed to get some a bit earlier from local mills. My neighbours who I shop for want Marmite -but yeast is still in very short supply 14 weeks on and so no marmite. Shopping for 3 neighbours us and my parents meant I volunteered poor K to help. My parents have gone back to shopping in full PPE this week.. I went back to work so am now wearing a mask in public places Supported local shops, the book shop, the butcher, the sewing shop the milkman and the veggie suppliers. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I have been making a tepee and face masks on my sewing machine. I have painted a little , read a little, listened to hours of audio. Read too much twitter and taken long breaks from twitter. Read and watched science about the virus, taken breaks from that. Watched a few series and a few films gardened,tidied and cleaned, cooked and cooked. And spun though days with little to show for it. Done some of my course, planned some sessions for anxious children, worked on the school garden and school display, talked to friends and FaceTimed, taken classes and undertaken online seminars. Often managed to be remarkable solitary in a house full of people all doing their own thing. Avoided music as it is always about emotion and feeling and so too much brain free flow. I have filled my time as much as I can whilst still having days of total idleness.. loved sewing bee, black history programmes, a house through time, and that ridiculous J Lion thingy on Netflix at the beginning of lockdown. Reruns of familiar books or series. Safety stuff. Also read Ann Prachett The Dutch house -I loved and factfulness to keep me sane, Georgette Heyer, Nagio Marsh and Dorothy L Sayers, Cabin Pressure (John Finnemore) silly videos of people in lockdown. For sanity in the numbers Radio 4.s More or Less is unbeaten facts and detail. Old Desert Island Discs. Podcasts, Fortunately -Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Katherine Ryan, various others. Tonight bat watching more wildlife watching studying landscape and seasons as we walk the dog twice a day. Learning more plants and a bit of low level eco action preventing gather verges from being mowed and identifying the species and hedgerow condition. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? No not really. I suppose less occasion to wear make up. I get dressed to walk the dog so have to get up which is good I think. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. P and I have had vivid dreams and I have always had the odd insomnia night -i listen to audiobooks and go with it. Not much different to normal that I recall. P has definitely had more vivid dreams than I have and can recall them, whereas mine dissolve as I wake i think.

Iâ€™ve had adifferent commitment emerge in that twice a week I cover break times for my disabled brotherâ€™s livein carer while he cannot attend his day centre. But even that, another brother will cover if I fancydoing something else. Itâ€™s been harder to keep track of the days of the week and the date.When we were in lockdown (and to some extent now) time seemed to extend each day butsimultaneously weeks seemed to pass by quickly. My husband and I followed government advice tomostly   stay at home, apart from daily exercise and shopping trips. As we have a garden andallotment, we spent lots of time on them. The absence of many elements of daily life, includingsocialising, meant that I was more aware of seasonal changes. In particular I did walks with mydisabled brother while his carer had a break and the trees were just coming into leaf when lockdownbegan. We observed them coming into full leaf and the seasonal changes to vegetation and berries.Iâ€™ve observed the seasons in more detail. I am writing a nature journal every few weeks which Istarted last summer, so observing the detail is not an entirely new to me, but it has become morepronounced. Iâ€™ve become more interested in learning the names of the trees, flowers and birds that Isee in the countryside.My husband and myself have been more creative during lockdown, starting with making a rainbowto put in our window to show support for the NHS. We watched Greyson Perryâ€™s Art Club on TV anddid some paintings and drawings on the themes he suggested. My husband has creating a 2020commemorative tea towel as Perry did, with coronavirus themed pictures on it (e.g. Amazon vans).Weâ€™ve   also done more decorating and garden projects, including creating a little beach at home witha boat shaped seat, seaside plants, gravel and pebbles for times we canâ€™t go to the actual beach.At the beginning of the pandemic I was sleeping very badly with vivid dreams, as I adjusted to thestrange new situation, I think. I let myself sleep in if Iâ€™d had a sleepless night as I didnâ€™t usually haveto  get up for anything in particular. This has led to a less regulated sleep pattern which at some pointIâ€™d like to get into a more usual waking and sleeping times. Itâ€™s a bit like being on holiday all the timeif you put aside for a minute that you are in the midst of a pandemic!My rhythms havenâ€™t changed a great deal since lockdown was eased. We are doing some socialisinghaving friends visit in the garden and eating and drinking on outside tables at pubs and cafes, butSxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B7084.pdfmostly still doing home based things as we are being cautious with our health and that of others. Wedid take a short break in a holiday cottage in Wales, choosing a place than is in the middle ofnowhere in a former monastery. It was nice to go somewhere different even for a short while.Something that has changed is that Iâ€™ve more frequently made car journeys to meet friends who livefurther afield to go walking together. Iâ€™ve also met family members and local friends for walks whenwe would normally spend time indoors together.In my homelife, things have to some extent followed a routine, but a very relaxed one. We havetended to eat later in the evening than we previously did, sometimes later than is ideal if the dinnertook a long time to cook. Iâ€™ve been trying to get into a routine of walking 10,000 steps most days ofthe week, in an attempt to counteract all the over eating and wine drinking of earlier lockdowntimes. I tend to do this later in the day as it has been very hot and I take our dog who wouldotherwise get overheated. So, I typically go out about 6pm or so and get back around an hour and ahalf later, then eat dinner. My husband has been volunteering to cook dinner while Iâ€™m out, butotherwise we donâ€™t have to negotiate time with each other.I donâ€™t anticipate great changes to timings in the future, although I will try to get up a bit earlier andeat earlier in the evening, I donâ€™t feel any sense of urgency about this. At some point my voluntarycommitments will resume but I feel in no hurry to take them back up while coronavirus is stillcirculating.Media and technology have payed a more prominent part in my life. I have regular zoom get-togethers with a particular group of friends and the occasional one with another couple. Early on wetried joint WhatsApp calls for myself and three sisters, but as we all spoke at once it wasnâ€™t toosuccessful. We now have WhatsApp written chats instead. I started a family photo album onWhatsApp where we share mainly old photos with all different generations of the family andreminisce.  We also have a family news group for more urgent thigs, such as when one sister becamevery unwell (not with coronavirus). We have also had a few calls with the Houseparty App friendsbut they seem to have fallen off in favour of texts and meeting in person. I think I now keep in bettertouch with people who do not live nearby or who I donâ€™t normally see too often, although it is notquite the same as seeing them in person.I spend more time on my I phone looking at Facebook and playing scrabble with a sister and a friend.I still use a paper diary and calendar as I normally do but nowadays forget to look at them so notvery effective. I put reminders on my phone of things I want to get done so I donâ€™t forget aboutthem.I get a text when my prescriptions are due so donâ€™t have to visit the pharmacy and possibly queue,until I know they are waiting for me which is helpful. Iâ€™ve had a e-appointment with my doctor whichI really liked. It avoided a visit to the surgery and I was able to get the advice and information Ineeded without seeing the GP. I helped my husband when he was due to have a hospitaldermatology appointment to follow him up after a melanoma two years ago. It was changed to atelephone/online appointment and I took photos of skin areas for them to look at and check inadvance      of the appointment. In the end the apportionment was cancelled because of sickness. It felta  bit of a responsibility to help him check for any signs of the cancer reappearing and photographanything we were unsure about.My life has felt â€˜on holdâ€™ in three main ways. One is with my volunteering positions, although as Isaid I am not in a rush to resume them, I do miss them and the satisfaction and focus they gave me.SxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B7084.pdfAnother is in leading a full social life with people coming to stay and visiting the house. Although thiscan be done under current government regulations, I choose a more cautious approach. I no longertrust government advice about Covid 19 and have formulated my own strategies to keep healthyand avoid spreading the virus. My own strategies are normally stricter than the official advice. Thethird way things are on hold is in planning holidays. We were due to go to Greece in the summer andthat was cancelled. I was due to have a holiday in Wales with a group of friends but that has beenpostponed, possibly to September, if it can be achieved safely. Who knows when it will be safe toplan    a holiday abroad.I have spent time queuing although have kept these to a minimum by ordering things online anddoing less frequent shopping expeditions. The longest queue has been at our local pharmacy whichis  a tiny shop and can only have two customers at a time inside while maintaining social distancing. Iam a patient queuer and the main irritations have been fellow customers complaining about thepharmacy staff and people walking by close to those queuing.I was very much looking forward to seeing friends again and when lockdown was eased and we metpeople again I was very excited."

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? All fine. Occasionally a sense of ‘this is all a bit weird’ and a bit ‘blue’ about being restricted, but passing light, grey, small clouds. Sometimes a bit listless Mostly fine and sometimes really enjoying it. Loving the quiet and the gorgeous spring and the freedom. Definitely a sense of how privileged we are to have a nice home, each other, open space near us, work that can be done from home, relatively secure jobs, hardly any mortgage, so much access to art and culture, lots to do, people who need us and are in touch with us. Sense of sadness about the way this is so hard for some people and that it did not have to be like this. Sense of great sadness at the way that this is exposing all the problems in society – inequality etc. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Made too late, showing incompetence, huge lack of regard for people and what really matters, unimaginative, bone-headed, party political, egotistical, inadequate… I confess that I knew Johnson was a stuffed shirt, but I thought he might at least be good at communications – but no. The contrast with Angela Merkel, Jacinda Adern and even Emmanuel Macron he is quite something. TheCabinetareabunchofpeople whowouldjustsay ‘yes’toBrexit,sotheyhavebeen as useless as I had expected. Rishi Sunak seems to have some more talent, but is very inexperienced. This was never going to be easy and I really am glad I am not in power, but the mess we are now in has been hugely created by the lazy, neglectful, incompetence of the Johnson brigade. They have got us into a huge mess and I have no idea how we’re now going to get out of it. I expect them to continue to be reactive – and too late. They expect they will lose control again and there will be more spikes in infection. I expect they will try to dump the blame away from themselves as much as possible. I expect they will have to keep propping up the economy despite themselves. I expect they will lurch between faux-stiff upper lip and panic and that the fabric of society will be further damaged, many lives lost and livelihoods ruined. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Starting with the last one – yes, these briefings should be fully accessible. Typical that they are not! I sometimes listen on R4. (You’ve just reminded me there might be one on now!) They were important to institute and replaced the shambles of the early days. Now they are trying to manipulate them so that they do not get questioned by people who have much knowledge. They are also too often full of bluster or platitudes. Clear, honest communication is vital and that’s lapsing again. BBC website, Guardian website, leading journalists and political commentators picked up via Twitter, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, sometimes journal articles such as Spectator and New Statesman, bits of local media (YorkMix etc). Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I am still working at home. Hours have been longer. It’s harder to get the work done in a reasonable time as jobs take longer, it’s harder to communicate with students and colleagues, the pastoral need is greater and takes more time, it’s hard to learn new digital skills fast to get things working online. There’s been some great creativity in terms of online CPD for teachers. I have enjoyed the challenge of creating something meaningful for teacher trainees. Overall, though, work is more admin and less of the satisfying parts. I am loving seeing so much of my husband. He’s my best friend and we get to have coffee, lunch etc together. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have been using many. I have to use them all day for work. I am attending courses from work to help me learn to use them for next year. Having done the basics, we now need to get more sophisticated in how we teach. There’s been lots more of many and I have been on things like Facebook (which I detest) in order to pick up with some people. The last thing I like doing is contacting friends and family digitally after staring at a screen all day, but needs must. We’ve had drinks with friends online. Overall, I find it a very pale shadow of the real contact. However, I’ve always hated telephoning people, so may not be typical! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? We have been able to carry on getting local deliveries from independent shops. We go to pick things up at an appointed time and do deliveries for other people, including people isolating. It seemed as though it might not have been possible for a while, but people have adapted. There is even now flour. My husband is a keen amateur chef with considerable talent and he has been putting his creative energies into cooking. We are not eating more, but it’s amazing -try fresh pasta made with wild garlic, or homemade ravioli with sorrel, or ox cheek marinated and served with caponata and polenta! We are drinking a bit less as we are still usually just having a drink at weekends and we might have had a dinner party with friends and therefore drunk more. With just the two of us we drink a bit less -nice quality wine and proper real ale, though! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had hoped to have some time to do more, but do not. I have continued playing my violin, though lessons are not so much fun over Zoom. I am still doing daily German on Duolingo, as I was before, to refresh my knowledge. I bought the Hilary Mantel novel before lockdown and am enjoying it. We are pleased that Series 3 of Babylon Berlin is out, but have got back to Series 1 and 2 before getting to it. I have tidied out a couple of cupboards that needed it. My husband is still doing his allotment. Exercise is a bit harder as my back is not so good with all the desk work, so I have done a bit of yoga, which I hate. Running and a bit of cycling, the rowing machine and some walking remain the usual exercise. We have enjoyed some of the National Theatre live and RSC repeats. As the weather has mostly been so lovely we have been outside on the front bench and seen lots more of the neighbours as we can all socially distance easily in our terraced front houses. We have got around to getting some plants for the pots in the backyard and at the front as we are here a bit more and someone local was selling plants to make some money. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? We both dress for work still jeans, but a smarter top. Not much has changed, though my husband is clipping his own hair and mine is just getting ridiculously thatch like, but who cares! I am not someone who spends long on anything like hair and beauty. Nothing really has changed, I would say. We do try to be very conscious of washing out hands on returning home if we have been out, but we hardly go out. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Ah no, I have always been an excellent, heavy sleeper and this continues. I might have had a dream connected with not having an outlet for creativity a few weeks back, so I made sure to do some more creative work."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health . Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. K goes for long cycle rides along wonderfully empty roads at weekends, I have an online yoga class once a week. We take short evening walks around the block and along the canal towpath, admiring the roses in neighbouring front gardens. . Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. K had a small facial skin procedure under local anaesthetic, carried out with full PPE. I periodically have problems with my ears, which wax up so that I am to some extent deaf: they have been gradually waxing up and are in addition rather itchy, but it seems too minor a matter to bother our GP. . How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I don’t normally keep a journal except on trips etc, and I thought of lockdown as a similar discrete period, [though as time goes on and it extends itself imperceptibly I am no longer so sure] so it seemed worth keeping a record, to note changes of mood and activities: I sometimes wonder though whether the examined life is another word for endless navel-gazing. I feel generally restless and unsettled. The events in the headlines and news broadcasts seem rather far away, like the sound of distant gunfire. I am unlikely to catch the virus and if I catch it I am unlikely to die of it. The likelihood of a disabling stroke at my age is the same as before the virus, namely more likely and more unpredictable than catching the virus and the consequences more serious: If I die of the virus then I die, but the effects on my family of a disabling stroke would be drastic. Ones thoughts are so filled with the death and infection figures that one forgets that 50,000 deaths, awful though they are, represent a minute proportion of the population. Of course there should not be any deaths at all, and there would be fewer if we had a more responsible government. The Government . What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Unprintable. Words fail me. Half of me cant bear to think about it, part of me obsessively thinks of nothing else. Many of the measures seem to be taken for short-term political gain, since the scientific opinion is divided. . What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? It will bash through some hard-Brexit measures, assuming probably correctly that the public is too exhausted and bemused by CoVid19 to notice. It seems already clear that concern for economic activity trumps concern for public health. Boris Johnson is taking advantage of the social distancing rules to emasculate parliament, by making it impossible to meet. News . Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Primarily newspapers: the FT weekend and the Guardian/Observer daily. Sometimes the Channel l4 news at 7 . Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. No, I don’t think I could bear to watch. They would make me too angry . Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a serious problem about credibility on all fronts. . There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I hadn’t heard about it, but I think it would be an excellent initiative. Another example of how the Scots are more sensitive and resilient than we are in these matters. Work and home life . Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Both K and I are retired, with adequate pensions, so there are no financial problems. He is a retired academic and continues to work on his research with all the time in the world, now that conferences etc are being cancelled. He misses being able to go into libraries, but is amazed by what is available through remote data bases. . How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Life inside the house is pretty unaffected, but we miss eating out, concerts and seeing friends and family, especially grandchildren. We are fortunate that we find each other congenial and stimulating company. However, if we did not have each other, we might well be rather lonely. . We find that what we miss most are impromptu, unpredictable and random moments. Going into the city for meetings etc used to involve browsing in bookshops, window-shopping, coffee or lunch, unexpected meeting with acquaintances etc. Shopping on line is no substitute: ordering a specific book through abe books is not the same as browsing the local Oxfam bookshop. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? . Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re­connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I sit on the broads of several charities which have needed emergency meetings, so I have learned fast to use Zoom and conference calls. I was amazed and angered to see how much these conference calls can cost participants, and one of my charities has been slow to recognize these charges as expenses like travel costs. Not having to factor in travelling time and costs for attending meetings is a huge advantage, but there is a loss of informal personal contact before and after discussion which is a pity. . It is also quite disconcerting to see oneself on a Zoom screen: every wrinkle and hair out of place is magnified : “ can this old crone be ME?”. Other people’s backgrounds can be very distracting. I want to tell one of my yoga classmates who does her exercises in her bedroom “Please could you shut your wardrobe door?” . Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I didn’t use social media before and haven’t considered doing so now. Shopping and food . What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? We haven’t been doing any bulk/panic buying. I am making a point of using small shops rather than supermarkets as I think they need support more. However, there was a time when the only place to buy a new supply of tights was M&S, because clothes shops were considered non-essential. K, who makes our bread, had problems getting yeast at a time when half the nation started baking, but that phase passed . Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Unconnected with lockdown, I have been making an effort to cook/eat more fish and vegetables and less meat, so I have gone on doing that. I upgraded the size of my weekly veg box. I try every week to cook something out of the weekend cookery supplements by way of variety. We have also been ordering a weekly takeaway from the gastropub at the end of our road, to help keep it in business. I spend more time thinking about food, partly because I have to think about lunch as well, but also because cooking is a pleasant creative activity. We eat in a very relaxed style, eating and reading and talking all at the same time, so our table manners are deteriorating. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? . No new hobbies, skills or games. A lot of gardening: clearing overgrown climbers for the first time in 10 years, repotting house and courtyard plants and making another attempt at a herb garden. The garden is a great pleasure this spring: when did we last have two months of almost uninterrupted fine weather? So many plants have flowered their full length, instead of being rained out half way though their blossoming time, especially paeonies. Roses have had a very good year. There has been time to notice how long the period of developing buds lasts compared with the short period of full flowering. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. . I have a zoom session once a week with an elderly friend who has recovered enough from a recent stroke to have conquered Zoom and to be comfortable with it. We have read Penelope Lively’s book on gardening and her memoir of childhood. Also Lucy Mangan’s Bookworm. We started Kim, but she found the plot too complicated, so we have now taken up Just So Stories. . K read his way through Luther’s translation of the New Testament and made notes on it. He is an atheist with professional interest in the German Enlightenment. I am a cradle Anglican, now a recovering Christian and a Quaker attender. I am reading my way through the King James NT and we are reading a chapter of the NRSV aloud each evening. It is instructive to see how the whole work hangs together and how many parts are never read aloud in the lectionary, [and sometimes it is clear why not] so one actually knows it much less well than one thinks. Also I have been reading alongside it Dairmaid McCullogh’s Christianity, which has been very illuminating . . My pre-publication copy of Hilary Mantel’s The mirror and the light arrived just before lockdown, and I started again from the beginning of Wolf Hall, rivetted all the way through, even though the third volume is more discursive and prolix. Alongside them I read McCullogh’s biography of Thomas Cromwell – fascinating comparisons. After that, I re-read Prescott’s The man on a donkey: very impressive and moving in a completely different way from Mantel and McCullogh, less interested in the political manoeuvres and more in the spiritual and mystical life of her characters. Finally I re-read Ford Madox Ford’s The fifth queen and found I had almost totally forgotten it: under all the tushery and Godwottery it is vivid and convincing. All the novels use the same state papers as McCullogh, so many of the scenes are repeated verbatim but show very different emphases. And although one knows that Katharine Howard was completely different from the way Ford portrays her, and although one knows that Prescott’s characters cannot possibly have known about Julian of Norwich , one is still moved by the quotations. . When I needed a bit of comfort reading I went back and did all the Antonia Forest series about the Marlows and the wartime novels by Angela Thirkell – oddly similar to today in that people are coping with changes in regulations sometimes at short notice, and have the feeling that the real action is going on elsewhere. . We watched the RSC Othello on livestream. I saw Hugh Quarshie play Othello 45 years ago when he was an undergraduate, so it roused many memories. A very interesting production. The Iago was also black, but nothing was made of this in the production’s treatment: the RSC has had a commendable policy of colour-blind casting for many years and this makes a discreet way of flagging up other ways of looking at the racism. . We have watched again several series from the 1980s: Behaving Badly, The jewel in the crown and Fortunes of war Personal hygiene . We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My hair has not been cut since the end of January, as my immune-compromised visiting hairdresser stopped taking customers even before lockdown, and she wont begin again until early July, so I look about as untrimmed as my hedge. We try not to slob about, but there is a strong temptation each morning after showering just to put on the clothes one took off the night before. Sleep . There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Sometimes, I have narrative dreams like watching a film, these days the dreams are more obviously like working through visual and verbal material taken in from outside, like data. I rarely remember anything on waking."

THANK YOU. Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: COVID-19 Update In Dublin, my great-uncle, who is suffering from leukaemia, was rushed to hospital for stomach pains. He contracted coronavirus while on a ward with two men who had the disease. he has now been hospitalised for two weeks, but, strangely, has no symptoms. He has been tested for the virus – and has definitely got it. But apparently he has a very rare blood type, which – supposedly – protects him from falling severely ill. Currently, he is receiving chemotherapy for a tumour in his bowels; if he were to suddenly develop dangerous coronavirus symptoms, I don’t think he will survive. From mygrandad, I hear mygreat-uncle is maintaining astrong and optimistic mentality, “must’n’grumble” is his catchphrase! My mum’s friend, who is in her forties, lost her mother and abrother eight months ago. Two weeks ago, her other brother died from a heart attack. She travelled over to Dublin to be with her family and has not yet returned. Being separated from family members is the hardest struggle under lockdown, especially if relatives are suffering. At home, living has become claustrophobic, with everyday being Groundhog Day. I rise and sleep at the same time, eat at the same time, and do the same menial tasks over and over, occasionally go out for a walk or a run. Tensions are beginning to run high at home, withpettysquabbles breaking out over cleaning/cooking/shopping. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so long in one place with my family. I think the government has been slow to establish the lockdown and to increase testing for keyworkers and those with symptoms, especiallyin Wales. And the government’s message to ‘stayat home’ and ‘stayalert’ has been completely undermined bythe activities of Dominic Cummings. It’s one rule for them, and another for the rest. In the coming months, I think the government will attempt to pick themselves up fromCummings’ blunder – and mostly continue as ifthere wasn’t a complete disregard for the rules!They’ll expect the public to continue to follow their orders, but I think tensions are beginning to run high (I heard in the news of a party broken up in London over the weekend; and tensions are certainlyrunning high in America). I don’t think Cummings will resign – or be sacked. I think we’llbegin to see in England non-essential shops to reopen soon. Idon’t want this to happen in Wales; I think it’s far too soon and fear a second peak occurring. Expecting the whole public to adhere to the two-meter distance rule while outside just won’t work. The lockdown should continue until at least mid-July. I’m beginning to feela bit frustrated bythe news. Iused to regularly watch the government’s 5pmbriefings and interviews on BBC Breakfast but I’mbeginning to feeldisheartened by whatever they’re saying. I don’t have confidence in Downing Street. The dailyrising death tolldoesn’t inspire pride in the government’s actions;I’m horrified to discover the UK’s peak deaths was one of the highest in Europe –and considering we’re a tiny landmass compared to Italy and Spain. I felt reassured by the government when the UK first went into lockdown, now I’m fed up with their messages. England’s urge to ‘stayalert’ is an arbitraryconcept; it provides no real sense of action to the public. Is the public meant to be looking over their shoulders to check if coronavirus isn’t spying on them fromanearbybuilding?Behind America, I’m relieved I don’t live in England. Wales continuing with lockdown makes me feel slightly reassured. Over summer I would typically work for M&S but I have not heard from them. The closing of non-essential shops means I won’t be hired in womenswear and its unlikelyI’llbe recruited in the Food Hall considering the company will have a surplus of workers without work to call-up. The drive from Prestatyn is not something I’m yearning to repeat, but Ido miss my independence. Being constantly stuck at home, after living by myself for three years at university has been difficult. Knowing that I’d have asmallincome over summer would be something to look forward to over the holidays. But spending quality time with my family at home is rewarding. My parents are working from home; my mum more so than my dad. She’s a solicitor and takes calls/answers emails and does dictation in the dining room, while mydad is in the living roompretending to do work. He’s a headteacher and will take the odd phone call or send an email while watching TV. As my mum is in the vulnerable category, mydad’s been picking up and dropping off files at her office on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays when she’s working. She has got frustrated with his slow pace quite often;he’s reluctant to get out of bed and drive to H. It usually ends with my mum chasing him out of the door at 10am when he still hasn’t left. Keeping in contact with my grandparents has been entertaining. My cousin invited my Nana to do a quiz over Zoom and flat-out refused because she couldn’t be bothered. But to be fair, she and my grandad have learnt how to use facetime on her iPad. They regularly facetime my family but it’s very rare we get a glimpse of their faces – it’s usually the ceiling, their hairlines, or their thumbs. My mum was invited by the priest to join our parish on a Zoom mass. So far, I’ve sat throughfour masses on our living roomcouch everySundayat 11am. It’s difficult to stop myself from yawning. There are no hymns. No readers. And no congregation. All listeners are put on mute and all you can see is the priest, alone, in church performing the mass. To compensate for the Eucharist, the priest puts an image and a piece of music on the screen for listeners to reflect upon. It isn’t the same. But my cats are very entertaining; they’re disconcerted byout silence when the walk into the living room and attempt to gain attention bydropping leaves they’ve caught at our feet. It’s very sweet. Mydad arranged aZoomcallwith an old schoolfriend fromAmerica he’d recentlygot in touch with. He was shocked to discover his friend had left his wife and family and remarried to a man. Without the lockdown, Idon’t think he’d had got in touchwith his old friend. He’s been on Facebook regularly trying to reconnect with old acquaintances. As my mum is in the vulnerable category, the weekly shop has fallen upon me to fulfil. My dad hates shopping; asking him to do a big shop twice a week will probably tip him over the edge. Heviews domestic work as ‘woman’s work’and so does absolutely nothing around the house. I go around three times a week and buy only what we need; I make a meal plan and try to arrange a night of eating leftovers twice a week to stop bulk buying. Previously, man family never did this; my mum would nip into Aldi on the way home from work and buy something; onlyoccasionally would we have leftovers. Ionly shop at Lidl;I feel Aldi’s quality of fruit and veg has become poor, and Tesco is too expensive. But I think Lidl is poor at maintaining socialdistancing between customers and staff. Yes, there’s a cleaning station to disinfect trolleys and baskets at the store’s entrance, and the tills are equipped withplastic screens and two-meter standing points, but that’s it. The rest ofthe store is afree-for-all, open to an individual’s interpretation of ‘two-meters’. And not all customers use the cleaning station; even the pump on the hand sanitiser is so stiff, I can only manage to squeeze a drop from it before the stand threatens to topple over! One fifty-something man lent directly over me to grab a bag of carrots and mumbled ‘sorry, love’ when I glared at him. Itryand go early in the mornings (around 9am) to avoid people like these liberally shopping, without adhering to the two-meter rule. It’s been a struggle to entertain myself, especially now that I have finished university, with no exams to revise for. In April I had my last video-call seminar and have found myself bored. I’ve so far done two-and-a-half jigsaw puzzles, before getting bored and giving up; all three were Christmas themed, being the only we had in the house. I’ve practiced a lot onthe piano, but don’t think I’ve improved at all. Itend to play the same songs over and over untilI move on to something else. But I have done a lot of reading and have slowly started to plough through all the books ive piled up from birthdays and Christmas. Since the beginning of lockdown in MarchI’ve read fourteen books. And I’ve begun to read feminist literature;I’ve been wanting to read Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez for awhile. I’ve refused to pay for it in hardback, but there was only one copy in the library in Lancaster, so I bought it for mybirthdayin paperback and read it in two days. I’m now on Difficult Women by Helen Lewis. I’ve also read My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell which was so disturbing, on top of watching the Filthy Rich documentary on Netflix on the Epstein scandal. But it gets so depressing in the evenings if the only stories to listen to are either coronavirus or sexual abuse. Myself, my mum and my sister have started doing quizzes of an evening out of sheer boredom; we’re all terrible!I’m convinced mysister is cheating at the true/false questions. Personal hygiene has gone right out of the window. Yes, I still thoroughly wash my hands and take regular showers, but I’ve given up on routinely washing my hair or ironing my clothes, or actually getting dressed into something other than pyjamas. Given we can only go out to exercise or shop for foodonce aday, what’s the point?I’ve even succumbed to a lockdown haircut for the sheer problemthat I didn’t know what else to do with myhair. It’s now resting just under my collarbone, with a good four inches hacked off. I allowed my mum to do it, and I think she quite enjoyed herself. I only get my haircut once a year since I refuse to regularly pay £30 for a trim. And after the lockdown, Idon’t think I ever will!I actually quite like mynew haircut;I didn’t have to suffer through endless chatter at the salon, or dither over how I wanted it cut, or come out of the salon after two hours despising it anyway! It was great! And my cat was very confused over what was happening. He sat under my chair throughout watching bits ofhair fall to throughground. My mumeven cut mydad’s hair, but I don’t think he’ll let her at it again. It looked dreadful. Verypatchy…I even think he was slightly bald in one spot, just in front of his ears! Thankfully, it’s beginning to grow back. But even mymum is beginning to look like NoelFielden; her fringe is so long she can’t see and has had to make an emergency set of headbands to pull it off her face. I’ve been sleeping very soundlythroughout the lockdown. The onlyproblem is trying to spend the day in order to make myself tired in the evenings to want to go to bed. My sister has done the opposite: she woke at 1pm a few days ago and during the evening decided the only way to get her sleeping schedule back on track was to pull an all-nighter. I remember waking at 6:30am to find her sitting up in bed, completely dressed, watching a film on her laptop. From her clear-eyed look (different to her accustomed zombie gaze) I could tell immediately she hadn’t gone to sleep – at all! My mum was fuming. She went to bed at 9pm that day after being up 32 hours. To be honest, her attempt to renew her sleeping schedule did work – for about a week. She consistently rose around 7am, but recently she’s been getting up at 11:30am. I think the lack of structure in her day from school has relaxed her attempts to take care of herself."

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health I’ve been anxious because of the pandemic. I feel very Asian in public. Acts of racial violence towards Asian people globally really worry me and make me realize that there are so many shitty, racist people in the world. I started therapy online during the lockdown, which has helped a little, I think. My partner rarely experiences anxiety, even during this pandemic, which makes me feel distant and like I can’t relate. Physically, we’ve been fine and our families have been fine. My mother in law and dad both had colds during lockdown, and now I wonder whether they actually had COVID. But they haven’t been tested. When they got sick, California had really limited testing. In the past few weeks, we’ve been hearing about lockdown modifications. We’ve been seeing countries end lockdowns and ease lockdowns. This, surprisingly, makes me feel anxious. I’m anxious about the return to the high speed and expectations of normality. I’m still working a shitty online job that will take anyone and thus feel basically unemployed, so job searching during normality will mean I’ll be beating myself up a lot for being unemployed again, which is a mindset that’s died down a little during the lockdown. The lockdown felt like an excuse to be unemployed. When everyone returns to work, i’ll feel like I’m back to being the different, non-participatory unemployed person. The Government I think Boris Johnson is a fool for easing lockdown measures already. I think Nicola Sturgeon is making the right choice in not easing measures, is a straight shooter who actually answers questions instead of evading them. I predict that in the upcoming months, we’ll see more unwise decision-making from Boris Johnson. News I try to limit my news consumption to Mondays only. I read the New York Times and the BBC. I noticed the BSL interpreters at Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings and thought it was awesome/she is awesome. Work and home life I’ve been teaching English second language classes for about 10 hours a week online to kids in Beijing. It feels like I’m unemployed though because this company will take anyone and I’m so sick of teaching. I just got my masters in a non-teaching area last year, so am looking for a job in that field unsuccessfully. I feel lucky to have the online teaching thing even though it’s a lame job. I’m glad I’m childfree and don’t have to take care of kids at home during lockdown. Lockdown hasn’t changed my marriage much because we’ve been living a lockdown lifestyle during the winter after moving to Cornwall anyway due to the cold, lack of friends, and my lack of a driver’s license. Technology I haven’t learned to use any new forms of tech during lockdown. I’ve been using FaceTime and Whats App to video chat with friends and family. I use Zoom for our Cornish lessons online and Google Hangouts for online therapy. People have been swarming to TikTok but I dont want to join another social media site that will only take up more of my time. I want to use the internet less, not more. It’s been both nice and overwhelming as an introvert to suddenly get lots of video chat invitations. It’s a great thing that people have more time to reconnect in general right now though. Sometimes there’s not much to talk about because we’re all just staying home. I’ve cut down on my social media usage (I’m just on Instagram) because it’s been feeling like a waste of time and I’d rather spend that time outside or reading. I also dislike people talking about and reminding me about the pandemic on instagram lately. I understand that people want to discuss their feelings about it, which is great, but it isn’t great for my mental health so I limit instagram a lot lately. Shopping and food I miss getting groceries delivered. I’ve been the sole grocery shopper in our house because females have a lower mortality rate than males from COVID. I wear a mask. I wonder whether people feel uncomfortable around me because I’m asian. I hate that I feel this way and it makes me want to move back to California. I am appalled that people don’t obey the 2 meter rule in Tesco. We go to Waitrose sometimes because the crowds are less dense than those at Tesco, but Waitrose is more expensive. I realized that a lot of my grocery shopping anxiety comes from the huge amount of time it takes fo rme to use the self checkout machines and pack up the groceries, so I decided last week that for my mental health, I’ll start using the cashier check out instead. I’ve been trying more new recipes since lockdown because I’m craving novelty and variety. Before lockdown, I was more focused on job searching and more hopeful that I’d get hired. But now that no one is hiring, I’m spending less time on job searching and that gives me more time to cook and have fun cooking. Seeing everyone else baking sourdough makes me not want to bake sourdough though. We found a 16kg bag of flour on amazon last week and we’ve been baking and eating more sweets since. Baking is such a physical experience. It feels like the opposite of the internet. Entertainment and Leisure I’ve been staying entertained during lockdown and don’t relate to people who say they’re so bored. Maybe this is because I’m so introverted. I’ve been watercolor painting, making films, watching films, reading, watching book tubers on YouTube, identifying plants and posting them on iNaturalist, picking flowers and making bouquets, going on walks, doing at home workouts. Once a week I host a family game night on zoom. I love all the free time. It makes me wish we didn’t have to work in life so I would always have time to pursue hobbies like this. I’ve read 86 books in 2020 and love how much time I have to read! Personal hygiene I’ve been so much better about moisturizing, taking care of my skin, and taking my supplements because I have more time during lockdown. There’s just more time for self care. I bought nail polish online today because for the first time in eight years, I’m not rock climbing, so I can paint my nails without them getting chipped. I’ve gone through waves of wearing makeup because it makes me feel awake, and not wearing makeup because it’s annoying to take off and i don’t see anyone in my days anyway. Sleep My sleep has been really good during lockdown. I’ll miss sleeping 9 hours a night!"

Mass-Observer S7195 describes themself as female; age 20; single; student.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","S7195, Female, 20, Single, Bawtry, Student Spring Directive COVID Update 1. Health: I have been lucky enough to not know of anyone (personally) to have contracted/died from COVID. I know friends of friends or family of friends who have less pleasant stories though, so am aware of how lucky this makes me. In terms of my own health, both physically and mentally, I am well. However, I have been lucky enough to find a job at my local supermarket and so am able to keep myself busy. I think I would be struggling mentally, had I not had the focus and routine of employment outside of the house. 2. The Government: I have not been largely impressed with the government’s handling of the crisis. Firstly, I think Boris has been too slow to implement public safety measures – this was the case with implementing the lockdown, facilitating testing, a track and trace system and the compulsory wearing of facemasks. I appreciate the unique nature of the situation, but think that Boris has been incompetent. However, it pains me to say, I have been somewhat impressed by Sunak’s attempts to support the economy; although flawed, his policies have been uncharacteristically generous for a Tory chancellor and hope they will have propped up areas of the economy which would have otherwise disappeared. 3. News: I keep up with the news by watching BBC News at night, but also through twitter – my algorithms largely reflect current affairs and I enjoy following debates on there. My family and I are lucky enough to freely and easily access news sources, but I appreciate this may not be the case for others. I would support any attempt to make the news more accessible. 4. Work and Home Life: Throughout the pandemic and lockdown I have; written my dissertation, turned 21, graduated from university and started a new job. I have been working in the Home Delivery department at a local, and feel very lucky to have the job. It has kept me busy, and in a routine but also allows me to contribute to the community. I think has also had a positive effect on the relationships I have with my family; there is generally less tension, as I am not here as often and so we can enjoy space from each other during this intense time. My mum (a history teacher and head of dept) has been working from home, and I think has found the experience more testing, due to the lack of variety. My dad (a prison governor) has been attending work throughout. I think this has allowed our family to enjoy a smoother quarantine, as we are not constantly together. 5. Technology: I have kept in touch with friends through zoom, facetime and social media. In recent weeks I have been more able to meet up with them, and have enjoyed socially distanced picnics or drinks etc. I think there has been a pressure to keep up with friends; there is a growing cancel culture, that assumes that when people do not check in with you, they aren’t nice people. I am keen to avoid this, but also take a genuine interest in my friend’s wellbeing. 6. Shopping and Food: As previously mentioned, I work in Home Delivery and I suppose I have a unique insight into having groceries delivered. We offer home delivery and click/collect and are very busy at the moment. We have gotten increasingly so as time has gone on too – the company don’t expect to see a decline any time soon either. I know some people can be unhappy with availability, but this is because customers are purchasing so much, shelf stackers/suppliers struggle to keep up. I know tensions are high, but I sometimes wonder if customers know that there lack of a full shop is not for the want of trying! I have also heard many people S7195, Female, 20, Single, Bawtry, Student Spring Directive feedback to us saying that they struggle to get delivery slots, so I wonder if that is a worry for some too. At M we also offer a doorstep delivery for vulnerable people, who phone their order in – this is used a lot by elderly people around the area. a. I have been doing our family’s weekly shop, and have found that stock is mostly there – we can largely get everything we want and the experience is generally pretty normal. However, I do go on quiet, mid-week days at an early time, so may miss the rush. b. In terms of eating habits, I think you would expect us to be eating healthier, homecooked meals. However, in reality, we eat relatively similar to usual – we have always eaten relatively well and so have largely been maintaining this. 7. Entertainment and Leisure: If I am honest, I am not too sure how I have been entertaining myself! I spend a lot of my day at work, then take a nap (as I get up at 3am) and by then it is almost teatime, and then I will get ready for bed. I have been enjoying some TV and have been grateful for the return of football – I enjoy watching that too. Aside from this, I have spent a bit of time learning how to draw/trace pictures to create digital images – I have used them to draw my friends with a cap and gown on for their graduations. 8. Personal Hygiene: I have found myself washing my hands much more than usual, and so I sometimes get dry hands – I have never used so much hand cream in my life! I also wash my hair everyday now, which I didn’t before. However, this is more to do with wanting to present myself well at work, over hygiene. 9. Sleep: I have been sleeping pretty regularly, aside from moving my routine to sleep earlier and get up earlier for work. However, before I had the job, I found I didn’t find it as easy – I wonder if this was because I was not doing much to use my energy and was without a routine."

In good health before the lockdown, we’ve since had no Covid-19 symptoms and no other ailments. Mental health is an interesting question. If this had happened five or six years ago, when my mum was still alive and in a care home with advanced dementia, I would have been absolutely beside myself with anxiety and stress. I’mglad, frankly, that myparents are no longer alive. I wouldn’t have wanted themto go through this in their eighties, when both of them were very ill. Before the lockdown started, I was anxious about my cousin and my uncle; once it was clear that they were both in safe places, being looked after, I was able to relax much more. I feel as thoughI’ve been given a hugegift of time – to read, write, think, make things, enjoy being with my immediate family. With this gift comes guilt. The current lockdown has some weird similarities with my lifestyle during the three years I spent as a VSO volunteer in East Africa, 1990 – 93. It was a time when, at first, everything was radically different – but I gradually got used to it. Domestic routines, cooking, laundry, cleaning, took up more time, as they do now. My mind felt more peaceful and clear, less clogged up with minutiae and minor stresses. Then, as now, I had more time to read, write and enjoy nature. Then, as now, I felt guilty about how lucky I was compared to others – the extreme poverty; those who are ill or anxious about their livelihoods. Then, as now, I became a bit of a hermit, jealously guarding my privacy. Then, there was a real danger of disease – malaria, HIV – which meant I had to be constantly careful. The same is true now. But probably the biggest differences between then and now are the social distancing and the working from home. The emotions I have experienced over the last couple of months: disbelief, dread, wonder, gratitude, calm, curiosity, pity – and intense anger towards our government. My children are lucky: they are old enough, able and motivated to study by themselves. My older daughter in particular is loving having all this time to read and write and think. My younger daughter I think finds it harder – I suspect she wonders how and when all this will end; what will the future be like. My husband and I try to keep the conversation open, talking about possibilities, giving reassurance. She is very musical, so has a lot of opportunity at the moment to practise her instruments, and I’m glad she can. It must be very tough for sporty kids. The Government Clearly they have made some terrible mistakes, which is why we have the highest death rate in the world, after the US.Already they’re trying to‘spin’ this. Ifeelthe ethos of the Conservative government is to prioritise economic growth; wealth creation; independence. When those elements appeared to be under threat, they dug in their heels and delayed the lockdown. That has proved to be a truly tragic decision. Asa Remainer, I’mdeeply angrythat wehave spent the last four years expending so much time, money and bad will on the Brexit process. Now, whatever happens with Brexit, we won’t be able to evaluate its impact because the virus has skewed everything. We will never know whether we would have been better off economically without Brexit. So I’mdetermined that one daythis government willbe held to account over its response to the virus and I have already resolved that during the next general election campaign, whenever that maybe, I willgo out canvassing, probablyfor Labour. I’ve never done this before. But in recent years, teaching adult education classes, I have realised just how misinformed many adults are; how confused they are, especially, about what they see on social media. The devolved government in Wales has mostly gone along with the London govt, although it imposed stricter rules on exercising; we were only allowed out for an hour initially. On May 8th Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, made what I thought was a good statement, basically saying the lockdown should continue for the time being, and schools would not be reopening. Boris Johnson had been making vague noises about schools. I’mreallyglad Wales went ahead and stood firm. At the time of writing this on 13th May, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all asserted their own rules with regard to the lockdown. (Somebody on Twitter made the witty comment that ‘Wales, Scotland and N. Ireland have left the chat-room.’) In England the message is now ‘Stayalert’. Onsocial media manypeople are saying this is unclear; many others are saying it’s perfectlyobvious what it means – observe social distancing, wash your hands etc – but the key question is whether by relaxing the lockdown and encouraging people to go back to work if they can’t work from home, the govt. is increasing the risk of the virus spreading and more people dying. I suspect this will be the case. People, including a friend of mine, are saying ‘It’s all very complex; you have to weigh up the risks of dying from Covid-19 against the risks of people dying because their mental health is suffering or they lose their jobs and have to eat junk food’ etc. To me, it seems obvious that Covid-19 can kill you even if you’re healthy, whereas losing your jobdoesn’t necessarily mean that your health will get worse. Future Government steps: I’mwriting this five days after the VEdaycelebrations on Friday8th. It seems that many, many people did not observe social distancing. On social media, medics are I think shops will re-open, but there will be social distancing and sanitizing measures. Perhaps opening hours will be extended. There will be job losses in many sectors. UK travel will be allowed within a certain radius. People will be discouraged from using public transport. I don’t know howthis will workin London. Ithink schools won’t re-open until September, and then, possibly, school attendance might be staggered, e.g. some year groups only attending on certain days. I wonder if perhaps leisure centres will be converted into temporary education centres – so that all children can be in some form of school (thus enabling parents to return to work) but with more chance of preserving social distancing. News Radio 4;BBC News at 10and Twitter, although it’s hard to avoid the intense toxicity on Twitter, and I wonder what’s true or not. Like manypeople, I realised earlyon that I’d have to limit my media consumption in order not to be overwhelmed. So now Itry to confine it to the R4 news headlines, PM on R4 between 5 and 6 (govt. briefing) and the 10 o’clock BBC news after everyone has gone to bed. Sometimes I watch Newsnight. The most upsetting thing is to compare our news now, with how they were reporting on Italy and Spain a month ago when the coverage consisted of the subdued intoning of death rates, mournful silences over shots of makeshift morgues, bodies being loaded into refrigerator lorries. Now, there is a kind of grim briskness in the reporting of the rising death-rate, and a hideous desire to distract the public with anykind of‘good news’. I’mglad, of course, that Boris Johnson did not die. But he has in the past said that politicians need a ‘dead cat’ – an item of startling information to distract the public from unpalatable stuff. His being in intensive care wasthe ultimate ‘dead cat’. So was his release from hospital. So was the birth of his son. All of these dead cats have distracted the public from the horror of the rising death toll. Ifhe had died, I don’t think there would have been any street parties on VE day. The Daily Press Conference It needs to happen; journalists must hold these people – politicians, scientists, medical chiefs – to account. The absence ofPritiPatel, the Home Secretary, is hugely noticeable. Ithink she’s done a couple of‘pressers’ at most. Ithink theyknow she’s unpopular with the public as she has form, e.g. for bullying civil servants, and she makes mistakes, e.g. over numbers of tests. A friend has a theory that Patel is busy designing a punishing system of benefit cuts for when all this is over. BSL is already being used during press conferences given by the Welsh Government. Of course it should also be used in London. Work and home life Iteach adults throughthe council’s community learning department. Ilove my job – small classes ofpeople who often lack confidence, so it’s a pleasure to see their confidence develop. Most courses are eleven weeks long and lead to a basic qualification. In March, seeing what was coming, I managed to get most of my ‘learners’ to complete their courses. It was very noticeable that during earlyMarchI didn’t receive anyinformation from my managers about plans for changing working arrangements. This could partly be due to the fact that all my classes take place in various community locations, so I rarely see my managers in person. However, there was nothing by email. I’mpretty sure this was because they were being given so little information and guidance themselves, they were unable to pass anything on to tutors. I also teach three creative writing classes – one for people with mental health issues; one for mentalhealth, learning and physicaldisabilities; one for ‘lifelong learners’. I took the decision to continue teaching these classes via email. I enjoy it, and I think the learners do too. At the moment, the Council are still paying me as if for the same hours I was teaching before the lockdown. I’mon an hourlyrate, without sickness benefits. The payis not high, but it’s worth it to do a jobI enjoyand that feels worthwhile. I’m extremely grateful to have been paid for the last few months even though doing less work. I suspect this situation won’t last. Sporadically, managers get in touchto say‘We have to look at new ways ofdelivering’ and ‘tell me your ideas’. So I reply to them, and then hear nothing back. I think eventually they may get us to teach via Google Classrooms, which they are currentlyencouraging usto ‘explore’. I’ve startedto do so; Google Classrooms seems OK. For the time being I shall carry on teaching via email. I’mglad my immediate familyare at home, safe. From time to time I yearn to have the house to myself. I tend to get up before everyone else and go to bed after everyone else, just for the sense of peacefulness – althoughI’m lucky; my family aren’t noisy or argumentative. My daughters are doing school work. The one who should be doing GCSEs right now has started preparing for A levels. She wants to do English, French, Welsh and Historyso it’s easyfor her to do lots of reading, learning vocabularyetc. She’s also reading the Hilary Mantel Cromwell trilogy, which she loves (as do I) – and the books are so long, she probably wouldn’t have had time to read them in normal circumstances. My younger daughter is just coming to the end of Year 9. The school has posted cheery podcasts and sensible instructions: aim to do 3 x 45 minute chunks of schoolwork per day, focusing on literacy, numeracy and another subject of your choice. Both girls are continuing with their music lessons: piano by Zoom, violin by Google Duo and double bass by WhatsApp. Who knew this could work so well?! Their lovely ballet teacher, who has been teaching them since they were three, has created Vimeo videos with a password which they can access, and to an extent practise ballet at home. This is very calming. If the current crisis had to happen, it’s happened at the least awful time for our daughters. Older daughter had worked hard so will get decent teacher-assessed GCSE grades. In her heart of hearts, she thinks exams are a load of cobblers anyway, so she doesn’t mind that they’ve been cancelled;doesn’t feelthat her work has been ‘wasted’. Allthe kids in her year group are in the same boat, and also exams can of course go disastrously wrong on the day, no matterhow hard you’ve worked. (Perhaps one good thing to come out of this will be an acknowledgement that there are more important things in life than exams, and better ways of learning?) Younger daughter hasn’t yet started her GCSE courses, so doesn’t have to worry about ‘missing out’. But I know she misses her friends, and playing in orchestras. Technology Myhusband and I have Nokia ‘brick’phones which westill use for texts and calls. With the advent of the crisis, I finally caved in re smart phones and we are now sharing our daughter’s old Android phone, so wecan WhatsApp family members. We’ve probablybeen in touch with them more in the last few months than we have for ages. We’re also using Zooma lot, for talking to family and friends, for my husband’s guitar society meetings, for me to attend poetry readings, and my husband sometimes uses it for work. My sister-in-law asked the serious philosophicalquestion: ‘Who does the virus serve?’ and my immediate, instinctive response was: ‘It serves Zoom.’ But hopefully also ‘the planet’. The only social media platform I use is Twitter –mostly to read, not to post. Even before the crisis I was thinking I might quit, on the grounds that it’s distracting, time-wasting, relentlessly jolly or relentlessly nasty. But I keep sneaking back. Without Twitter I wouldn’t have been alerted to the online poetryreadings (see above) whichI have absolutely loved. There is something very intimate and moving about people reading their poems to you from their own homes. Shopping I appointed myself household shopper, as I feel J is more susceptible to picking up illnesses (he’s underweight). He was worried about me shopping and said I should MO P7209 only go to small local shops. I quickly realised how unworkable this was, when trying to carry several bags home from the local mini-Tesco. So:on average I do abig shop at the big Sainsbury’s about once aweek, and every Saturday morning I go to the mini-Tesco to buy the Guardian and top up the basics like milk and bread. I feel like a criminal every time I go out. I’ve occasionallyhad to queue outside shops, but not for long. I’ve discovered that ifI can get there by 8 a.m. there are far fewer people. I thank the staff, saying things like ‘Ifit wasn’t for you, we’d allbe dead’ – and most staff are being really lovely and helpful. But it’s hard to maintain the two metres distance. People weave around. If someone’s hovering between broccolior green beans, do Iwait for themto choose, or sidle past? Usually the latter. I tryto keep myface turned away. Some people don’t bother. Last Tuesday, for the first time, I wore a face mask, and felt less of a criminal – doing my bit to stop my nasty droplets spreading. One challenge has been the lack of Quorn pieces for our vegetarian meals. Last week, after nearlytwo months without, I found some in Sainsbury’s. I felt like acaveman carrying home a mammoth. There’s also an absence offlour. Are people really baking their own bread? On arriving home from the shops, I make sure the rest of the family are out of the way (whereas usuallyI’d be insisting theyhelp) – I get the bags inside, I wash the shopping with soapy water or disinfectant wipes, and I put the bags in the washing machine. This is on Public Health advice, but it’s very time-consuming and tedious. We are definitely cooking more meals (lunches as well as evening – if it was just me on my own I’d just have a piece of toast), and it’s lovelyhaving more time to cook.I realise how much I care about my family eating healthily and enjoying their food. We’re eating reallywell – extending our repertoire of vegetarian meals. Our eldest daughter persuaded us all to go vegetarian at the beginning of this year, although J, S and I allow ourselves meat-once-a-month. Our daughters are cooking the evening meal once a week on a Friday night. This is something that previously their verybusy schedules wouldn’t have allowed. I kept feeling theyought to learn to cook, so now’s their chance! Entertainment and Leisure I am never, ever bored. I have done lots more reading, and having finished Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light (a whopping 875 pages), luckilypurchased before the lockdown, I have now started re-reading books which I love. Just finished Carol Shields’ Unless. Next week I’mgoing to avirtualbookgroup, for whichI have to read Conrad’s The Secret Agent, whichI studied for ALevel. I’mdoing a cross-stitch picture of a Celtic cross which I started years ago. Ambition is to finish it during lockdown. I am doing more exercise – going for hour-long walks round the park and lake; also older daughter J gets me to do an online 20 minute workout with her most evenings. We’ve started watching Modern Familyon telly, also The Great BritishSewing Bee (wholesome family viewing) Grayson Perry’s Art Club and some ofthe National Theatre’s repeats oftheir live streamings: One Man, Two Guvnors (enjoyed);Twelfth Night (enjoyed v much, saw it first time round) and last night J and I watched half of Antony and Cleopatra, but to be honest it was a bit shouty so we gave up at the interval. Older daughter’s French teacher suggested she watchFrench tellyprogrammes, so we have been enjoying a series about acclaimed contemporary chefs, all with a veritable galaxy of Michelin stars between them. My goodness they take their food seriously! We ought also to be watching Welsh language telly; I think she may be watching some up in her bedroom. Personal Hygiene Definitely washing hands more frequently, including on the days when nobody’s been out of the house. I’moccasionallywashing hair everythree days instead ofeveryother day. But I feelit is a bit minging, so am trying to keep up good habits. Sleep I have been lucky and have slept well. The family have mostly been OK although younger daughter sometimes finds it harder. It doesn’t help that in one of the student houses next door, they are a bit nocturnal and sometimes play loud music at night. I’ve told her that if theydo it again, I shallHave Words with them. Yes, lots of weird dreams; lots of social distancing anxiety and guilt. Last week I dreamt we were all sliding down a huge blue slippery slope, what could that possibly mean? Surely nothing to do with the Tory government. I’ve also dreamt about the sea quite afew times. Maybe this is because I would very much like to see the sea, and am wondering whether the summer holiday we have booked in Cornwall is actually going to happen. One ofmy ‘sea’ dreams came after I’d seen a news report about three people from Slough who had broken the lockdown by driving to Dorset. They got stuck on a cliff, and one of them had to swim to Studland Bay (where we were on holiday last year) and alert the coastguard."

A number of us (myself included) have experienced mental health struggles in the past and one of us is currently on anti-depressants and had some anxiety around the start of the lock down about being able to access them, but I believe this has been resolved. I have not experienced any big swings in my emotions during the period (besides feeling angry with the handling of the crisis). We’re all very grateful to be living together as a group of friends (we were all concerned about spending extended periods of time back with family, which is something none of us do that much anymore) and to have a garden which has allowed us to spend a lot of time out in the sun. I have been surprised at myself for not worrying very much and have felt slightly guilty for this. My greatest concern has been for my grandma who is very elderly and lives in a home where there has been an outbreak and about how this must be affecting my mum. I have started to feel some frustration at not being able to do much (though I have always been in favour of stringent lock down measures). However, I think this is a result of being furloughed, meaning I’ve found myself with more time. The government I am extremely frustrated with the way in which the government has handled the crisis. I was annoyed in early March by what I perceived as the government’s experimenting with behavioural science and gambling with lives by not favouring stringent measures to combat the spread of the virus, as other countries were taking these steps. This feeling was heightened during the week of the 16th March when the government simply advised people to stay indoors as much as they could without enforcing the measures. This felt like delaying the inevitable, worsening the spread of the virus and thus driving up the number of deaths and the amount of time we would have to spend in lock down anyway, all, it seems to me, for the sake of attempting to avoid supporting businesses and people affected by the measures. I cannot understand why the UK has consistently disregarded the advice of the WHO (a large proportion of whose funding I understand comes from Britain) in terms of lock downs, testing and contact tracing. Time and again, their advice has proven correct and we have found ourselves playing catch up on these requirements. I have been more impressed by the response and conduct of Rishi Sunak during the crisis. Nevertheless, I feel some of the financial measures, for example, to support the self-employed have been inadequate. Measures like the Job Retention Scheme, meanwhile, came in too late to save some people from being made redundant and I believe if the cabinet had taken the emerging crisis more seriously in the early days (perhaps if Boris Johnson had shown up for some COBRA meetings), then such measures could have been designed and rolled out more quickly. I have developed a particular disdain for Matt Hancock, which I sense I share with quite a lot of people. I’ve really resented his reprimanding tone which he’s maintained consistently throughout the crisis, from criticising members of the public for not following social distancing measures when it was unclear both as to what the measures actually were and whether people were truly disregarding them, to attempting to scapegoat footballers. His tough language appears as nothing more than a front to cover how woefully inept he is in his role, but I hope he doesn’t become the sole scapegoat, if and when proper scrutiny is placed on the government’s handling of the crisis. Ultimately, the way we have approached the emergency and the fact our death toll is what it is, comes down to the political instincts of our Prime Minister, who can’t bear to relay bad news and who once likened himself to the Mayor from Jaws for his libertarian ethos. I’m glad he’s since come around to his senses (though saddened it required a near death experience) and is now fighting his cabinet and backbenchers for the necessary measures to be kept in place as long as needed to avoid a second wave. However, had he shown better judgement in the early stages of this catastrophe, had he paid attention to how the virus was surging in Europe while cases remained in double digits in Britain, then I believe we could have saved many more lives. Following Johnson’s speech outlining the roadmap for an exit from lock down, I believe many people will be going back to work from this week onwards. Companies will feel compelled to do this, I imagine, by fear of not receiving further support through the job retention scheme. However, I’m not convinced social distancing can properly be observed in industries like construction and manufacturing, while not everyone has the luxury of being able to avoid public transport. As such, I think there could yet be a further spike that drives the R-rate above 1, meaning other stages on the roadmap for exit will be further delayed. I think this could also be hampered by a continued lack of testing and PPE, while the government’s baffling decision to change the message from ‘stay at home’ to ‘stay alert’ will surely encourage people to be more brazen in breaking the rules. I think some of the announcements and changes made by Johnson may yet be altered in order to bring England in line with Wales and Scotland. Not doing so will create much confusion, especially for people living near the borders. Though I can’t help being pleased about being able to stay outside for longer, I don’t think we should be trying to move out of lock down too quickly. I understand concerns about how the lock down is adversely affecting some of the worst off in society (and have been made more aware of this through my work) and its impact in deterring people with other serious health needs from going to hospital, but I fear that tempting a severe second wave merely puts such people at even greater risk, should we be forced to undergo another lengthy lock down. As a household, we have also done some speculating as to the broader political shifts that might occur over the coming months, as a result of the national experience of the Coronavirus emergency. We think it might engender a leftward shift in terms of economic policy. An appetite for increased spending was already apparent during the last election and we think (hope) the crisis might emphasise to people that there is money to spend on welfare and basic provision for the neediest in society. In particular, I have read some optimistic analysis around the tackling of the homelessness crisis after the virus. It has become evident during lock down, that with sufficient wherewithal, we can quickly tackle the number of people forced to sleep rough on our streets, that has risen exponentially in recent years. I hope that further provision will be made after lock down to build on this success. The flip side of this, is that such measures could also be taken not so much because of an increase in public generosity, but rather fear. People will be far more aware of the potential spread of disease after the lock down and may view homeless people who lack access to hygiene products and cleaning facilities, as general vectors of contagion, leading to their being further stigmatised by society. Indeed, I believe there will be a more general shift to the right on social issues that will affect public attitudes to other people and how we approach things like freedom of movement. I will not be entirely surprised if economic attitudes also shift in the direction opposite to that I’ve described above. I’ve noticed similarities in the language of Covid welfare and austerity – ‘we’re all in this together’, and have heard of some people reacting to the crisis with an attitude of self-flagellation – chastising people they see in shops buying non­essential items. This indicates a belief that we need to suffer to make the bad things go away which could potentially be taken advantage of to argue for future spending cuts. News I have mostly been following news around the coronavirus via digital media. I regularly check the BBC News website for updates, while I also regularly read The Guardian, especially their opinion pieces. I particularly like The New Statesman’s ‘Morning Call’ daily email which offers really helpful overviews of the day’s news, along with interesting analysis. I have also taken to using Twitter as a means of finding news from a wider range of outlets. At first, everyone in our house watched the government briefings every day but we stopped after about two weeks as we don’t feel there’s much major news coming through now, and it’s easier to read summaries later on. I don’t know anyone who’s had difficulty accessing the news. I wasn’t aware of the petition to include sign language interpreters in the daily briefings, but I intend to find it and sign. I can’t help feeling angry with the media representation of our handling of the emergency, especially by the BBC. I understand they can’t be too partial, but I feel some of their coverage has given far too much slack to the government. For example, I could not believe that they opted for a headline proclaiming the government had met its testing target in April, when the body of the article made clear this simply wasn’t the case as most of the tests were in the post and some needed to be carried out again. I’ve also been reading about concerns that we shouldn’t open schools too soon as their closure has been one of the most effective ways of stopping the spread. This bewildered and infuriated me also because I remember our government was highly reticent to do this in the early days of the crisis, (though most other countries were closing down schools) and it was reported that it wasn’t clear that this was at all effective in stopping the spread. I feel the fact this has changed so fundamentally is being totally ignored by the press and believe we have a right to know why the UK apparently got it so wrong in this respect, as if we had closed schools sooner, then perhaps we could have more effectively stopped the spread of the virus. In the last couple of days, I have seen more stark headlines relating to our death count surpassing those of all other European countries, but generally believe the media coverage of this crisis has been overly sympathetic to the government and encouraged a seemingly apathetical reaction to the government’s handling of the crisis within some sections of society. Work and home life I am currently in the middle of a 3-week furlough period., the charity where I work, took the option to furlough staff about 5 weeks ago and have reduced the Business Development function from 7 to 2 people. I stayed on for the first 3 weeks with my line manager, before swapping with a colleague. In total, we’ve furloughed about 120 out of c.950 staff. It’s not yet clear where the business might be negatively impacted financially by the lock down, but there has been some hope that the Job Retention Scheme might ease some of the organisation’s current financial difficulties. Our union, Unite, have apparently been asking senior leadership about the possibility of reducing the scope of the change programme that is currently being undertaken, having commenced prior to lock down, which will make some staff redundant. I was enjoying work as there was still plenty to do around applying for grants and for funding relating specifically to the Coronavirus emergency. After some fear of being bored, however, I have found furlough to be manageable. The first week was trickier because it mostly rained, but otherwise I have enjoyed spending most days reading in the garden. My relationship with the friends I live with has, if anything, improved during lock down. We were always on good terms, but we have found more ways to bond during this period, from sitting around our chiminea in the garden to Friday night takeaways. Technology I haven’t learnt how to use any technology I wasn’t already familiar with to some extent. As a team at work, we were already well equipped for home working and our work, which is mostly writing, is well suited to it. I’ve been video calling colleagues and friends via numerous means. At work, we use Microsoft Teams and Skype, while I have been using Zoom and Facebook Messenger to call friends as well. My granny has had something set up in her living room that allows her to video call relatives through Facebook at the touch of a button. She’s in her eighties and so not good with technology normally, but says she finds this very easy and I’m very glad she’s had a means of staying in touch with people during this time. The biggest revelation has been WhatsApp’s video calling function which I’d previously not made much use of. I now have all my calls with my mum and dad using it, whereas before lock down, we always just spoke over the phone. In this strange way then, the lock down has brought me slightly closer to my family than usual. I’m staying in touch with quite a few people, though I do sometimes feel the pressure of responding and take several days to get back to people. A friend invited me to join one group that is putting on regular virtual quizzes (something I enjoy and have done a bit of in lock down), but it mostly includes people I don’t know at all well, so I have been ignoring it and feeling bad for doing so. Besides staying in touch with friends, I don’t use social media that much (I have Twitter but don’t tweet) and this has continued in lock down. Shopping and food Prior to lock down, we would do a weekly online shop as a household. However, this quickly became impossible and we wouldn’t have wanted to take up slots and deprive less able-bodied members of the public. Living in London, most of our shops are small and in densely populated areas, so we have experienced some pretty big queues at our local Tesco. Our nearest shop is a small Co-Op however that’s open 24 hours as it’s linked to a petrol station and has fewer people trying to access it, so we’ve been able to use that to source bits and pieces we may forget as part of our larger shops. It also appears people forget about small independent grocery stores and off licences which we’ve also used when we’ve found certain items have run out in supermarkets. In the first couple of weeks of lock down, we found it hard to find everything we wanted in the shops. Though this problem has generally eased, stock levels are still proving a little unpredictable. In particular, I seem to be having peculiar misfortune when it comes to finding courgettes which always appear to have sold out whenever I go shopping. Entertainment and leisure I have entertained myself during lock down through books, films, tv and exercise. I generally try to read a lot but have naturally found myself spending more time with books. Though I normally prefer fiction, I have lately found myself craving factual works, in particular of a contemporary, political nature (whereas, I usually opt for History). Of this canon, I have read Isabel Hardman’s Why We Get the Wrong Politicians (I liked it, though the title is misleading as it’s more about how the system in Westminster prevents MPs, the majority of whom are honest and decent, from doing their jobs properly) and David Runciman’s How Democracy Ends (which I found heartening in it’s compelling thesis that western democracy is not currently in its death throes but rather suffering something of a midlife crisis). I have just started Roger Scruton’s How to be a Conservative (so far, I find his style somewhat impenetrable, though that may reflect more my lack of prior philosophical knowledge and understanding) as I want to understand more about conservatism, despite my more left-leaning politics, since I am conscious of our increasingly living in political echo chambers. In terms of fiction, I have read: . Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie – I’ve become a fan of hers recently and I enjoyed this one, though I guessed the culprits. I always enjoy her satirising of the English upper classes . Trouble with Lichen and Chocky both by John Wyndham – I love his books and so bought these two early in the lock down, as I thought I’d find them comforting. I thought Trouble with Lichen was less riveting than some of his others, (it’s still very good) though remarkable for its outlook on feminism which seemed very progressive for the time he was writing. I really loved Chocky for the way it plays with the reader’s assumptions that the titular alien means their young host harm. I thought the name, Chocky was clever in this regard as it can be read either as something childish and innocent sounding or as invoking the act of choking . Amongst Women by John McGahern – I was really moved by it and the depiction of the central character, the patriarchal Moran who is ultimately unable to control or communicate with his family . Ancient Sorceries and Other Weird Stories – I’d had this on my shelf for some time, having read about his short story, ‘The Willows’ which sounded a lot like a nightmare I remember distinctly from childhood. I loved that story and also ‘The Man Whom the Trees Loved’ . Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut – Finally got round to reading this. Finished it in a day as it’s very short but I did also really like it. Found it a far more optimistic book than I’d been led to believe and, in some places, genuinely very funny. In terms of films, I recently watched Destroyer with Nicole Kidman after my dad recommended it to me. I thought it was very good and did genuinely interesting things with the trope of a troubled detective, by casting a woman in a traditionally male role. I also got round to If Beale Street Could Talk. Having loved the book, I was slightly underwhelmed, but I was also tired when I watched it. I watched a shockingly bad horror film with my housemate, As Above So Below. We’ve also watched a lot of Marvel films which we’ve found fun and welcome escapism. That experience led me to watch Extraction on Netflix as it was made by the same people as the Avengers films, but it was nothing like them in tone, utterly poe-faced, cliched and problematic. My housemate and I also watched the wartime films, Millions Like Us and Dead of Night on the 75th anniversary of VE day. We did this instead of drinking to Churchill’s speech or singing Vera Lynn which we somehow felt was a little over the top... I’ve also managed to watch a few tv series. Like everyone else, I watched Tiger King and Normal People, both of which are really great, though in very different ways. I’ve been watching a lot of the Simpsons for comfort and am also in the middle of Killing Eve’s third series, which we’re largely finding a bit slow. I have been getting more exercise in lock down. I was into running before but have had more time to do it now, just as the weather has got nicer as well. I’ve brought a mat to do yoga in my living room, using Youtube videos and I also succumbed to targeted advertising that recommended resistance bands. These have proven a great purchase as I keep them hanging from my bedroom door, offering a really easy way to get a bit of exercise whenever I want. I’ve also found myself doing a little more DIY than usual (i.e. more than nothing!) I brought a new bookcase and as a house, we purchased an outdoor furniture set that proved tricky to assemble. I also finally fixed the toilet seat in the upstairs bathroom! Personal hygiene I can’t say I’ve noticed too great a change in my hygiene habits during lock down. I like to think I was always pretty good at washing my hands at regular intervals, but I have started to scrub them for longer, though I don’t always remember to do it once I return from trips outdoors. I have showered, dressed, cleaned the house, etc with about the same regularity as usual, I think. Sleep I have been experiencing some difficulty with sleep in recent weeks. I have prior experience with these troubles, and it is partly driven by being off work and not needing to wake up early in the mornings, meaning I stay up later, often looking at white screens. I have also been experiencing more dreams than usual. I do not normally have dreams, or remember them at least, so I presume this is linked to stress I’m experiencing on a subconscious level, during lock down. In one dream, I was riding a horse down Mile End road when I approached an ambulance. Its doors were open and there was another horse inside that was dying. As I got nearer, my own horse became increasingly distressed and crumbled to the floor. Gruesomely, its head became detached from its body and that’s all I can remember. I analysed this a bit with my housemates. We decided it was representative of anxiety felt as a result of rising Covid-19 death tolls but also potentially of societal collapse that might see technological regression! Not all my dreams have been nightmares, however. In one, I came into possession of some form of heirloom which I got valued by an auctioneer at £1.2m. I woke as the bidding soared to £1.4m. Last night, meanwhile, I enjoyed a comical caper in which my housemates and I gave Keir Starmer a lift to the airport to attend a conference in Italy. He was in a bad mood and became understandably very angry when my housemate who was driving took to reversing down a busy dual carriageway, swerving out of the way of oncoming cars. I remember him screaming, “I can’t be stopped in this car by the police, I’m the leader of the Labour party!” Weird."

Spring Directive 2020 – Part 2 Covid19 (Update) Health: On Saturday 14th march my 11-year-old developed a cough, but no temperature. I phoned my boss to see if I could still go to work on the Monday and she said yes. So, me and my husband went to work, and my 8-year-old went to school. On the evening of Monday 16th March, the government announced that any household where 1 person had symptoms had to self-isolate for 14 days!!! Within a few days of this my 8-year-old also developed a cough. Luckily, we had previously visited the doctors for him as he has suspected viral asthma. My husband and I did not get ill. 14 days at home, not even going out for walks was tough! The first day we could go out was such a relief, but also a little scary as the whole country was in lock down by then. My husband returned to work and I worked from home and looked after the children. It was good for me and my husband to have that space! I have found not having time to myself very difficult. My youngest has had a few bouts of coughs since then where he has needed his inhaler and all of us have had cold symptoms on and off, despite social distancing. My youngest has struggled the most with not going to school and seeing people. He is very sociable and needs those interactions with others. He has been sad and angry a lot. Having his birthday has actually helped as it was day all about him and we saw family from the doorstep. Government: I very much feel that it was too little too late. As much as I am finding lock down difficult, I think that we should have done it sooner, and if we had we might have been able to do it for less time! I think that they tried to put the economy before people’s health and that even in that they may have failed. The suggestion of herd immunity was horrific. They talk about protecting the NHs not stopping the virus, which is worrying. I am concerned that they will re-open schools (which are not actually closed to key workers children) too soon as they give in to economic pressure. Although children may not get ill with the virus, they can give it to the staff and take it home to their families. Plus, many school staff are self-isolating for 12 weeks under government advice to ‘vulnerable’ people, my science department has less than half its teachers available at the moment. It feels like we are bumbling through this! News: My husband watches the 5pm briefing every day and he also tracked the death rate for a long time, until I told him that I wasn’t interested. I found it morbid and unhelpful. I do listen to the briefings and have found some government ministers re assuring and interesting and others seem to be clueless and bumbling. I do agree that we should have BSL interpreters and are surprised that we don’t, no one should be excluded from something so important. I find Facebook problematic as people share a lot of unfounded information and some downright scaremongering rubbish. Even mainstream news outlets like newspapers have shared information as though it is fact when it is actually speculation. My brother messaged me to say have I seen Boris announcement garden centres will re-open, picnics will be allowed, and schools go back end of May. Boris had made no such announcement it was a newspaper article speculating on what he might say! Work and home life: As a teacher I am supposed to be working from home. I have twice daily online meetings at 9am and 3pm. I have to set work and answer pupils emails as well as help with planning for next year and undertaking training. At first, I found it really difficult to manage work and getting my own children to do their schoolwork and to try something creative each day. I have had to relax my expectations and not feel guilty about not doing my schoolwork during the school day and sometimes doing it of an evening. My children are capable of a lot more schoolwork than they are doing but they miss being in the classroom with their friends, so I don’t push them too hard. Technology: I have learnt to use Microsoft Teams for my meetings with colleagues. It has been nice to see peoples faces and to have a set routine. Zoom has been sued for my dance classes and has had its ups and downs, it can be a pain when the sound and picture are slightly out of sync .I don’t like Houseparty is not easy to use and doesn’t seem very secure. Facebook has become a lifeline. I find some of my Facebook friends have become more important, and more inspiring, than, my ‘real life’ friends. It can be a double-edged sword though with so much mis information shared! The one thing that I have refused to do is to learn to use Microsoft Forms for work. I figured that there are other ways of getting feedback on students such as GCSE pod and didn’t see the point in the time investment. Shopping and Food I have found this irritating as I have always shopped online and now, I cannot book a delivery slot as everyone is doing it. I also hate time wasting so really don’t like queuing to get into a supermarket. I have managed to book a regular fruit and veg box delivery and have had 2 meat boxes delivered. My husband picks up anything else that we need from our local co-op on his way home from work. We did find pasta and flour very difficult to get hold of in the beginning. Things seem to be settling down now, however when I did and Asda click and collect order recently had 9 missing items, on of which was my son’s birthday cake and 10 substitutes! Entertainment and Leisure: I seem to have less spare time than a lot of people as I am still working from home and I am starting to hate the pressure I feel through social media to achieve something during lockdown. We have managed to decorate (mostly hubby) and tidy-up//re-arrange downstairs, this was mostly to help with my mental state as I am spending so much time inside and I like neatness and order. I danced before this and still manage to do 3 zoom classes with my regular dance teacher every week. It is different doing solo jazz rather than Lindy hop, bit there is no alternative. I miss walking as we did this a lot, so I also try and fit in a Karen Hauer workout from YouTube or Facebook mist days. My husband and I have watched the Witcher and are currently watching series 2 of Jack Ryan. We needed new TV to watch together. I read and do puzzles as much as I did before all of this and I have managed to do some paintings, which I had been struggling to find time for. Personal Hygiene: I am gutted that my grey roots are really coming through, I usually have pink hair! However, I am not willing to dye it myself as I don’t want to ruin it. My hubby made me use the clippers on his hair, it wasn’t great. Both my boys need haircuts, but I am not willing to make a mess of it. We all shower and get dressed as much as usual; my only concession is that I may go a day longer between washing my hi rans shaving my legs. Sleep: I am having a lot of trouble sleeping. My body and my brain are both not tired enough. One of the reasons I have started exercising more is to make myself physically tired, but even then, I am not always mentally tired enough to sleep. I am going to bed late a lot in the hopes that I will fall asleep easier."

Not having to get up early to drop the kids at breakfast club and get myself to work has meant that I have had no incentive to go to bed early.  For the first week I spelt in late every morning. After national lockdown came in it was a bit of a shock to have to get up in time for an 8:30 teams meeting every day.  I still didn’t manage to make myself go to bed early, I have spent nearly 6 months now going to be late and getting up late.  When I return to work in September I am going to have to alter my going to be and getting up routine by about 3 hours! I found that surprisingly, the days flew by; I had work meetings at 8:30am (eventually changed to 9am) and 3 pm.  This gave me quite a short working day, especially with a significant lunch break, as I had 3 people to feed.  I found it hard to fit in my work, helping the kids with their work and some exercise for us all.  This was made more difficult by the fact that my husband goes to bed early (8pm,) as he goes to work early and I had Zoom dance classes 3 evenings a week at 6pm.  Dance classes had a big impact as it meant everyone else had to be quiet so that I could hear the lesson, so effectively the living room was off limits for an hour.   I found myself quite envious of people who were sharing all the enrichment opportunities that they were taking up with their children on Facebook,  as this as not an option for me with increased work responsibilities.  I had to set lessons, respond to students’ emails, undertake CPD, re write the curriculum for next year and provide online support sessions, not to mention the centre assessed grades for this years GCSE cohort.  I felt like my own children were missing out.  I also struggled with a lack of exercise as I was used to attending several dance classes and 1 aerobics class a week, plus being on my feet all day at work.  Not getting enough exercise affected my mood and my sleeping patterns.  I had to try and prioritise it some days, and use the active well being societies free online sessions. Due to travel restrictions we spent a lot of time walking in the local area.  We discovered ‘new’ parks that we hadn’t been to before and enjoyed watching the seasons change.  Bird song seemed louder wherever we went and we even had a heron in our local park for the first time ever. I am not sure what changes September will bring.  I know that my working day will be very different, with 3, 100 minute lessons a day and less breaks rather 5, 60 minute lessons, plus a break and a lunchbreak.  Also, I don’t know if my dance lessons will be able to return as normal, so may have to try and fit online classes into my working week.  Homelife: My job helped to set a timetable for us as I had meetings at the start and end of the day.  This was also aided by my eldest child returning to school in June.  We went through several versions of a timetable over the months.  So we started with mornings for work and afternoons for creativity.  My kids got tired of this though and I missed exercise so we tried to include that in it too.  The lack of exercise and stimulation caused sleeping problems for both me and my boys (but not my husband).  Eventually as my youngest got more and more fatigued, it became a case of getting things done at whatever time suited us that day, and sometimes doing double school work one day so that he could have another day off. I think that we all missed having a proper routine, and that my job massively impacted out home life, particularly my teams meetings.  I had to return to work 1 day a week, which meant that my youngest got to go to school for that day and he loved it.  The one positive from my job is that it kept us aware of the days if the week and of time moving forward.     As I have already mentioned, trying to keep up with my dance classes and doing them live on zoom impacted family life.  It meant that dinner had to be eaten by a certain time and that everyone had to either be quiet or find another room to be in whilst my class was going on.  It also lead to us feeling like Thursday was the start of the weekend as my classes were over my then so we had more freedom.  Media and technology: Microsoft teams ahs been essential to my job; it is how I have stayed connected to my department everyday and it has allowed us to offer academic support sessions to students.  Teams will continue to be used for daily briefings in September as we still have to socially distance.  We have even used it for a Friday night drinks catch up.  Its also been used by my husband’s workplace for Monday night quizzes (although these had to run on trust as we were making our own). I have used WhatsApp more too, we have a work group and a wellbeing group.  It has also allowed us to video call family.  My mother in law uses the phone a lot more now, she used to only say a few words before hanging up, now we have whole conversations! One way I have used technology less is for shopping; I used to regularly do my grocery shopping inline, but found myself unable to book a slot due to an increase in demand because of covid-19.  This meant a change in my shopping habits; I have planned meals less and sent my husband to the shops more often as he was going out to work everyday anyway.  Eventually I managed to get a regular fruit and veg box deliver, thanks to Facebook. Waiting: I had to wait from March until July 6th for a hair appointment, I used to go every 5 weeks.   I found this quite difficult as ,y hair has been pink and I have grey roots coming through.  As a result of lockdown I have decided to grow out the pink and have a metallic grey dye put through my hair as this is closer to my natural colour (and I wont get a chance to grow my roots out without seeing people again). My dental surgery has seen my children but still aren’t seeing adults for routine appointments so I am still waiting for that.  My son was given an inhaler for possible asthma before lockdown and he has not had a follow up appointment since then to review his asthma care.  Conversely when I had to go to A&E for a burn and when I had to take my son because he banged his head after fainting, the wait was far less than usual. On area that I have been reluctant to wait is in supermarket queues.  I have avoided going to shops as I hate wasting time queueing!"

No pain, but each of us has lost a bit of filling and would like to have the problem seen to in case it develops into infection or a bigger problem. Additionally, I had a neck/shoulder pain over New Year that persisted, alleviated for a while by a physiotherapy session and an exercise regime, but a vague ache in my upper left arm slowly got worse, and then a sensation like a mild electric shock and numbness started. I didn’tdo anything about it, as we had a couple of trips planned, and it was intermittent. Then lockdown started. I took the odd paracetamol when it became too persistent, kept doing the exercises, but it got worse, so I eventually rang the GP: she diagnosed torticollis (wryneck), for which she would normally suggest physiotherapy, but as this wasn’t currently an option, I should go online for appropriate exercises and when Physiotherapy is once more available, she would refer me for it if I still had the problem. Emotionally, we are fine. We regret not being able to meet friends and family, but this is lessened by contact via FaceTime/Skype/WhatsApp videoing. We regret having had to forego 2 long distance walks April/June, and further summer and autumn away plans, but in the greater scheme of things, those are unimportant. We are pursuing enjoyable activities: gardening, painting (woodwork, not art!), virtual meetings with friends/family, online courses, writing for theMOA project, spring cleaning/pruning surplus “stuff”, reading, French for 2 groups currently suspended, short walks, meals/breaks in the garden (the good weather helps enormously), sharing humorous photos/videos/music/jokes with family and friends, some TV (not too much news, mainly feel good programmes, or the odd French film or thriller series). If this continues into the winter, being indoors more could be frustrating, but we have our interests, and hopefully would get out walking sometimes. Government Decisions: I loathe this government. I feel intense anger for their: . failure to get a grip on this pandemic when, with the benefit of seeing what was happening in other countries first, they had time and knowledge to prepare but didn’t; . utter ineptitude over protective clothing provision for health and care workers; . responsibility for, I believe, many thousands of preventable deaths (current excess number of deaths is 60,000); . evident belief that rules they impose apply to us, the hoi poloi, but they, the Entitled Establishment, can flout them (see Dominic Cummings) at will; . corruption in diverting vital funds from deprived areas to Tory councils for CV19 services. Sadly, we can’t shed them any time soon, but I hope/fantasise that they, or at least their greed-based philosophy, short-termism and determination to sell off every public good, will be extinguished as a political force, and that we will take from this mess a more civilised, caring, responsible society, which recognises that we are mutually dependent, in which we are all prepared to contribute enough to ensure important work, no matter how humble, deserves a living wage enough for families to live securely and safely on without the need for food banks, and in which we act meaningfully on the climate change crisis. Future Government Steps: . Assuming no miracle vaccine or sudden disappearance of CV19, what I think they will do will be habituate us all to a higher incidence of CV19 deaths as a fact of life. I might have become paranoid, but the story that circulated, which inspired Dillie Keane’s“Song for Dominic Cummings”1 has a strong ring of truth to it to me. Just as UK citizens got used to war in 1940-45, we could become used to a pandemic, much higher death rate. The old will have to stay in for at least another year –or accept a much higher risk of CV death than younger people, who might in the end survive as herd immunity develops. . The government won’t keep paying people not to work.They didn’t learn from other countries at the outset, but they will certainly be motivated to get the drones back to work ASAP, and not lag behind other countries. So they will “encourage”people intoany work by stopping CV lockdown funding the moment they can get away with it. . There will be a huge increase in unemployment. The government will divert the unemployed onto the inadequate Universal Benefit, and there will be more gig economy/zero hours work pushed in people’s wayas the only work available. News: . We wake to the 7AM BBC Radio 4 Today programme news headlines.  When we can’t stand it any longer (around 13 mins), J bangs the off button and we start the day. . I glance through online newspapers on my phone: The Guardian, The Independent, The Conversation, BBC, & Apple News which gives other newspaper headlines etc. . We avoid the news most days otherwise. I will sometimes listen to the 6PM radio 4 news if cooking dinner, but not often for the entire 30 minutes. . I almost never listen to the 5PM daily Govt broadcast, and the most recent one I heard, fronted by Priti Patel just angered me more, confirming that I have more useful things to do with my time. They’ve adopted the ruse of taking questions from the general public before press(pretending “theimportance” of their public, but it’saway of reducing press questions), which they fail to answer then ensure no follow-up questions, ditto the press. Makes me so angry, their appearance of calm control belying the ineptitude beneath. And their weasel words whenever criticized that they are See end following the science, ie getting ready to blame the scientists. Which reminds me, I should have added “cowardice” totheir above shortcomings. . I wholeheartedly agree thatBSL should beused as it is in Scotland. I’ve notice Nicola Sturgeon using it and it is positive. Work and Home Life: We are both retired, as are most of our (Boomer) friends, so all we learn about being furloughed, homeschooling etc has come from what our nieces have told us. Job futures are a worry for them (and for us, of course, we worry how they will manage in the future, for example, 1 niece and her partner bought a more expensive house last year, to be nearer Gatwick, where her partner C is an EasyJet pilot……but that could well be at risk now, and then how will they manage their mortgage? My niece has a 3 year old daughter, so can’tgo to work and earn enough,should her partner lose his job, since her former career was in the finance sector, and they will be in the quagmire now). We are at home much more than we have been in many years. J has itchy feet, and we have an aged caravan, so for as long as I can remember, we have been off like a shot for holidays, abroad or at home, sightseeing and hiking, visiting friends in Germany, USA, France as well as having them come stay with us; also quite an active social life locally –so, we have been at home now, entirely alone, since 22nd March, most of the time in the house. It SHOULD bea strain, but it isn’t.We are both fortunate to have a house that is large enough for us to do our own thing in, as well as together; a garden where we can get exercise gardening, fresh air and privacy. We have more activities and interests to pursue than we easily have time for, so enforced quarantine is proving useful in catching up a bit with these! We have developed virtual contactwith friends and family. We can’t go shopping, but earlier anxiety has dissipated,since Morrison’s, our local supermarket chain, expanded its delivery service. And we have refined our established meal planning to a week or more ahead, instead of days. In fact, we think it possible that we will continue to have deliveries, in the wished-for event that this pandemic ever goes away and isn’t replaced by something worse. Friends who go to collect pre-ordered farm shop goods always offer to get things we might need, and between us, neighbours look out for each other. Technology: We never used FaceTime before, but do now on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings with 2 other couples, enjoying wine, and playing Perudo or Trivial Pursuits with one of them. Family and several friends: we’ve discovered WhatsApp video contact, and thatcomesin useful with one of my sisters and her 3 daughters. We speak to my sister every Sunday morning over coffe/tea, but catch up with the nieces haphazardly, depending on their infants’ cooperation!  The infants sometimes assuming IT’S ALL ABOUT THEM! And of course it is, really. They are all much-loved infants, the brightest, most talented ones in the whole world, of course. Two nieces (1 in England, 1 in Spain): Friday night get together: was via WhatsApp, but moved to Skype –improved sight and sound. Friends on Monday afternoon: was WhatsApp, nowtryingSkype, but it’s the blind leading the blind, without my technology-generation nieces to sort us out. I have a FaceBook account, but not sure why. All I ever do with it is post worthy causes and petitions on it so I guess my limited range of recipients take cover when they see another post from me! Definitely not interested in Twitter (too Trumpish) or Instagram. J complains enough about how I’ve become an annoying mobile phone user, checking alland anything every minute, so I don’t want to annoy him further; nor in fact doI really want to become a device-addict. So, no more new gadgets or Apps! Shopping & food: It took us a while, but after the first 3 weeks following lockdown, when we were dependent on friends for shopping from their deliveries/click&collect, we managed to get onto Morrison’s delivery list and it’sbecome much easier/quicker. Mind you, we have an impressively stocked pantry, but all tins, packets, dried goods etc., so still needed the perishables. We did order goods from Holland & Barrett, some specialist things from eBay eg bulk dried mushrooms & tomaotes, and some food flavourings. We’ve been shopping once, some 2 weeks ago: to Holland & Barrett for wheat gluten to use with non-bread flour, only we can’tgetwholewheat flour of any sort atall. Delivery shopping has encouraged us to do even more meal planning, not just for the next few days, but for a week+, including cataloguingallthe contents of our 2.5 freezers……Jworked for hisfirst year after graduating as a work study officer, and he still bears all the hallmarks of being a natural. Hence the catalogue. Once I’d stopped falling about laughing at the idea, I caved in. It’sagood idea! But I’m not letting him anywhere near my books. And we are trying to reduce the pantry hoards.  Since our savings are rapidly diminishing, its no bad thing to adopt some saving ways. We overbought the first time or two, though wasted nothing (we were raised by WW2 Make Do & Mend parents. It sticks) –those 2.5 freezers earned their keep. As for eating: yes, we are eating differently. We’ve been having too many biscuits with mid-morning and mid-afternoon drink breaks: gingernuts and chocolate hobnobs being the addiction. So, finding we have little self-control, we’ve agreed to have none in the morning, and only 2 each in the afternoon. Which isn’t great, butisa whole lot better than the near-gorgingwe’d abandoned ourselves to hitherto, since lockdown. Having adopted the 5 : 2 diet some 3 years ago, and each having lost best part ofacouple of stone, we’ve been reasonably sensible (except maybe holidays/parties)…. until early April, by when wewere colluding in increased self-indulgence: not enough distractions, maybe? We’ve certainly been busy, and are now even busier having embarked ona wholesale painting job, but it’s awfully easy to develop the habit of taking a break morning and afternoon, wander into the warm sunny garden with a cuppa andaplate of biscuits or cake….. Otherwise, we are eating healthily: the usual cereal & toast breakfast, lunch (maybe more vegetable soups than usual, mainly to consume the rather excessive amount of root veg we seem to keep buying), an evening meal: often a varied salad and fish or omelette or stuffed mushrooms; sometimes meat, often not, and fruit (mostly oranges) or home made rhubarb or apple or gooseberry crumble with plain yoghurt. But it’s mostly what weate B.CV. Entertainment & Leisure: . J plays chess fairly steadily on his iPad, but he did that B.CV. . We e-socialise as described earlier. DEFINITELY A NEW SKILL. . Gardening (more than we ever did before, but that’sbecause B.CV, we did the absolute minimum! . 3-4 mile walks through deserted building site/commercial & industrial estates c. x3p.w. Did knee and neck exercises for a while to ease arthritis and torticollis problems, but they’ve dwindled ‘cos they’re boring.We used to do a lot of walking and are missing it, but feel reluctant to go beyond the set lockdown limits or go in the parks too often, because runners, cyclists, young people, family groups aren’t thatcareful about social distancing. . Music whilst we work: J Spotify (blues & folk tendency); me Classic FM. . I did an online Genealogy course via FutureLearn, and have now started an Irish Language & Culture, with more courses to follow if I can cram them into our busy days! Which start at 7AM and finish not usually before 9PM, before an hour of TV usually then bed . And of course the Forth Bridge project: the much-needed repaint of all our woodwork and doors, preceded by spring cleaning preparation. . TV viewing: mostly feel good programmes eg The Repair Shop, Jamie Oliver’s Keep Cooking & Carry On, Would I Lie To You?, French films we’ve recorded or found in charity shops in the past & French thrillers eg via Walter Presents on Channel 4, some documentaries eg BBC4’s AndrewMarr’s History of Modern Britain/ Music for Tyrants/The Georgians. We studiously avoid too much news, other than 10-15 minutes radio headlines at 7AM, partly because so much is exclusively CV related navel gazing, speculative, political spin; notbalanced with serious news about what’s happening elsewhere, where people are far worse off than we are. I find our selfish, ignorant self-preoccupation hard unendurable. . Reading: J historical adventures or fact checking/statistically based books (not heavy academic ones, more those that become briefly best sellers eg Factfulness. Currently alongwith his novel, he’s reading The Art of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter…. Well, he taught Economics, so it’s probably lightbedtime reading!); his current novel is a Simon Scarrow one about Napoleon and Wellington. My reading includes Jacqueline Winspear’s Maisie Dobbs and Lindsey Davis’ Flavia Albiaand Jane Thynne’s Clara Vine stories, The Week magazine when it’sa week or two old after J finishes with it (I don’t wantitwhen it’s fresh), and I’ve just started reading a book a friend sent me she has just had published called The Mistress, the Matriarch and the Virgin Queen, about 3 key women in the Tudor dynasty saga. Personal Hygiene: Much the same as it was B.CV. Gardening and DiY in this weather encourage showers. But I’ve become much more slopping about clothes-wise at home: baggy, elastic-waisted jogging pants and T-shirts. The rare occasion we go out, I change into something a little tidier eg trousers and blouse or the very occasional skirt (I rarely wear these any more, other than for hot weather). I’ve realised also thatwhilstI wash underwear and bath towels after one use, outer clothing I’ve been wearing maybeup toaweek before laundering, unless worn away from home, in which case they are put immediately in the washing machine, as soon as we return home. I feel comfortable clumping about the house in my slops, but if and when it’s safe to go out openly again, I shall have to remind myself that one has to make more of an effort if visiting or being visited by friends. J’s style has always been casual. Nothing new there then. I’m also much fussier about cleaning loos, sinks and kitchen surfaces frequently than previously: not just because our cleaner is currently not coming to us, but because of CV for some reason. My hair needed urgent cutting because my last hair appointment was 23rd March, which I cancelled. I wear my hair short, and it was really irritating me, so I surrendered and allowed J to cut it for me. A truly terrifying experience, watching him flail at my hair with scissors, but despite some slightly eccentric bits that needed later attention when he wasn’tlooking, to my surprise, he didn’t doa bad job. So, I might just have to risk letting him doit again. I’ve done hisfor years, so nothing new there. Sleep: No insomnia or nightmares. I go out almost like a light, not quite as immediately as J, and wake around dawn, mainly because of the heat outside, I think, but drowse comfortably till 7AM and the radio alarm. I don’t thinkmy sleeping pattern is any different from B.CV. But maybe that’ because we spenda lot of time outdoors and gardening & DiY are quite tiring. I tend not to remember dreams, nothing new there. Once I would have lain awake chewing over the ills of society, the world, the politicians, whatever dominated, but since a fairly protracted time of family illness and bereavement between 20and 10 years ago, whenI couldn’t control my compulsion to find solutions, and sleep was wrecked for a long time.I wasn’tgood at acceptingthatI couldn’t fix everything. But eventually, somehow I did adapt to that understanding, and I think that is standing me in good stead now. I feel such a fury at so much in the news, but I limit the news I hear/see/read, and keep busy. So I sleep well. As does J who has always had that annoying “If there’sno solution, there’snoproblem” attitude. Butitworks for him! Dillie Keane’s “Song for Dominic Cummings” on the occasion of her 68th birthday:"

But whatisa problem for me is thatthereisno access at allto dentistry -and I have severe toothache. AlsoI need my cataractdoing, I was going  have it done in the summer but will have to post­pone. Ido have insomnia and it is terrible since the lockdown-I barely sleep at all. It’s just anxiety. Generally my health is good but I havea bad back and am affected by not beingable to go to excersice classes and the osteopath. My emotions are all over the place.I am very anxious and I feel hostile to some of my friends The Government I am a Labour voter and I hate these Tory poltroons. They have totally mismanaged everythingand are responsiblefor thousand of deaths. I haveno confidence in them at all. They do not care aboutthe weak. They only care about profits. News I was watchingBBC news quite often butIactually threwa cupatthe screen and broke the TV. Now usingan old one. The daily press broadcasts area disgrace-dis­honest, misinformed, complacent. The sign language thing isa disgrace too. But the Tories have conducteda war on the disabled anyway.. The BBC is their tool.I often look at Al-Jazeera. Work and home life I have retired technically, but my first fiction book came out just after lockdown and I’ve been very busy promoting that.I madea YouTube film of some of the storiesfor the localArts Centre and I had to updatemy website.I’ve had to use technology more thanI ever did and I’ve found ita challenge but I hadno choice. I have never spent so much time with my husband.We’ve been married 50 years.I am beginning to find it very constraining. It was fine whenI could get out and have my own life but I feel very confined and controlled.I’mvery irritable. And I’mnot man­aging it very well. Technology See above. I havedone my excersice class on Zoom and Facebook Messenger for my writing group.I use Facebook and emaila lot more than I did before. Shopping and food Well I am not an early riser and the fact that the oldies can go tothe first hour of opening isn’t much use to me, but I found out that Waitrose opens at 10 ona sunday so I get there at 9.30 and sail through.

This is odd.I used to reada great deal and look ata lot of films-I’ma film historian after all-but I have been unable to concentrate much. Now most of the viewing takes place not in the sitting room but in the kitchen or the bedroom and I’meither cooking or drunk (or both).I can’t concentrate becauseI’mso anxious.  I have donea great deal of gardening, which likea lot.Iused to havea gardener but she left with the Covid outbreak. So I doit all. Also we havea very nice dog and he likes to go to the beach and we haven’t been able to-(though god knows why-far easier to social distance there) so we’ve just had to walk round the local area. When I broke my leg  years ago and was confined,  I dida lot ofreading and I thought I could do that in the lockdown butI can’t geta quiet mind. Hygiene. This is odd. My husband has growna beard.I myself was always very keen about being groomed and I went to the beautician and hairdresser a lot and dressed nicely. Now I just don’t bother. .I clean my teeth obviously but I don’t shower as often as I did and I wear the most frightfulgardening clothes all the time. I look likea baglady.

The week before the lockdown I developed a dry cough and achiness, so much so I ended up in bed one day, and whilst I felt unwell, it felt more like an illness which didn’t go anywhere. The first week of May my partner, D, suffered “peculiar” stomach cramps, which he said felt more muscular than intestinal. After 3-4 days in bed with a fever and dodgy guts, he’s now recovered. Whether either have been Covid19 we haven’t a clue, as testing availability is limited solely to key workers and hospital inpatients, and even they seem to be having great difficulty accessing tests. Beyond illness, we’ve all been coping well with the lockdown. I’m quite happy to laze around the house and spend my time relaxing, as are the children and D. We are missing going out visiting places and I’m missing the gym far more than I expected I would. I’ve been for a couple of early morning runs, but I don’t enjoy those as much as I enjoyed the gym. D would cycling the 4 miles to work and back every day, and because we’ve been avoiding going out, even for our daily 1 hour exercise, both for fear of catching Covid19, but also because the streets and parks are busy and dull, we’ve both put on a bit of weight, but not significant amounts, thankfully! Mentally, myself and D have both been OK in the main during lockdown. I’ve had a couple of tears over frustrating things – the washing machine broke (thanks, random 10p spinning at 1600rpm!), but otherwise mostly fine. It’s as we start to head towards the lifting of lockdown, that I’m feeling more anxious. L, our 11 year old, is in year 6, so one of the first cohort of students the government want to return to school. His school has phoned and explained the situation -maximum of 15 students to a class, one teacher, they do everything in this 15-student ‘bubble’ -lessons, playtime and lunchtime -but they likely won’t be sat more than 1 metre apart, and whilst things should be OK in the classroom, they can’t guarantee children won’t get closer than that at breaktimes, no matter how much they police their play. Therefore, we told them he won’t be returning just yet. I’m hoping that by July the situation will have improved, so I’m considering sending him back then, but that remains to be seen. At home, the children are getting exercise via the trampoline, which they spend a lot of time on. Mentally, I think they’re both struggling. F, the 8 year old, has become more babyish in his behaviour, which is incredibly irritating, he’s also a few major meltdowns over innocuous things – his brother made some jelly and he wanted to, so he screamed for half an hour. He’s been reluctant to speak to friends or family via Skype etc. L has cried a few times because he’s missing his friends, but he does at least get to chat to them daily via the Xbox. We don’t really know how to better deal with this, it being such a novel experience for us all, but there are lots of cuddles and love for them. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I have regular medication and use a locally-based but online pharmacy, and they’ve been fantastic -dropping prescriptions off when due but masked and gloved and not stopping for the usual chat. Beyond that, we’ve not needed any help. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Mostly quite cheerful. We’re very fortunate in that we have a fairly large lush-with-greenery garden and the weather has been hot and sunny, so we are making the most of that luxury. I’m also working from home, albeit my usual part-time hours, so I’ve plenty to keep me occupied. I suspect if I was unable to work and had to focus more on the children’s schoolwork I would be struggling. Other than a couple of bouts of tears, I’ve been remarkably upbeat, although today I’ll a little teary after seeing 90 of my colleagues for the first time via Zoom and receiving confirmation that out holiday is cancelled -not that we’d have gone anyhow! D has been furloughed for the past month, so has taken over the bulk of the home schooling. It’s become apparent the novelty of the whole experience has worn off for him, as he was initially keep cheerful and had plenty to keep himself occupied, but the past week, he’s been quite down. I suspect frustration with the monotony and home schooling, but also because we’ve no holiday to look forward to this year -we were due to visit the Netherlands for two over the Whitsun half term, but that’s been cancelled. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Diabolical. I think the Government have made heinous errors at every step: . Stockpiling insufficient PPE and ignoring emails from the EU regarding PPE and the results of a 2015 report into Britain’s preparedness for a pandemic, resulting in insufficient masks, ventilators, protective gowns, sanitiser and more, resulting in thousands of avoidable deaths. . Focusing upon Brexit instead of planning for the obvious imminent crisis . Locking down too late and then in a confused and minimal way. We should have locked down fully and early. . Losening the lockdown too early -the cases and deaths are still too high, there’s no plan for travelling to work, other than by car, which will dramatically increase pollution levels again and lead to packed roads, plus they’ve released no advice as to how businesses should be making the workplace safe for staff and customers. . Leaving the borders open, so visitors from infected countries could arrive and disappear into the community with no testing or quarantine in place. . Emptying hospitals of all but the most poorly patients, many going to care homes, but with no testing, so thousands of care home staff and residents have now died. . A lack of testing and when testing was available making it nigh on impossible to access. Claims that they’d have tested 100,000 people by the end of April 2020 were only reached by counting tests sat in the post and the number of tests rather than people -so if an individual was tested twice, they counted as two people. . No testing available for non-keyworker people to date. . Handing contracts to produce at that point undersigned ventilators to Dyson, as major Tory donors, rather than existing companies already building successfully tested equipment. . Announcing the re-opening of schools to some cohorts, despite the death and infection rates being highly than they were when schools closed, as well as providing no clear guidelines and support to schools to implement improved hygiene standards and social distancing. I understand that the government have been claiming to follow the Danish return to school model, completely ignoring the face Denmark is returning from an entirely different point -they have fewer current cases, their R rate is much lower, they locked down harder and earlier than the UK, they have provided additional funding to schools to install items such as additional sinks and have opened sports stadiums to students to relieve spatial pressures in classrooms. None of this has been replicated in the UK. . Expecting already cash-strapped local authorities to fund the dramatic changes needed within social care, schools and transport systems, with minimal, if any, additional funding. . That Sage included Dominic Cummings and random friends, is heinous. . That the government is ignoring advice from Sage is also peculiar. . The government’s chosen track and trace phone app is designed by well-known data miners Cambridge Analytica, associates of Dominic Cummings. Positively: . The furloughing scheme has been helpful. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Things are re-opening too swiftly -already the slight lifting of lockdown restrictions has meant public transport is hugely busier than it has been and therefore the second wave of infections is imminent. I think that we will return to a lockdown situation, and therefore it’s unlikely schools will reopen from the 1st June. I anticipate some widespread antibody testing to establish whether people have had Covid-19 being made available, undoubtedly this will be beset with problems. They’ll reopen shops, bars and restaurants, and although I think social distancing will remain in place for some time, I anticipate a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. I’m expecting the furloughing 80% pay coverage to shrink to perhaps 60% and for Universal Credit to be reduced. The government will continue to twist and lie about their actions in order to deflect the blame for the thousands of unnecessary deaths. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Usually through social media or the Guardian website. I feel sick to my core when I see some of the newspaper front pages. Tens of thousands of people have died in Britain and they’re bleating on about what a wonderful job the government have done. I feel like I’m in a parallel universe. I’m taking every media report with a huge pinch of salt, and have done so since the beginning of the Brexit furore, whereby there media were pedalling so many obvious lies and not challenging the government over these relentless untruths, I don’t really believe any of them can be trusted. Today I managed to get into a Twitter row with an idiot who thinks we shouldn’t question the government, because they’re doing the best they can do. How? What exactly have they done their best at? It’s all been very shoddy and half-arsed. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Occasionally, if we think there’s some especially important updates to hear. Mostly, it’s been a waste of time and we find ourselves swearing loudly at the TV, as yet another politician makes another stupid or untrue statement. The biggest frustration is the lack of questioning of Johnson from the media. Most journalists are just accepting what the government are telling them, without challenging them over some of the nonsense they’re spouting. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? This has been fine for us, but I feel embarrassed I’d not considered access issues previously. BSL interpreters and any other support for people with disabilities is an essential, which should have featured from the very beginning. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Initially both myself and D were working from home and I was also trying to manage the children with their schoolwork. This was incredibly difficult, partly because I felt quite overwhelmed with my workload at the start -lots of panicking staff and students emailing me, as well as new technologies to familiarise myself with. I was also working on my fairly small screened laptop at the kitchen table, so was struggling to see all the information I wanted on the monitor. On top of this, I was being interrupted constantly by the children chattering to me or wanting help with their work. D was using a desktop PC in the bedroom as he’s paid more than me and has more virtual meetings, so it made sense. D was furloughed after about four weeks, which made my life significantly easier! I can now hide away and get on with my work, without constant interruptions. I have found WFH enjoyable, but I am finding it hard to concentrate, and still feel like I’m playing catch-up with my work. The panicked demands have mostly dried up, which is a relief, but I’m aware of so many nice things I could be doing at home -ooh look at that book, ooh, there’s a bird on the feeder, ooh, next door are out with their new puppy. My employers have been fantastic throughout this. Everybody is working incredibly hard to set up online teaching just in case we need it by Sept, but we’re waiting on the University to make a decision. The support has been great, and they recognise that everybody is having good and bad days, so if you’re struggling, they happy for you to finish work early, or as many people have caring responsibilities, work around them. The communication’s been regular, both within the Library and from the University’s senior management team, and whilst I appreciate much of what they’re saying may be designed to alleviate the concerns of staff, I have felt reassured that the future of the institution is as stable as it could be, and we’re unlikely to be facing the serious issues around long-term viability other places will be facing. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Home life has undoubtedly been impacted upon -not least because we’ve been home schooling two children! We’ve been very fortunate that I became ill with a mysterious cough and achiness the week before the lockdown, so started isolating then, at exactly the same time as one of our neighbours and her two children, so we took the decision to isolate with them. LR and MR are slightly older than L and very kind, thoughtful children, so all four children have played well together most weekends and evenings. We’ve spent a lot of time with their mother, C, albeit the adults are still distancing, but lots of chats over the fence and we did sit opposite ends of our patio area with a cup of tea one day! Even that felt a bit naughty, but given none of us had been near anybody else for weeks, it felt low risk. We’ve also spent a lot of time talking to our other neighbour G over the fence. I feel like we’ve definitely developed firm friendships with some super neighbours! We’ve all missed our friends. D runs a local weekly music club which took up a lot of his time so he’s missing that. I don’t go out much anyhow, but am desperate for a meal out or a few drinks with my friends, but I have had a few WhatsApp chats and drinks with a couple of friends. Both D and I are quite argumentative -we don’t often have full-blown rows, but we do bicker, and I had been concerned that the lockdown forcing us into closer proximity would increase those arguments, however, maybe because we’ve had less day-to-day pressure on us, we’ve rarely exchanged a sharp word over the past couple of months, and have undoubtedly been getting on better! The children have been arguing quite a lot, and I think much of that is around anxiety, although F does as all younger siblings do, and follows L around, wanting to play with him and being quite annoying to L. We have noticed however, that their relationship improves dramatically when L has a device ban, so may be exploring that a bit more… Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? At home I’ve made more use of Skype and the WhatsApp video function to speak to friends and family. However, it’s at work where I’ve being using more technology -Zoom and Skype for Business for team meetings, both of which were a pain to set up on my laptop, although I have no idea why, as they were straightforward on the desktop PC! We’ve also got a selection of resources to use for teaching sessions, so a colleague and I ran a Library session for a group of postgraduate students last week using New Row via our Virtual-Learning Environment, Moodle, which was very successful, but definitely needed two of us to manage, at least for a first go. At some point we’ll be trying out Microsoft Teams, Adobe Connect and explore more of the functionality of Zoom and how that could help with online teaching. No doubt there’ll be other technologies emerging on to the market over the next few months, which we’ll also test-drive. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re­connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I’ve used WhatsApp and Skype to speak to friends and family and Zoom and Skype for Business to speak to colleagues. These have been good. A couple of days ago the University’s head librarian arranged a Zoom meeting for all Library staff, featuring 91 people. That was hugely successful and lovely to see people’s faces. I felt a little emotional afterwards -I’d not realised how much I’d missed some people, particularly as I’ve been having regular virtual chats with my immediate team from the start of lockdown. I have enjoyed the WhatsApp chats with friends. It’s just been one -to-one chats or three of us, but it’s been nice. Small groups mean we can all speak and a few drinks is lovely. I quite enjoyed not having to go out or tidy up to see my friends, and sat in bed drinking wine at one of them! I’m also a member of a Year 6 WhatsApp mums group, which has been great. Everybody is really helpful and supportive, and it was lovely how many of them helped us out when we were self isolating at the start of lockdown -buying shopping for us and checking we were OK. Conversely, I’ve had to mute the Year 3 mums Messenger group because I got so angry with the staggering levels of selfishness from some of the members. They really didn’t see a problem with travelling 50 miles to the Lake District for a walk, going to the hairdresser and sitting next to friends in the park, shortly before the start of lockdown, despite government warnings not to, and the widespread information about Covid-19. At this point I was ill in bed, but they weren’t interested, because it’d affect their own mental health. Some of the other members have contacted me separately, and that’s been much nicer. They’re all getting frustrating with AC and AM on there, as teachers who seem to think they’re more hard done by with the lockdown than anybody else, and constantly ask stupid fussing questions about different things. It’s exhausting! Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have accounts for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but throughout the pandemic I’ve had to step away from Facebook in the same way as I’ve stepped away from the Year 3 Messenger group, because I felt I was getting too angry with friends irresponsibly travelling and spending time with people beyond their household. I’ve been using Twitter a lot, and whilst sometimes people have been winding me up with their selfishness and ignorance, the anonymity of the platform makes it easier for me to dismiss poor behaviour. I predominantly use Twitter to keep up to date rather than as an escape, as it feels like the news is more honest than we’re seeing in the mainstream UK media, plus it’s useful for see what’s happening elsewhere in the world, which again isn’t generally being covered on TV and the newspapers. D has been using Instagram quite a bit to post videos of his ukulele playing, which has been a major escape for him. They’re good! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Grocery shopping has been an unpleasant experience, although after the first anxiety-ridden trip to Tesco, it’s felt easier. I wear a face mask, although what use that is, I don’t really know, but I feel like it reduces the chances of me catching anything. The number of people, going the wrong way up one-way aisles then losing their temper when people point this out to them, as if they’re something special, is staggering. Similarly, navigating the fruit and veg aisles is horrid! Too many people getting close and leaning over you. When I step into an aisle empty of other customers, it’s an almost joyous experience! Other people are stressful! D and I had a discussion about which of us should go shopping and decided it’d be me, as overweight men, of which D is one, have higher mortality rates than women, so I go. At the start of the lockdown, D went to Lidl, where we used to shop pre-Covid, but came back so shaken up, we agreed not to return -too many people getting close, no social distancing measures in places and people getting angry when he asked them to step away. Friends had said that Tesco were far better organised, and indeed whilst it’s not an enjoyable experience, staff have been fantastic and the social distancing measures of one-way aisles and 2m gap markings on the floor are a massive help, also they sanitise the trollies and baskets before you take them. Online shopping hasn’t really happened, as we’ve usually not been able to get slots, although we have had a few small Amazon Prime grocery orders delivered, but their stock selection isn’t so broad as at Tesco. We have ordered beer from a local brewery a couple of times, and a local bar had been doing drinks deliveries (D’s leant the owner a bike for her rounds!), but these are relatively expensive, so we’ve not done that too often. One place which has been a revelation is a restaurant wholesaler, who obviously can’t currently deliver to restaurants, so has been delivering to people’s homes. I casually asked some friends if they wanted anything, so we could meet the minimum £50 delivery, and everybody said yes. We ended up as a bit of an impromptu grocery on delivery day, with friends arriving to collect sacks of bread flour and tubs of n’duja -so goodness knows what the neighbours thought, but it was lovely to see so many lovely friendly faces! D is a keen bread baker and has been for about 18 months before the current craze, so was thrilled to obtain so much flour. Getting hold of the sacks of flour felt like a weight had been lifted, because it had been so hard to get flour, alongside pasta and loo roll. We also managed to get a box of 16 packets of penne from the wholesaler, so worst case we have plain pasta and bread to eat! Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Our eating and cooking habits haven’t changed significantly, but not being able to nip into the shop on my way home from work is a nuisance, as we’ve usually forgotten something from the weekly shop. Neither of us are as keen to cook as we have been, especially D. We’re still eating a light lunch and a proper cooked meal in the evening, but none of it has been particularly inspiring. I think if we planned meals in advance a bit more, it’d be easier, but I’ve been so tired after working, and D after the home schooling, we can’t be bothered to think about food. We definitely been eating and drinking more than we do usually though, which isn’t great, and it’s very much comfort eating, because we’re fed up. Most evening we’re drinking a beer or a couple of glasses of wine, and stuffing crisps and chocolate in front of the telly, much more than we used to and consequently have both put on a bit of weight. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We’ve simply not had time to do anything new really. After I’ve finished work, I just want to sit and do very little. So, I continue with my thus far, 20 year family tree research project, read or do crosswords or jigsaws. D has been playing his ukulele and recording videos for Instagram. My exercise has decreased, as I simply can’t get motivated to do classes or go out for a run or bike ride. I’m missing the gym a lot. There’s quite a bit of DIY we could do, and we did re-felt the shed roof, the first weekend of lockdown, but our plans to repaint the kitchen haven’t come to fruition, although I may pop to B and Q next week and pick up some paint. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I’ve been trying to engage with pretty light weight books and comedies in the main, but some of the TV we’ve watched includes: The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer, Taskmaster, Unorthodox (Netflix), Normal People, Schitt’s Creek final series, Hollywood. Listening has been the Gossipmongers podcast and other usually history-based podcasts which pique my interest ­everybody and his dog seems to be producing podcasts ATM though, and some are of questionable quality or interest, and a welcome constant in the background is BBC 6 Music. I’ve been described as a veracious reader, but I have struggled to focus upon reading during lockdown; my mind wandering. However, I have read a couple of novels by Benjamin Myers (The Offing, Beastings and the Gallows Pole); The Wych Tree / Tana French; Common People: an anthology of working class writers; The Five / Hallie Rubehold; Girl, Woman, Other / Bernadine Evaristo; Big Sky / Kate Atkinson; The Woman in the White Kimono / Ana Johns. I’m currently reading Seaside 100 by Kathryn Ferry, which I’ve been keen to read for several months, and which the shortage of books meant it’s taken six weeks to get a copy. However, I’m thrilled it’s arrived, I’m loving it and I’m feeling homesick for the seaside (even though I don’t come from the seaside!) and the Garden of Lost and Found by Harriet Evans, which is OK, but is dragging on a bit. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? There have been no personal hygiene changes. I’ve not been able to go to the hairdresser, but maybe because of the reduction in pollution, my hair is far healthier than it’s been for a very long time. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Both myself and D suffered some insomnia at the beginning of the lockdown, but we both often did so before this anyhow. As time has gone on, we’ve both slept more heavily and for longer than when we needed to travel to work. I’ve not had any particularly interesting dreams, but I have noticed they’re in far more garish colours than normal. It’s also unusual for me to dream about people and places in my current life -I’d dream a lot about old places of employment, ex-colleagues or friends from primary school. Now however, I dream a lot about work colleagues in glorious technicolor. Sadly unless you count conversations about photocopying with History academics as interesting, then there’s nothing juicy in there (there were a few nice -brightly coloured -cakes last night though)."

I have found the lock down period fine as I understand that this is something that has to be done. I am lucky as I don’t mind my own company and living on my own I can always find plenty of things to do and have done so. In addition, I am also lucky that as an Admin Assistant in a  local village school I have been able to work from home. Also, I think we are lucky with the amount of technology available. If this had happened 20 years ago I think it would have been very different. The Government On a whole I think the government have acted pretty ok. In hindsight there are probably some things that could have been done differently.  For example, I think lockdown should have been a lot earlier.  However, all in all any government would have been in the same position and hindsight is a wonderful thing! I don’t understand why the government have been blamed for all the errors. PPE was never Matt Hancock’s responsibility and should have been ordered by the individual National Health Trust back in January.  They knew this virus was on its way so why didn’t they order this? The same can be said for care homes. Most care homes are privately owned with eye watering fees. Why did they not take more responsibility for PPE. News I download a digital version of the Daily Mail every day and I have been watching the daily Coronavirus briefings from Downing Street. I think the media have acted very badly during this crisis. Some of the questions they ask are down right stupid and they know it. The BBC in particular have not been partial during this time and I think the government should act on this when this is all over.  In fact, if the government decide to change the non payment of the license fee as a non criminal act I am seriously thinking of stopping my direct debit for the license fee. Work & Home Life I have been working from home during this crisis. However, I miss my grandchildren as they  used to stay over on a regular basis. I have a son and a daughter and both of them have been visiting albeit talking to each other from the window.  I live in a bungalow with a nice garden so this has been easy for me particularly with the nice weather we had. As lockdown has been easing I am able to visit my children and grandchildren and spend time with them in their gardens. Also, they come over to me and spend time in my garden. I have family on my late husband’s side who live in the North West.  I am very close to them and miss not being able to visit them and spend time with them. However, we have all been keeping in touch via Zoom quiz nights. Technology I am lucky that I embrace technology and also have grandchildren who tell me what I have to do if i get stuck. I have always used social media like Face Book and Twitter but very rarely post anything on them.  I do use Whats App and have  videoed friends using this. Also, I discovered Zoom which I had never heard of. In addition, I take part in Zumba classes via Zoom. Shopping and food I have been lucky that I registered for online shopping with Sainsbury a few years ago. They must have had details of my age as they very quickly identified me as a vunerable person due to my age and I have been able to have all my food delivered weekly. My eating habits have changed. I don’t buy ready meals anymore but tend to cook from scratch now.  However, I have eaten more than I should and have now put on weight which I will have to deal with soon. My drinking habits have also changed. I find myself pouring a glass of wine each evening at 5pm whilst watching the daily briefings from Downing Street. Entertainment and Leisure Since lockdown I have managed to decorate my house and also paint my shed and fences. However, getting the paint was a challenge and took weeks to arrive.   I managed to buy plants online from a local garden centre who delivered these to me. I would have liked to go to a garden centre but at the beginning of lockdown this wasn’t an option. Since garden centres have opened I have visited them. I have Netflix and Sky so have been streaming films etc. Personal hygiene I have not changed my personal hygiene during this period. I have always showered and washed my hair each day and I always put my makeup on everyday. I have tried to keep to a normal routine each day. Sleep I tend to suffer from insomnia but sometimes I do get a good nights sleep.  I did experience nightmares at the beginning of lockdown. Once, I dreamt that most of the people in the world had died due to coronavirus and I decided as I had lost all my family and friends life wasn’t worth living. So I climbed up on a roof to end it all. Just before I was going to jump my son, daughter and all my grandchildren were running toward me telling me not to jump. At that point I woke up but the dream has haunted me ever since."

Retired University Professor Health On 8th May I ate a large organic steak and 2 hours later had a raging temperature, shaking convulsively for half an hour at least, chewed 2 paracetamol tablets out of the tinfoil, and eventually it improved. The temperature (the only symptom apart from a dull pain in the stomach) went down but I was left exhausted for 10 days. I fear it may be my appendix again (I had appendicitis at Christmas, treated by antibiotics) though the fatigue suggested the virus and I stayed home in quarantine for 10 days. My mental health is fine, the odd gloomy moment and I miss the kids, grandkids and my 93 year old Mum, all 12 hours drive away in Scotland and therefore inaccessible, as the Scottish rules forbid me to travel. At the moment I find it difficult to entertain hope, lest I be cast down and disappointed. Government They sent me letters telling me to stay home weeks after we had all been told all this on TV, and the poor postman had to deliver them. Then I got repeats the following week. I was not over 70 or suffering from an underlying condition. This was typical of the bumbling approach to the epidemic in England. The Scots and Irish did much better (women leaders did better e.g. Germany and New Zealand) and spent less time politicking and blaming others. Any fool could see the statistics did not stack up and they turned out to have ignored lots of deaths in Care homes. In any case our death certificates tend to list the heart attack and pneumonia first and the third cause – Covid-is not counted statistically. Everything seemed to revolve around London and the economy, presumably because they are being pressured by cronies and funders. The scientific advisors emerged with much more credit, and I think people now see what universities are for. The “furlough” scheme is sensible (my son is a chef on furlough) though it is calculated on a vague average, and of course a chef in Scotland makes no money at all in October –March. I am also worried about the closeness of the govt. to Trump, and the latter’s warmongering against China as an election ploy. I assume they will take the costs of all this out of my pension via tax. News I read the Guardian every day and the Observer on Sunday, the John O Groat Journal news (and deaths) and watch the BBC lunchtime news (plus their headlines online). I don’t watch the govt. briefings on TV at 5.00 Too much jingoism and nationalism, and very English­focussed. While I can see people need feel-good stories and grounds for hope, all those heart­warming stories of people shaving off their hair for the NHS and running virtual marathons, left me cold. The govt. should pay NHS workers decent salaries rather than relying on individuals and charity. Much of the news is also irritating-i.e. being told that old people may resist IPhone apps. (Who is buying them these IPhones? They are not cheap.) Lives could have been saved if more of the media had been engaged with Asian or other minorities e.g. broadcasts in Punjabi, Urdu. Sign language is good but if the govt. organised the repair of hearing aids (none, now, for 8 weeks) it would reconnect a lot of older people. Work and home life I have been retired for 5 years now and had just corrected final proofs (four sets at breakneck pace) of a 200,000 word book, and even organised the cover photos, all in the week before lockdown. In theory we are just waiting to be able to press the print button-but libraries and universities are shut right now and not much paper printing occurring. Otherwise I have corrected proofs of 2 scholarly essays, for a British book and an American journal, and at the moment have no commitments or deadlines (which I do not much like!) I lack a sense of real purpose at the moment. I have done some reading for a potential essay but inspiration did not strike and I am also being careful not to sit for too long at the computer (back and knee problems).I decided not to prepare for my usual intellectual history seminar since it may not happen and I could not get hold of the necessary materials (library shut). I live alone and the main challenge has been the sudden cessation of my University of the Third Age groups – Books, Spanish, Gardening and French, plus the closure of the pool I swim in, and the cancellation of my fortnightly classical concerts. I celebrated my 70th birthday on my own, though with lots of cards and presents and phone chats, and even blew out candles with a friend with a similar birthdate , online. I have a daily routine of paper, crossword, shower, phone Mum at 11.40, news at 1.00 with lunch, Codeword puzzle after lunch, and dinner at 6.45-with TV after that. I find it helps to have some structure in the day. I also usually take an hour’s walk – though not if under the weather or if it is very hot. The French chat for an hour on Wednesday, Skyping with a friend on Tuesday and Zooming with friends on alternate Thursdays is also a kind of structure. Technology My life has been much improved by the use of Facetime (kids), Skype (friends) and Zoom (friends and my French conversation class. ) It makes a huge difference to be able to see the grandkids and them see me – the phone does not work well for small children (aged 3 and 1).And we can show each other things-their tadpoles, my roses, their newly painted bathroom, their pets and the snow falling outside their house. It lifts my heart. I phone my sister in law and stepson most weeks, or they phone me, Skype a friend in France (we have known each other for 60 years) and another in Scotland who is a University Professor with whom I have a hilarious chat about professional things every week. She is much younger (an ex-student) so keeps me on my toes.) This level of connection is more than usual-in the latter case because she is stuck in one place rather than being perpetually on research trips. I also Zoom with my old university flatmates every 2 weeks and that has worked really well-they both have children who are doctors so they often have sombre news, one lives alone, the other is locked down with a diabetic husband, so these chats have been important to us all. We used to phone or email but the Zoom chats allow us to fix a reliable date and time and look forward to it. I also Zoom with 12 fellow U3A French conversationalists, using Dropbox to circulate documents, reading short plays and discussing topical issues, doing quizzes in French etc. We are all fluent, And the 2 younger men understand technology. The 86 year old is also good-he had to master technology to operate his Wifi hearing aid. My working friend however is fed up with endless screen meetings where as she says all your identities are in one place and you have never spent so much time looking at your own face. She has taken to knitting dog rescue blankets below the level of the group sightlines. The head of her University now knows that she has a clock which sounds a different birdsong every hour. I realise I need to buy an IPhone as my IPad won’t handle many apps but am hesitating to do so until I can do it in a shop where they will set everything up for me. I don’t use social media which seem to be full of boasters and denigrators. I prefer personal communication. Shopping and Food I’ve been shopping at the small village Coop (a bit expensive). I don’t relish large supermarkets now and the Coop gives money to the local community. At first it was difficult to get eggs, milk and Allinson’s bread and it was 3 weeks before I managed to buy loo roll. I was well-stocked up (as usual, if you live alone you have to have enough stocks to weather a bout of flu). Even now we are limited to 2 milk cartons, 2 meats etc. I had frozen 4 pints of milk some time ago and also still have some long-life milk, so was Ok. I only shop once a week, usually when it is half empty. People are not good at self-distancing and old people keep picking things up and putting them back. Otherwise I have paid my paper bill by post and phone, and got vitamins, books and printers ink, as usual, by post. My cleaner came back this week, masked and gloved and spraying anti-virus stuff before and behind her (and on all the carpets, soft furnishings and so on.) I felt slightly nervous but it is a relief to have a clean house -I cannot get my Hoover upstairs now. ( She would do my shopping if necessary.) I am also eating my own herbs and leaf salads, and frozen fruit and veg from my garden, and soon will be eating fresh berries again. My diet has not really suffered though it is a bit less varied. On the plus side I can eat lots more garlic since I am never near anyone. And more time means I eat a really good salad lunch. Todaywithlettuce from myfriend M ’s allotment. Entertainment and leisure I increased my exercise (a walk) to cover the absence of swimming, otherwise I am doing the usual amount of gardening (a lot) reading (ditto) and family tree research. I am also keeping a Virus diary initially for U3A but it is now becoming one for the grandkids, I think. I am a keen gardener and am currently growing broad beans and peas, beetroot, radishes, sorrel, salads and herbs, and have potted out tomatoes, cucumbers and climbing French beans. My cinnamon basil and Blackeyed Susie were also grown from seed along with lots of African marigolds. I have done a lot of watering, especially 2 new roses. But the dry weather has done for sunflowers and nasturtiums-or perhaps the squirrel ate the seed. I have netted my berries but could not net all the cherries or plums and the pigeons are causing a lot of damage I always read 4 or5 novels a week and this has not changed, though I have also read some nonfiction (3 books on Shakespeare’s biography, 2 on Jane Austen’s sister, one on the history of the fens). I’ve recentlyread worksbyLucyFoley, Adrian McKinty, Simenon (at least 2 a week in French), Arnold Bennett, R C Sheriff, Damon Galgut, Dalia Sofer, Lily King, Curtis Sittenfeld, Hilary Mantel, Ann Pratchett, Anne Tyler, Mischa Berlinski, Sebastian Barry and Olga Tokarczuk. Many are just published and as I have some eye problems I mostly buy kindle which is not affected by printing delays. A friend also organised a poetry exchange though many of the poems were turgid. The main plus was reconnecting with 2 friends I had not seen in 45 years, one now a millionaire in Australia, the other teaching in Belfast. I’ve been watching a few hours of TVmost evenings, especially detective/crime, costume drama. French films, gardening, history and art programmes. And anything archaeological. Not so much music despite how much I miss my concerts. I prefer it live and at home am likely to get distracted from it by other things. I listen to classical music all day anyway while cooking or cleaning. I have not yet seen the birthday DVD of the new Tarantino (saving it for a rainy day). I thought I’d organise all my photos and bought several large albums but the weather has been so good I have been outside in the garden a lot. And trips down memory lane can be a bit gloomy. Personal Hygiene I have a shower every day now as I no longer go swimming. I would love to get my hair cut, it looks unkempt. But I don’t reallypay much attention to myappearance. And we all look awful on the computer screen anyway. I pressed the “Touchup my appearance” button but my friend H immediately said-“are you OKyou look horriblyflushed” -so that didn’t work. I’d really like to see the dentalhygienist, though, and am flossing like mad in terror of anything going wrong while there are no dentists. (Madness.) Sleep I had one or two nightmares (Luggage left behind in a foreign place, a recurrent dream, which may mean I have left unfinished business behind me. Sometimes it is nice to rediscover all the stuff, sometimes it is not and I get lost in a strange place with heavy bags.) And one where my house was falling apart (I have not been able to repaint the rain damaged ceiling.) Exhaustion meant plenty of sleep usually."

Of course I have had my off days, and certainly in the first couple of weeks, I couldn’t get through 24 hours without tears overtaking me -sorrow for people that we knew who I feared might not survive, for our lifestyle, our friends, our community, our church, and of course for our country. So much unknown, and so much fear. We had locked down a few days before it was officially the requirement, be­cause we are both over 70, and that was the advice at the time -don’t wait to be told; just do it, so on Monday and Tuesday 16 & 17 March 2020 we walked into town together ( unusual to go together, but there was a sense of something a little momentous ) and bought all sorts of odd things we thought we would need, including toiletries and make up to last 3 months. Why on earth did I think I would be bothering with make up?? We also arranged to have The Observer delivered every Sunday, and the local paper which comes out on Saturdays would be delivered with it, and I set up internet banking so I would be able to pay my credit cards bills even if we could not go out. We have always had a milkman and I booked us into an organic veg­etable bag delivery service. A bit more expensive, but I have been fortunate not to have to worry about a few extravagances during lockdown -no gym fees, no hair cuts every 4 weeks to offset them against. I always keep a good store cupboard, and we still have the Brexit Bunker to fall back on, so when we locked down, we felt we had done all we could to prepare ourselves for what might lie ahead. I do think that helped with my well-being, having that reassurance that we had made positive preparations, chosen to lock down before we were or­dered to do so, and felt we would be able to cope. It also helps that we have a large enough house that we are not under each others feet all the time -we have been married for nearly 51 years, but we have lots of separate interests and we were not used to living in each other’s pockets. I should say we used to have lots of separate interests, because life has closed down, closed in on us and we are at home together far more than we have ever been. The Government You ask for my thoughts on the political decisions that have been taken ­where shall I begin? To set the record straight, I am a passionate Remainer, (now we call, our­selves Rejoiners) and have been on several of the big protest marches in London. I didn’t vote Conservative, I am a Libdem, but in the December 2019 GE I lent my vote to the Labour candidate who, it seemed at the time, stood more chance of getting into this very Tory constituency than the LibDems. Much good that did us, as despite serious splits in the local conservative party after our MP Rory Stewart was thrown out of the Party. The candidate dropped into the constituency by Tory Party HQ, known to no-one, never been an MP before, was elected. The Government’s decisions on CV-19 have been wrong from the very begin­ning. Johnson is too much influenced by Trump, in style and in politics. This country and others had weeks of warnings from events in China and then in Italy, but precious time was lost, and even when the inevitable was upon us, there was no organisation, no strategy. My journal for 3 March records ’ 51 cases in UK now and we know this shit shambles of a govt has no real plans to cope, no mental capacity to organise a coping strategy.’ ( Sorry about the language -that has been one very notable effect of Brexit and CV19 for me!) One of the many problems with this govt* is that cabinet posts were given to Brexiteers, who were loyal to the ideology, and usually far from competent to hold such posts. Decisions have always been Brexit first, anything else sec­ond or third, and that includes coping with CV-19. No clear messaging, de­spite Johnson’s penchant for 3 word slogans. So we had ‘Stay at home, don’t go to work’, swiftly followed literally in his next breath by ‘ Go to work if you have to’. This confusion has been repeated time after time -‘Wear a face mask.’ ‘Don’t wear a face mask’, then ’Face masks will be compulsory in shops ‘ until Gove was seen coming out of Pret a Manger or similar with food but not wearing a mask, and then it was ’Face masks will be compulsory in shops, but not in takeaways ‘. Then ‘You don’t have to wear a face mask if it makes you feel uncomfortable’ . In other words -do what you want. And of course, that is just what Dominic Cummings did, and got away with it. What sort of message is that for the general public? No wonder young peo­ple are holding illegal raves and parties. I don’t approve of them but under­stand their frustrations. With regard to easing the lockdown, it really has been Wealth before Health ­‘Get businesses back to work’, and then this last week ‘Go back to work ‘ sub text being ‘Save the coffee shops and takeaways from going under’. And then there are the lies -lie after lie -often about PPE -supplies, orders, deliveries -any aspect of PPE has had several versions, and even now, we don’t know that we have been told the truth. Lies about statistics, lies about scientific advice, lies about where Johnson was and what he was doing. I no longer trust anything this regime says. If they told me it was raining, I would look out of the window to check. This is not a good situation to be in. And the public money wasted, with contracts awarded, without going to ten­der ( which is allowed under their emergency powers legislation) to inappro­priate companies, whose owners happen to be friends and relatives of minis­ters, MPs and Tory donors. The level of corruption is terrifying in the ease and blatant complacency with which it has been done. The emergency pow­ers assume that relevant companies will be awarded contracts, not one for PPE to a confectionery manufacturer. Govt steps in future months -more of the same I fear. They will urge the public to return to what used to be normal, some will; others like me will re­main cautious. When the second wave of CV19 hits, as I fear it will, it will be everyone and anyone else’s fault, not the govt’s. You will have gathered that I am so very angry about this dysfunctional incompetent govt. * govt -I think so little of them they are not worthy of the full word, and in fact I often refer to them as the Regime, because that is what they are, not a government at all. News We gave up watching any news coverage on BBC some time ago, finding them more a govt mouthpiece than an impartial news service. We watch an occasional BBC LookNorth in NE and Cumbria. Our main source of News is Channel 4 at 7pm, which we find is more in depth and its reporters do chal­lenge incorrect statements from govt ministers. This is probably why the govt has not allowed any ministers to be interviewed on Ch4 news for weeks, but they are shooting themselves in the foot because Ch4 always announce that they asked for a govt spokesperson but none was ‘available’. Ch4 always adds how long it is since anyone was ‘available’, thus making the govt look afraid or guilty, or both. Otherwise, it is the Observer on Sundays for both of us, the Guardian on-line and The New European for me, emails from Inews and other organisations, and also, Twitter. Daughter in Law was horrified when I said this, but I am careful with the provenance and who I follow. I first learned about the corrup­tion involving the Referendum and Cambridge Analylitica from Twitter. Because our opinion of the govt was already so poor we made a conscious decision NOT to watch any of the 5pm briefings during the height of the pan­demic in UK. From what we have heard, seen and read since, we have missed some dire performances by Matt Hancock, and Johnson and the hu­miliation of our national senior nurse, and assorted scientific advisers. We get the gist of the briefing later from Guardian on-line or Ch4 news. No problems with access to the news -but we do sympathise with those who needed sign language . Since this Directive was issued, sign language inter­preters have been present at the briefings ( and the briefings themselves have now finished). It is, however, a sad indictment of the contempt this govt has for people, that it had not occurred to them that sign language was nec­essary. There is a similar issue with the wearing of face masks, in that they prevent people with a hearing loss from lip reading. I don’t have the answer to this -but the question itself did not even register with the govt. Again -uncar­ing and contemptuous of the people whose well being is the govt’s responsi­bility. Work and Home Life We are both retired and so have not been working from home. However, pre­lockdown we led busy and fulfilling lives which have just gone on hold, but we are beginning to wonder if we really want to return to the voluntary activities in which we were so involved. Husband was a member of the Town Council. He is a bit of a technophobe and the problems of accessing Microsoft Team for meetings and the council’s own email system on our iMac were very stressful and far from satisfactory. In fact, we have had two periods of several weeks without access to our iMac, for unknown reasons -but we suspected the problem was caused by the installation of two Microsoft programmes for Husband’s Town Council work. Our new best friend for a long time was a senior Apple adviser based in Portugal. We managed personal emails and internet access with my iPad mini, but no means of writing replies to this MO directive (hence long time taken to reply) and nothing for Husband’s Town Council work. Just last week he decided enough was enough -there were other factors involved -and he resigned as a local councillor. A great shame in may ways, as he had a lot to offer. A tribute from the Deputy Mayor in our local paper last Saturday in­cluded .. ‘He mixes friendliness, kindness, diligence and attention to detail and I hope his example of reasoned and respectful debate will be long remembered in these halls. ‘ A wonderful and well-deserved comment. We are both members of our local methodist church and were regular attend­ers. We had both held various voluntary posts within the church, and alt­hough Husband had stood down from his, I was still on the wider leadership team, with various responsibilities, and I often went down to do things in the building during the week. All that ended with lockdown, and at first, that was one of my sadnesses. I made a list of people I intended to phone regularly ­not all from church, but a lot were. I even turned it into a sort spread sheet so I could keep a record of when I had phoned each person, but I soon found that without seeing the church friends every week, and having no church things to discuss, I had very little to say to them. To be fair, this was also the case with other friends -after you’ve asked ‘How are you?’ when no-one is going anywhere or seeing anyone, what else do you say? We have been participating in a live streamed service on YouTube from Cen­tral Methodist Hall in Westminster most Sundays and in a shorter service also YouTube from an anglican church in the West Midlands which our son and his family attend. The biggest draw at first was occasionally seeing him on screen when he had been recorded taking part in the service, but we have come to enjoy that short simple service every much. I shall not be in a hurry to return to services at our local church when they are eventually resumed. ( Probably mid August, and very short meditational services, no singing, no coffee and chat afterwards. Our Superintendent Minister reminds us that over 70s are still advised not to attend, but it is our own decision. ) As I have indicated previously, we are not used to being in each other’s com­pany all day and all evening, but we do have a large enough house in which to get away from each other…….. and then there is the garden -quite large, and challenging, as much of it is a steep bank, a herbaceous border with shrubs and large-ish stones, about 45 feet across and 10 steep feet deep. Then there are two side borders, another bed in front of the sitting room french doors and a small veg and soft fruit patch. That’s all behind the house. The front garden is also sloping ( we do live in hilly Cumbria after all) and is covered with gravel, planted with shrubs and lavender mostly inherited from the previous owners . I have never liked gardening in the front garden, neither here, nor at our previous house, so this is pretty much left to itself apart from necessary weeding, occasional pruning and the annual lavender cutting back after flowering. I am the gardener and spend many hours work­ing away. It sometimes seems an endless battle against the weeds, brought in by the wind and the birds but it is also my Happy Place, and I would rather garden than do housework. Husband mows the lawn, in which he takes great pride, raking first to remove the thatch, then mowing. He even goes round the edges on his hands and knees with little hand clippers. So during this lockdown, it has been easy to keep some spaces for ourselves. How we will get on if lockdown continues into the autumn and winter remains to be seen! I would like to mention Son here. His wife had what was first described as mild case of CV19, which was then ‘upgraded ‘ to a medium case. She is, in fact, one of the many who are what is known as long tail recoverers. She was ill in mid-March, and is still far from well, with severe chest pains & total lack of energy among her continuing symptoms. At the beginning, the whole fam­ily had to isolate, but Son continued to work from home until he was fur­loughed. For over 4 months he has been caring for his wife, and their chil­dren, including home schooling, running the house, shopping, cooking, laun­dry -everything, and all the while very anxious abut his wife’s health. We think he has been exceptional and used Father’s Day as an opportunity to send him a card telling him so. For us, the frustration has been being unable to help, except by sending treats and surprises via on-line shopping. Technology see also comments above in Work and Home Life. I am the more techy of the two of us ( which is not claiming much!) and make great use of my iPad mini for emails, Twitter and to a lesser extent Facebook. I am also responsible for our church’s social media, so run their Twitter and Facebook accounts as well as my own. What a godsend the iPad mini has been. I took the decision to buy a new one just after lockdown began, using what would have been my Gym membership fees to offset the cost. I use it constantly -probably far too much, and try to limit my time especially on Twit­ter, where a couple of hours can pass without my noticing. We have Face-Timed with Son once or twice, but somehow it does not seem very successful -perhaps because his wife is too poorly ( see above) to par­ticipate fully. We use YouTube on our TV for the church services in which we participate, which is fine. I was asked to install WhatsApp on my phone to facilitate church affairs -but so far all all I have used it for was for chatting with a friend, in a rather artifi­cial atmosphere -a little like our experience with FaceTime, I now realise. Zoom is also fine -for my exercise class and I will be interested to see how I get on in a couple of weeks with a Zoom Church Council meeting. Our church has been holding Zoom coffee mornings but we have not bothered to join in. Shopping and Food Oh what a palaver it was trying to get online groceries! I was so annoyed with Sainsbury’s where I have been a loyal and regular shopper for many years, at our previous house and then when they opened a store here. When I tried to register for online shopping, there was no way of indicating that I was a regular shopper nor that I was over 70, the age group that the govt was recommending to stay at home. They were obviously overwhelmed by the de­mand. I could not even register for Sainsbury’s online shopping let alone get a delivery slot. In desperation, I turned to Tesco -not a store I like and as the nearest branch is about 20 miles away, the carbon footprint of deliveries is horrendous -Sainsbury’s is walking distance form home. Tesco welcomed me with open arms -but having registered, got my club card number etc, there were no delivery slots for the foreseeable future, so that was a complete waste of time. Nothing for it -we had to do our own shopping, with careful precautions. There’s an M&S Food just down the road -our corner shop! I went to their oldies’ hour once every two or three weeks. With milk being delivered daily , and our weekly organic vegetable bag, a breadmaker and just about enough flour and yeast to keep going and a good store cupboard, we managed very well. I come from a not very well off family and was brought up to keep a good store cupboard and to be able make a meal out of whatever you have. This has stood me in good stead throughout my life. The delivered weekly vegetable bag has thrown up a few challenges, and my starting point for our meals is ‘What do we have in the veg bag?’ I have aways enjoyed vegetarian meals -Husband less so, but he’s getting more used to them, partly through the veg bag and partly through concern for the environment, but we both still enjoy a good steak! I was surprised how many veggie cookery books I had accumulated, and what a lot you can do with a bag of chard. Since lockdown has eased, I have ventured out a little more and now go to our Booths supermarket ( northern equivalent of Waitrose) as well as M&S Food. The small local shops in town are open with precautions, so I go to the deli and the health food shop for other items, but I still try to go only every other week, and have been wearing my face mask, despite some stares from other shoppers. Now everyone will have to wear masks in shops so I won’t stand out as an odd bod. We have definitely drunk more alcohol during lockdown -a glass or two or three of wine with dinner most evenings. Husband beings to a wine club so there is always a good selection waiting to be drunk. We did drink quite a lot anyway ( yes, I know -we’re methodists, but lots of Ministers will have a drink these days. I recall leaving a very sticky Church meeting a few years ago and saying sympathetically to the minister that I was having a large cup of tea when I got home, to which he replied that I was welcome to it, but he was go­ing to have a large whisky! ) Entertainment and Leisure A recent addition to my week is an exercise class twice a week via Zoom. This has made a huge difference to me -some structure to my flabby week and some assistance to my equally flabby body. Pre lockdown I was exercis­ing three times a week in an early morning class -7.40 a.m and this Zoom class is the same teacher and a lot of my old classmates, not that we can see much of each other on a Zoom screen, especially on an iPad mini! This is not necessarily a bad thing. I am also enjoying doing a little bit Circle dancing -of one of my main pleas­ures. It is sort of international folk dances, but some are traditional and some have modern choreography -for example, we have recently danced to “When I’m 64’ ‘Let’s get together and feel all right’ and very recently to ‘Que sera sera’ and ‘We’ll meet again’. -a bit too sentimental for me, but you just go with the flow. In our current set up, we are 5 from our regular class plus teacher, so keep­ing to the limit of maximum of 6 persons from different households. The other class members were invited and we offered to rotate weekly, so that all could have a turn, but no-one else wanted to do it. Which is interesting -why not? FOGO-Fear Of Going Out ? We dance usually once a week in the open air, on a nearby village green, which is large enough for us to be away from the main users and not be a disturbance to them, although we have been favourably commented on in so­cial media as an added attraction to the green. There is also a very good cof­fee van, whose owner is known to us. And now so are his Cumberland sau­sage baps and bacon butties. We should have been there this morning, but the rain deterred us and we hoped to go this afternoon,(23/7/2020) but it’s still raining and the grass would be very wet, and not conducive to dancing. So I am determined to use this time to finish off this directive, even though I have spent most of the morning on Twitter exploring the depths of the Russia Re­port and corruption in the govt. Another of my hobbies is Scrapbooking -this is not sticking old birthday cards onto sugar paper pages, but an American concept of arranging your photo­graphs in a more meaningful and attractive way. I am years and years be­hind, especially with the individual books I am making for each of our 4 grandchildren. Last year, I went with a friend to new York and Chicago -we are both members of our local U3A, and both belong to the Art Appreciation and Architecture Groups, so the two of us went off with a packed itinerary of art gallery and special buildings. Lockdown has proved an ideal time to get sorting out the many photos from that 10-day trip and mint them in a special book. So far, I have nearly finished New York -Chicago still to tackle. it is time consuming and enjoyable, but again, our lack of access to our iMac held me up because I couldn’t print any photos for several weeks. Another scrapbooking project was for our bellringing tower. (More about bell ringing below) Luckily, I had brought home a rather random collection of pho­tos, newspaper cuttings etc a couple of weeks before lockdown, and bought a new album to mount them in. That has also taken some time and a bit of re­search as some items were undated, and did not always include names. This turned out to be interesting but it was a mixed blessing, because it reminded me of all the fun times we’d had on outings to ring at other places, meals at Christmas and New Year and any other opportunity, pushing to the back of my mind the occasions when I have come home and wept in frustration at my inability to pull a bell rope at exactly the right time and with exactly the right amount of effort, -and weakening my resolve to give it up. The scrap book was going to be my farewell gesture -more about this below. I often feel that I have wasted my lockdown time. I haven’t learned any new skills nor brushed up any old ones. As I mentioned previously, I am a church bell ringer, and usually ring at the parish church on a Sunday morning before trotting round the corner to our methodist church. I am NOT a good ringer, and have a love/hate relationship with the whole thing, but when we went into lockdown, I thought what a good opportunity to really learn a particular method I had been struggling with for ages. Methods are what we call the se­quences we ring. They are not tunes! Well, have I learned it? No, I have not. In fact, I have been re-assessing what I do with my life and deciding to give up several things, and bell ringing was one of them. So when it was decreed a couple of weeks ago that church bells could be rung again, in restricted cir­cumstance and for 15 minutes only, just before a service, and our Tower Captain emailed me to ask on which dates I would be available to ring, I told him I would not be ringing for the foreseeable future. I see now that I was al­ready hedging my bets, not coming straight out and admitting that I was going to hang up my rope. Last Sunday, I happened to be in the garden, and the time, the wind direction and the traffic noise were all in conjunction and I could just hear the great tenor bell being rung up, ready to start ringing, and I just thought -how can I give it up? Then a couple of chance emails from ringers ….and I now think I will return, if we are ever able to hold evening practices again. Meanwhile, I will get out my book of Methods and try to get my head round ringing Grandsire on bell number 3. I normally enjoy going to art galleries and live relays to our local cinema from National Theatre, RSC etc, but when such goodies have been on TV, I have not wanted to watch them, or be involved. This seems such a missed oppor­tunity, but I simply have not been interested. There is a similar reaction in my reading during lockdown. We are both great readers, Husband sits for hours and reads solidly -he is working his way through his collection of Josephine Tay novels at the moment -beautiful Folio society editions, which are one of his indulgences. He is also reading an A C Grayling massive tome on philosophy in between them. I am a disappoint­ment to myself with my reading in lockdown . My concentration has become very poor, and I am easily distracted -see comment on Twitter above. Would I have been like this if the pandemic had not been so badly managed in this country? Is my outrage the reason for my lack of concentrated read­ing? I do read The Observer and The New European every week pretty carefully, but my box of waiting-to-be-read books sits reproachfully on the landing, and is actually fuller now than it was at the beginning of lockdown, because I have still been buying books that seemed essential at the time, but less attractive now . Don’t get me wrong -I am still reading, but not as avidly as I used to. The books on feminist theology which I thought I would devour while I had no external distractions have not even been opened, but I’ve bought one or two more. The friendship between Wordsworth and Coleridge doesn’t seem that inter­esting any more. I'm about 1/3 of the way through The Friendship by Adam Sisman, and tell myself I’ll return to it eventually. I think I might skip a few chapters because it is really their lives in the Lake District that interest me ­but without reading most of the book, I won’t understand their close relation­ship which led to Wordsworth and Southey taking care of Coleridge’s family when he was off on a trip -in both senses of the word. Currently reading ‘1599: a year in Shakespeare’s Life’ by James Shapiro which is very good and I promise myself an hour with it when I have finished writing this. Other recent books read include Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty -not one I would have picked up, but recommended by Daughter, and very worth while. The author is a teenage autistic boy, pas­sionate and eloquent about nature. This book made me realise that we need people with autism to show us a different focus on the world -Greta Thun­berg, and Dara McAnulty. I think perhaps I was trying to trying to read books that are too ‘worthy’ and what I really need is escapist and comfort reading. I have really enjoyed a bit of a Kate Atkinson fest, with ‘Life after Life,’ and ‘A God in Ruins’. Her ‘Hu­man Croquet’ sits waiting but I am going to finish 1599 first, which I am en­joying very much. I have been gardening a lot, as I have already mentioned, and at the begin­ning of lockdown we were walking round the local lanes and field paths regu­larly. Hardly at all now, and it sometimes hard to say how the day has passed. That is one of the strange aspects of this lockdown-Time is so fluid. Note to self -look for a book on time/space continuum. Some days seem to be endless, and then suddenly, the week has passed and it is Friday again and the church bulletin is emailed to me and I post bits from it on the church Facebook page and print it out for Elderly Friend and one of us walks round to her house to deliver it and have a chat -no longer from the front garden through an open window -hurrah! We get up later -meals are later -usually watch a DVD in the evening. We have an extensive collection of DVDs as well as books and CDs. No wonder we need a big house for two of us, and have been watching whatever takes our fancy. Fairly early on in lockdown, we watched an old TV series which we have on DVD ‘Ever Decreasing Circles’ Richard Briers, Penelope Wilton and Peter Egan. That led to ‘What else was Peter Egan in?’ and we watched ‘A Perfect Spy’ which led onto the Alan Bennet play about Burgess ‘ An Englishman Abroad ‘ with Alan Bates as Burgess and Coral Browne playing herself. Then naturally we wanted to watch Alan Bennett ’s play about Anthony Blunt -the spy whose identity was kept secret because he was Keeper of the Queens’ Pictures. ‘A Question of Attribution’ is a beautiful piece writing from Alan Bennett, imagining a conversation between HM and Blunt. He was talking about one of her pictures which might be a fake -and we are left to surmise what HM was really referring to. Husband is very fond of Morse and Endeavour, and Inspector Frost -but I have seen them so often, that I don’t want to see them again for ages. My personal indulgence is Escape to the Chateau on Ch4 and its sequel Es­cape to the Chateau DIY. They are factual programmes, but highly edited, I am sure, -about how Dick and Angel Strawbridge are rescuing a derelict cha­teau and turning it into a successful business. He is an engineer and ex Lt Colonel and she is a very talented designer. I watched them all when first broadcast, but they are available on All4 and I am so enjoying watching them all again. I try to ration myself to one episode a day. I think the clue is in the first word of the title, and they are indeed my escape and relaxation. You cannot imagine my delight when somehow, without looking for it, I found on the internet some of Angel Strawbridge’s fabric designs. I didn’t even know you could buy them, so of course I ordered a metre which I will use somewhere, possibly in our revamped utility room -I must have watched too many episodes, because I announced to Husband that I thought we should knock down an internal wall in the utility room and re-arrange it. I even of­fered to knock the wall down myself if he got a big hammer -‘Yeah -with your arthritic hand?’ was his reply. How mean -but true. We are not DIYers. Husband has more or less given up an anything harder than changing a light-bulb, so we have had a man in from a local firm to take measurements and give us an estimate -it is bound to be a lot more than I expect. Our Personal Hygiene has not been affected at all by lockdown. We still shower/ hair wash in the way that we usually do. Sheets and towels changed every week. Husband decided this year that he could wear a shirt or t shirt for 2 days instead a clean one every day, unless strenuous activity had taken place ( unlikely) but I think that was before lockdown, because he does his own ironing. ( welcome to what was my world, dearest!) All I can say for myself is that I don’t wear any make up, and seem to be ro­tating the same few tops and jeans, especially now the weather here has turned quite chilly and I need a fleece over a long sleeve mid-season top. But everything is washed just as frequently as it always was. We are a bit per­nickety I suppose. Sleep Oh yes please! I have never been a very good sleeper. I can remember when I was a little girl aged between 5 and 8, not getting off to sleep and hearing one of my aunties talking about it to my dad downstairs. Was I per­haps staying awake to read the nursery rhymes on my bedroom wallpaper was her suggestion. No, there were no words, only pictures. Now, thinking back, I wonder if I was making up stories in my head about the pictures or re­citing the rhymes that I knew to myself? Possibly some insecurity from hav­ing lived with one of the aunties for 2 years after my mother died and only seeing my dad at weekends? Whichever, it is a pattern I have found difficult to bre"

Both retired, my previous occupation was as an academic in science education; husband was chemistry teacher. No children Written on 16 May We are staying pretty healthy. Husband has regular medication for hypertension and atrial fibrillation he had some years back. I take no medication – except occasional paracetamol for back pain. I had a bad back just before lockdown and went twice to the chiropractor – just a pity I can’t get any appointments now as my back continues to suffer somewhat. However, with doing Pilates 3 times a week – two of these as online Zoom classes – I’m am keeping any pain and irritation under control. Emotionally I have gone down and up – at the beginning of lockdown, I was pretty anxious – mainly about things like – would there be enough food; would the heating oil be delivered; would our friend who seemed to have Covid be alright. I like to be able to control things and any apparent lack of control can make be anxious (unlike my husband who doesn’t worry and thinks I’m worrying about nothing – he’s usually right and in these cases he was). So gradually fell into relaxed routine with lots of exercise, craft, reading etc. Whenever I go for a walk – most days – my mood lifts and I feel very happy. Recently I have got more frustrated and slightly angry because of the restrictions in not being able to do ‘normal’ things. However, generally we are managing well and feel very lucky in our situation – with a large garden, plenty of hobbies and home and space to do them in. Initially, I though the Government seemed to be handling the situation well – being very clear about what is expected and protecting the NHS. However, I (and particularly my husband) have become more cynical as time has gone on and more has been revealed about the underlying bureaucracy and government decision-making. (We both have left-wing tendencies.) For example – extracts from my diary: 22/4/20 ‘Immense criticism over lack of PPE in NHS & care settings, also testing still a problem.’ – this still continues now nearly a month on. 27/4/20 ‘PM back in no.10 – saying won’t sacrifice health of nation – we’ll see – hints of lockdown slowly lifting but real worries over care homes and lack of PPE generally.’ 1/5/20 ‘Jeremy Hunt was most hypocritical on Today programme this morning – claiming how good Health Secretary was in ramping up CV testing, and how important the social care sector is – SO WHY DID YOU DO NOTHING FOR THEM WHEN YOU WERE HEALTH SEC!’. 3/5/20 ‘Covid tracing app is to be trialled on Isle of Wight – we’re sceptical about it working.’ 10/5/20 PM changes guidance – this all now seems confusing. The latest news is about teaching unions being concerned about the scientific evidence behind government allowing schools to re-open, with specific measures being taken, possibly by 1 June. I tend to share the feeling, now more prevalent, that the Government is not handling the situation well – BUT the science is not clear so I can understand the mixed messages. BUT the Government seems to be an inner cabinet, acting for England alone, with little clear strategy. I suspect they are sticking to their right wing tendencies, and the hiatus with PM being out of action for a while with Covid hasn’t helped. The real test will be what happens in Brexit & US trade negotiations – it could be that next year, we will be in dire medical and financial straits through this Government’s handling of the situation. Though the Chancellor seems to come over as doing a reasonable job. It could be that Keir Starmer will really be a good opposition leader and hold Government to account – but not easy in the way Parliament currently runs via virtual means. Let’s just hope Parliament can bring some checks and balances to ensure it’s not a totalitarian right-wing management. I get most of my news from an hour of the BBC Radio Today programme in the morning; BBC News online a couple of times a day; ITV (or BBC) national and local evening news; occasional local papers in print or online. I have read quite a lot of the longer feeds on BBC news – in trying to compare the 1 Spring Directive Part 2 2020 Covid 19 R7467 situation in different countries. I watched the first few government briefings but have stopped doing that for the past three weeks or so – partly because it’s now just a political show to present Government in a good light and see how they manage difficult questions with a typical politician’s attitude. Having daily figures for cases and deaths can be misleading – do people understand that death figures are somewhat historical because they reflect the date of registration rather than the date of death? Because we are both retired, our home life has not been changed all that much. Yes, I’ve been frustrated at not going out to: pub quizzes with friends; my normal volunteering activities; shopping a lot; visiting local towns and pubs; walking in different places etc. But we have been able to keep very well occupied with hobbies, gardening, local walking and cooking. We’ve always been into using our laptops a lot – (that was one of my initial worries – what would happen if we lost internet connection/ hardware for any reason – how would we cope). So we have been doing a lot online. For example, watching theatre productions and lots of other interests on YouTube videos -in fact, via email and facebook I’ve seen so many suggestions that it’s impossible to watch them all (with the good weather it’s been great to be in the garden a lot anyway). One of the most uplifting clips early on was of the Corey band playing Chitty Chitty Bang Bang each from their own home. It has been fascinating to see how people have adjusted to operating in lockdown – for example ITV’s Isolation Stories (15 minute shorts) and Channel 4’s Grayson Perry’s art class have been really good. It is bringing out the creative in all of us. I continue to keep up with friends and family through Whatsapp, text, email and phone calls – just more frequently than before lockdown. Some local friends we happen to chat with when we see them walking their dog in the lane – and I’ve talked to people on the lane I’ve not met before when we’ve exchanged greetings when walking. I’ve used facebook more than normal, subscribing to some more local groups to follow activities in the nearby villages and towns – this has been very useful to see how local volunteering and infrastructure has adapted (it encouraged me to donate to local organisations to help with providing PPE). The one new platform for me has been Zoom – my Pilates teacher managed to get her classes going on this after a few weeks. So it’s good to have some online classes. I have been going shopping about once every 10 days – to a small local town -Aldi and the Co-op as they first open. Initially I was very frugal at home in looking at what we had in cupboards, planning meals carefully and starting to use up things I’d forgotten we had. I was a bit anxious the first time I did a large shop, because of seeing whether social distancing was working in these supermarkets but have now got into a routine which seems to work well. I prepare a clear shopping list – something I’ve rarely done before. (on local facebook page there has been a lot of discussion about how some shops and supermarkets are better than others at enforcing social distancing and that there are a lot of people who either don’t understand or don’t care about social distancing). I’ve managed to get most things I want – except, until recently, bread flour (I make my own sourdough bread). I have been going into a small shop in the next village for some things – they have installed a one-way system and I use contactless payment and hand sanitiser immediately after leaving the shop. We both went shopping this week, as my husband wanted to pick up his prescription and go into a hardware store. It’s the first time he’s been out for some time. But he won’t go shopping again for a while – mainly because of the queueing. I’ve felt reasonably safe while shopping because of the social distancing and using hand sanitiser. I’ve been more systematic about planning meals, being careful in making good use of fresh veg and fruit and using what’s in the freezer (freezing some meat on purchase). So I have a planner showing meals for the next week – something I’ve not done before and my husband really likes. Although I was frugal to begin with, and did seem to lose a bit of 2 Spring Directive Part 2 2020 Covid 19 R7467 weight, our eating habits are now back to normal (as the grocery supplies seem fine). But I’m retaining that planning and healthy eating approach. We’ve not been at all short of things to do. The house has been cleaner than ever. Not really hobbies, but we’ve done lots of things that have needed doing for a long time – for example, all the soft furnishings have cleaned; all the rooms and their contents tidied. We’ve done a lot of gardening – we would normally do this – but much more intensely and tidily. For example, the weeding has been so systematic, and, through local wood delivery to us, we’ve made three more raised beds. I’ve taken up more crocheting – fine lace work. So it’s taken me several weeks to complete a table centre, either just as a relaxing activity on dull days while listening to ClassicFM, or while watching TV. I’m not much good with a sewing machine but am learning – I’ve just made a few facemasks and have been intending to take up quilting. Now I’ve finished crocheting and am mastering the sewing machine I intend to start on that. My husband continues with his DIY and gardening projects, much as he has always done – but more focussed on garden improvements. Again, we are lucky in having the equipment and most of the materials to hand without having to buy much in (we are regular buyers online of some materials that one might have to hunt out in local shops). I go for 3-4 mile walks most days – more regularly than normal – but lucky to be able to access footpaths and quiet lanes from the house. I’ve probably watched less TV and more online theatre / Utube videos and listened to music more than normal. Some online webcams – e.g. Dorset Wildlife Trust’s webcam of owl family – have been permanently open tabs – it’s been fascinating watching pair of owls from copulation to egg laying to hatching and feeding young owlets. I’ve been reading a lot as usual – catching up with my stock of books that are on the ‘to-be-read’ pile and downloading just a few new reads on my kindle – no shortage of reading material – mix of fiction and non-fiction. Our personal hygiene routine has not changed at all – though I could really do with a good haircut now. I have been tempted to ask my husband to cut it for me – but I think that’s too risky – I’ll just let it grow and occasionally hack my fringe. He thinks my hair looks alright. Although before lockdown, there were some days when I would not go out, I would always put on make-up. I still put on make-up and dress as I have been doing (though probably using a more limited range of clothes). My sleep patterns have been similar to normal -mostly about 7 ½ hours good sleep. On days when I’ve done little physical activity, I can sleep less well – either taking a long time getting off to sleep or waking up and then being unable to stop those silly, worrying thoughts. This is fairly normal for me and I don’t think there’s been much of an increase in this (if there is a pattern it’s that I tend to have more disturbed sleep the night before I do early supermarket shopping – so still a bit anxious at times). My solution is normally to read a bit more (something unexciting) or occasionally get up and have a milky drink. My husband continues to sleep well as he usually does – and shows no anxiety. 3"

So far, none! My husband needed a repeat prescription, but he does that through a delivery service anyway. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. N/A How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I’ve been more relaxed, certainly slept better, and if anything, felt slightly guilty for enjoying ‘lockdown’. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Interesting: I am not sure how much of the decisions have been well thought through, and how much has been ‘knee jerk’ response, but in some respects they have been quite clever. Our lock down is not as draconian as quite a few countries. They have kept messages short and clear, and the population has in the main, responded quite well to the requirements. Have they made the right decision? Could or should they have made different ones? Probably (only time and the inevitable multimillion pound enquiry that will be set up with things have settle down will discover) but they had to make decisions quickly, in the face of relatively little evidence (if political decisions are ever evidence-based!) and appear, at least at the moment, to have got things under control. As a public health doctor, albeit one who hasn’t had any involvement with infectious disease epidemiology, I can see how they are using numbers, under the guise of ‘statistics’ to enhance and support their decisions, often without any real evidence. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Not sure, my crystal ball is a bit misty! But it’s going to be tricky. We don’t know how many people have indeed had COVID, and currently have no simple way of discovering this. We don’t really understand the disease properly, who/how/why some people get almost no symptoms and others have overwhelming disease. High tech solutions, such as Apps will only ‘work’ (as in helping to keep the infection rate under control) if a large enough proportion of the population is able to use them, and does so appropriately.  The Economy is going to take a long time to recover, and some of the decisions that will need to be made in the coming months will impact on this. But the Government will also be thinking about getting re-elected at the next election, so some if not all of the decisions will be with this in mind, so the poor, those without influence or representation will not be given the care and attention they need. It will take a while for there to be a vaccine that is appropriate for widespread use, and time to properly assess possible treatment options.  The real ‘disaster’ of the management of the epidemic is the care homes, which basically got forgotten as far as I can see.  I suspect they were considered ‘private sector’ not ‘Health Sector’ so didn’t cross Matt Hancock’s desk! The impact of the policies of 20 or more years ago, of ‘privatising’ care homes, of making hospital etc ‘independent’ in the form of ‘trust status’, and of decentralising things, has meant that the ‘NHS’ (which of course isn’t a single organisation, but a collaboration of many) didn’t understand supply management. Supermarkets had toilet paper back on their shelves quickly after the rush of panic buying, but the ‘NHS’ doesn’t have similar supply chain processes, so couldn’t do the same with PPE etc.  The catastrophe that is the confusion that has reigned in the care home sector will have a long lasting impact and will need addressing. Looking at the daily graphs published by COBRA, it is clear that we ‘missed the boat’ in terms of controlling the outbreak in London, but we have clearly now ‘flattened the curve’ in the rest of the UK, and in London too. However, I don’t see a lot of evidence of the curve moving downwards, rather it is flattening out a bit, so I suspect that we have infection rates under control, but have not yet  had an impact on suppressing the infection; so any let up of lock down will have to be very carefully managed to avoid an upswing in the number of cases. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? The wall to wall depressing news at the start of the lockdown had me turn off news media, although my husband was keen to watch the 10pm evening news for the first couple of weeks. So I check in with the BBC website from time to time, and review the daily briefing (I deliberately don’t watch it live). As a Public Health Doctor, I am perhaps more aware of the shortfalls in the data (mostly numbers) that are presented, and the international comparisons presented, although interesting in terms of patterns and trends, are not relevant in terms of direct comparisons for a range of reasons I could probably write a book on, (but won’t bore you here, you’ll be glad to hear!) In terms of keeping up to date, I get a lot of my information from the British Medical Association (BMA), mostly from their discussion groups, to which I access as a member of both the academic medicine and public health medicine subcommittees. Some of the posts include official reports and publications or scientific papers; others views and opinions of other group members. Both are interesting. My husband is a doctor involved in hospital management, and we share information with each other. At the beginning of lockdown, recognising that my knowledge of the infectious disease is fairly limited and out of date, and of COVID I knew nothing other than what the media was saying, I enrolled in the LSTM MOOC on the subject, and found it a very useful grounding. So I have had no challenges with accessing the news. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I have two regular commitments that could be considered ‘work’. My paid job, 2 days a week at the local University, and my voluntary work as a Magistrate in the locality (usually about 3 days a month).  With my university job, I have been ‘working from home’. Actually, I frequently work from. Home (or at least away from the office) so although not going into work itself was different, using the computer and the phone to keep in touch hasn’t been a big change.  Meetings are the biggest difference and learning to use the quite extensive range of communication technology was quite a steep learning curve, and fairly time consuming. It eventually transpired that ‘Skype for Business’ does not work on the most recent Apple Mac operating systems, but it took 24 hours of challenge to learn this, (and to swap over to using the IPAD).  And my wireless network, though adequate for most activities, does struggle a bit with some of these communication tools: I seem to be able to listen and watch, but contributing puts more of a load on the WiFi, and I break up. I haven’t sat in a court since the start of lock down, but have been involved in meetings and some training ‘on line’. I understand that work has been on going to get more IT systems up and running in the judiciary system, and that we may be resuming court work in a couple of weeks, of course under safe conditions, either remotely or actually in court. In terms of home life, the biggest impact has been not going to see my mother. She is 88, has dementia, and lives alone, in her own home, but with a lot of carer input, 250 miles away. my sisters and I have power of Attorney, and my mother’s dementia means that she doesn’t really understand what is going on.  At the start of all this, we discussed how we were going to ensure my mother got the care she needed but was otherwise protected from the virus. We discussed two options: one of us would move in for the duration, and take total care of her, or we would continue as before, with local carers visiting her 2-3 times a day. She needs supervision for most activities of daily living and does not prepare food for herself anymore. Neither my sisters nor I felt able to commit to 12 weeks exclusivity with my mother. One lives abroad, and the pair of us who live in the UK both have husbands and my sister a young family (my daughter lives nearby, but not with us). Fortunately, 2 of her regular carers were able to continue to care for her, stepping up their input, and allowing us to remove the need for agency carers at the weekend, (so only 2 people seeing her). So far this has worked. My husband, as an essential worker, has been working 5 days a week at the hospital (although only contracted for 4!). He is not patient-facing, and in the first 2-3 weeks was working 12 hours days, and maintaining regular telephone/email contact at the weekends. But as the hospital has gotten itself more organised, his work has settled into a pattern of 8am meetings, but able to leave by about 5pm. In the couple of months prior to COVID, I was doing a lot of travelling, mostly, but not exclusively related to work. In fact, I’d been away from home more nights than I had slept at home over the previous 6-8 weeks, and with my husband’s commitments, we were often only spending 1 or 2 evenings together a week. So the change with Lockdown was quite dramatic, but not unwelcome. Every night in together, cooking a meal for us both every night, and every evening sitting in front of the TV for a couple of hours relaxation. More like it used to be when we were younger, before our jobs become more demanding Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re­connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I am already a regularly user of commination apps for both work and recreation, using What’s App regularly with family and friends, and use Facebook regularly. I was less familiar with video apps but have used Zoom and others. Apart from the challenge of Skype for Business (as mentioned above), I haven’t had too much difficulty with the technology. And have used technology a lot! Certainly, increased communication with some friends.And very comfortable using it, for both work and social communication. And still using the phone too! My sister-in-law’s father died early in lockdown (not COVID related) and we attended his cremation service ‘remotely’. It was relayed via the internet, we were given a password, and sent an order of service, and we sat on our sofa, using Apple TV to link the lap top to the TV, and joined in. It was a good experience, probably more comfortable than attending in person, but I felt genuinely part of the event. I was also due to go to Lourdes for a week with the HCPT pilgrimage trust. They put together a range of virtual events during the week, some of which I joined. One event in particularly.  Using ZOOM, I linked with a group of about 10 others with whom I usually travel, and after a brief catch up, we then joined the rest of the pilgrimage for a virtual ‘Not the trust mass’ service, which was relayed via Zoom by one of the group I was linked with (if you follow me). As mentioned above, I have kept up to date with COVID ‘progress’ though discussion boards. And as a Christian, I missed some of the Easter services, but again, mostly through Facebook, I was able to ‘attend’ services, and as they were usually available to view, it was quite nice to be able to choose when I did so! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I have used internet shopping for many things for a long time and routinely use it for grocery and much of my other shopping, as well as having a regular milk delivery. So very comfortable to continue to use such services, and have done so, without difficulty, almost without interruption. But also keen to support local businesses, so delighted to discover a local fruit and veg service in the next village, and after spotting my favourite butchers out delivering when I was out on an exercise trip, to get my meet delivered too. Indeed I have not been into a supermarket since the first week of lockdown. As outlined above, my husband and I lead quite busy lives, and usually we are only in together about 2 or 3 evenings a week, and at weekends. During weekends we often eat out for one or sometimes 2 meals, so although I love cooking, moving to preparing a proper meal 7 days a week has been a bit of a step up, but not really a challenge, especially as I am home 24/7 and I have time to cook rather than rushing home from work and throwing a meal together. But while the volume of food preparation has increased, I think the style and habits have remained pretty much the same; perhaps more often I have made 2 or even 3 courses, rather than the usual main course and then fruit or yoghurt for dessert. I’ve had fun making some of my mother in laws WW2 puddings for example! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. My husband and I have been catching up with all the tv programmes we had recorded but not watched ( and we still have a way to go!) I have been working more in the garden ( see below) and have undertaken two MOOCs: one on COVID, and one on researching your family history. Genealogy has been a long-time interest of mine, but with so many stops and starts over the last 40 years, quite a mess research wise. So about 6 months ago I decided to review everything I had, and recreate the work from scratch, with proper recording of sources etc. Lockdown has given me the opportunity to get this work up and running, and I have spent many a happy hour learning about all aspects of this history of my family and that of my husband. So for example I have finally learned about the silver cup my mum had won in a baby show (in the under 9 months class, in Ashbourne in 1933!) At the weekends, my husband and I have gone out on long walks or cycle rides together, and have very much enjoyed watching spring develop around us. We enjoy bird watching, for me at least in a very amateur way (I like birds that stay in one place long enough for me to actually point the binoculars on them!) But we have been fascinated and learned much as we have explored our local neighbourhood on foot and bike. The Skylarks are amazing, and armed with apps on our phones, we have been able to identify birds from their birdsong, possible only because of the much-reduced traffic noise.  During the week when I am home alone, I also try to get out for some sort of exercise either on foot or bike, for an hour, sometimes longer if I get lost! In the summer months I usually cycle to work, and attend occasional keep fit classes so I am probably about the same amount of exercise as I usually do, it And the garden has also become more of a hobby. We were having some work done in the garden which was almost complete as lockdown began. In addition to replacing the deck, I was having some raised beds built to enable me to increase my vegetable growing capacity. So I have been able to do much more than I had originally thought I would be able to. Unfortunately, the last bit of the raised bed building, the adding of soil, was a ‘victim’ of lockdown, but since then, I have sources soil, and had it delivered: 1 tonne! Which I had to move shovelful by shovelful to the new beds: lots of opportunity for exercise! I do handicrafts and like to read too: I finished a book I had been reading for a while ( not enough time previously) and finished off a couple of handicraft projects. I have also been sorting out cupboards etc, and found so other projects, started years ago, that I am now working on with the hope I might get at least one of them finished. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Personal care as been much the same, although no visits to the hairdresser means my hair is longer. My husband’s hair too has grown, such that he is now having to use my shampoo and condidtioner ( previously it was so short it didn’t need it!)! Also, he is required to shower and wash his clothes every time he comes home from the hospital. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I am sleeping better than ever, and the sleep App I use to monitor my sleep reflects this. I have a much more regular and consistant sleep pattern, fall asleep pretty much as soon as my head touches the pillow, and wake up refreshed each morning. My husband too, is sleeping much as normal."

Age – 20. Marital status – single. Village – Urchfont. Occupation – student. Health: . I would say myself and my mum have probably experienced some anxiety towards the situation but only mild so have not required any medical or professional help. My emotions these past few weeks have been very mixed. With my immediate home life, I am actually very content at the moment; I feel immensely lucky to be where I am, in the house which I live with the family I love. I feel as though I am as happy as I can be, given the situation. Yet when I think about the outside world and take time to reflect on the extremity and severity of what is going on, my heart breaks. On Thursday evenings when the NHS clap takes place for example, I always have a lump in my throat and a very solemn feeling of helplessness and perhaps even guilt. Due to being so content with my home life at the moment that does often lead to many twangs of guilt knowing that others are risking their lives everyday either helping self-lives or fighting disease. Sometimes I feel bad that I can’t actually comprehend how some people’s lives will have changed and never be the same again. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? . I think, despite the recent feeling of the directions being vague, that the government have done the best they can, and the measures put in place are correct for the current situation. I think it’s very easy to judge the leadership and decisions made based on this outbreak when in reality they, among others, are facing a hugely difficult task of trying to deliver to everyone’s different needs. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? . I think it’s difficult to say as the steps made will all be based on how the general public act now. I think if people continue to stay at home and abide the lockdown rules then it will be a case of slowly and very gradually ‘reopening society’ with mass gatherings being right at the end of the line. I believe by July if all the rules have been followed, we will be starting the walk back to normality. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/ or hearing news of latest developments? . I would say I am hearing most of the latest developments via the BBC news app on my phone and social media but in terms of the news I try not to get to heavily invested in them as I feel as though this sometimes does more harm than good. As long as I know I’m following the guidelines admitted I try not to scare myself with news stories. Have you been watching the daily government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. . I don’t watch the broadcasts every-night. The only ones I have watched have been the ones given by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. I have to admit in a weird way I look forward to these, I think my family would agree it’s shaped itself as a social event where we all come together to listen and take it in, together. Personally, I like listening in order to gain more clarity on the situation or merely just a bit of moral support. It provides a reassurance to me that I’m doing the right thing by staying at home and helps me see the light at the end of the tunnel. I would say I’m quite an emotional person, so I almost invest part of myself in the watching of these speeches. It might sound odd and I’m aware I am probably the minority with this feeling but the speeches from Boris (despite not being a conservative) act as that boost I think anyone needs after being over a month into lockdown; it reminds the level of vitality in the government guidelines. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news?... . I haven’t experienced any challenges with access to the news, but I can image how for the deaf it would be a challenge. I think it’s a great idea and should be regarded as vital for BSL interpreter’s to be included in the daily briefings. If the Government aim for the messages to be towards everyone then they should take out the correct measures to make it exactly that. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. . I am a student, so I am currently not working. My dad is still working as he is able to do so from home and my mum has been furloughed. In terms of myself I feel lucky as I do have university work to complete so I’m working in that sense, but I currently don’t have a job with income or haven’t had to experience the effects of worrying about income. Has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home-schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? . Well in terms of my home life it’s been affected in the sense that me and my family are all at home together which wouldn’t usually be the case at this time. I would say at the beginning we possibly had what you would call ‘teething problems’ as I had to adjust from being independent and living on my own at university to then fitting back into the family dynamic again. I think any time I feel frustrated/ miss my friends or anything like that I just try to remember the situation I’m in and understand how lucky I am to be living with my family where we are all safe and healthy and to a degree enjoy each-others company! Technology Many people have been learning new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? . I have used Zoom a few times to speak to my closest friends and my boyfriend, but I would say I haven’t used it as much as some people. I don’t feel compelled to Zoom every night to gain social contact. I think because I get on with my family quite well that helps with not feeling this pressure. I am also lucky enough to be content in my home and surroundings that I don’t feel like I’m desperate for some sort of release. I’ve been in contact with all of my friends over social media via messaging and other forms of interaction so feel as though I am in touch with the people I care about. I’ve also recently sent letters out to all my loved ones as I feel it is both a nice thing to do and receive. I supposed sometimes I have maybe felt a pressure or even felt bad that I’m not Zooming my friends more, but I would say I find this a bit overwhelming and sometimes leaves me feeling sadder than I began. It reminds me more of how much I miss everyone. Contrastingly as well I would say in these times, I have also reconnected with old friends I’m not sure what triggered that, but I find myself speaking to a wider range of people than I did before. I use social media every-day, so that has been the main source of me keeping up to date with the technological world. I would definitely say that sometimes this is a happy distraction from everything, I don’t think there is anything wrong with watching a few funny videos and scrolling through social media to keep your mind busy. Saying that I also do try to not get lost in my phone from day to day as I have been subject to that becoming quite damaging. I would say I like looking through my phone at the end of the day as kind of a relaxant rather than being addicted to it in the day; I try to keep my brain busy with other things – this for example. Shopping and food What have been your experiences if buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? . I am lucky enough to say that it is my dad who gets all of the groceries. To make sure our home is as safe as possibly it is only him that goes out to get the weekly shop. In addition, he works for the NHS so is able to get I to the stores earlier which is a huge privilege for us, and I feel very lucky that we have that. So, no I have not personally experienced any challenges with grocery shopping. Have your eating/ cooking habits changed or stayed the same? . At the beginning of the lockdown I was worried that I would start overeating as a result of boredom but if anything, my eating habits are actually the best they have ever been. I really have no idea why this is as previously when I have come home from University, I have overeaten I would say. Maybe because my eating is one of the few things, I actually have the power to control at the moment so am making sure I eat the way that makes me happy and healthy. Entertainment and leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? . My brother and I go to the cricket nets in our village quite a lot at the moment – we both used to play cricket, so we always tend to reintroduce that hobbie in the summer months which is always enjoyable. I’m not sure if my exercise has increased in any way as I was active before lockdown started but I am indeed exercising quite a bit: 5-6 times a week. I am following a fitness programmes so that always helps to start my day off in a positive way. Exercise has definitely been my main coping mechanism through this: not only is it able to distract my focus but never fails to allow my mindset to become more positive. I would say I am also definitely writing more; I have a blog and work on that every weekend or so and just find myself have the urge to write more at the moment, especially poetry. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. . I have recently watched the series ‘Normal People’ which was honestly one of the best things I have ever watched. I am now currently watching ‘Peaky Blinders’ which I think I am late to the boat with but am nonetheless absolutely loving. Recently I have been running more and have started to listen to BBC’s ‘Desert Island Discs’ which I find so interesting, my dad recommended it to me, and it keeps me nice and distracted whilst running! I think I have a naturally curious instinct, so I always love hearing about other people’s lives, especially at this time it distances you from reality slightly. I am currently reading ‘Dust’ by Yvonne, Adhiambo Owuor as it was one of my recommended texts for my English literature course at university. Personal hygiene: We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. . No, they haven’t. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? . No, I wouldn’t say the regularity of my washing has changed but possibly my association with it. I think the value of personal care has increased for me recently. The time I take to wash and do my skincare I really make sure to value and enjoy. The idea of pampering evenings also proves to be important to me at the moment as a key part of practising self-love. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. . I wouldn’t say I’ve had any problems with sleeping recently but my dreams have been very vivid/weird. The dream I had last night for example myself and a friend were flying to Italy during the midst of a global pandemic with a famous tik-tok star. I find it difficult to remember a lot of my dreams, but I know I dream every-night all of them being very vivid. Sometimes I do experience sleep paralysis, but I wouldn’t say this has increased or decreased due to the current situation. My mum has mentioned also that she has been having very weird dreams, she has said they have been very random, holding little correlation to her actual life whereas I would say with mine, despite them being weird, always relate to my current life experiences whether that be the series I’m watching or someone I’ve been thinking about."

At first, it was really scary and certainly played on my mind constantly. I wasn’t sleeping and was very angry that people and the government were not taking it seriously enough. Watching the news from Italy and Spain was very worrying and I was sure from the beginning that we were heading the same way (unfortunately, it has played out that way). The week before we went into lockdown, I decided to keep my daughter off school and I didn’t go to work (did a sicky) because I was so worried that the risk was so high. Once the country shutdown, I felt better; felt safe and protected at home.  I have had to work outside the home but I’ve taken all safety precautions very seriously and also been the only member of my family who was going out to buy food.  I have also continued to be a Samaritans volunteer throughout the lockdown. It has really helped with my mental health, given me a purpose and focus away from the virus and the scary daily news reports. Going into school, has been the place where I have felt most worried as it has been impossible to socially distance from the children; I’m still not sleeping well the nights before I’m due into work. My daughter has been at home doing her learning remotely, she has on the whole got on with it very well, although 3 months in, she is beginning to get fed up (she is really disciplined and doesn’t usually require help from me or my husband).  She is becoming fatigued at learning on her own and is really missing the social aspects of school. It’s been just the 3 of us at home, with our dog and it’s been a happy house overall. It has shown me that we all get on pretty well and my husband and I still have a lot of fun together and see the world through the same(ish) lens. There have been lots of nice meals together and watching tv series together, it hasn’t impacted our family dynamic at all. My husband works from home anyway, and I have worked throughout from home with one day a week in school. Less travelling and driving around has been brilliant. I have overdosed on all forms of news and social media. At the height of the Covid wave, I was probably checking the BBC website a dozen times a day. I also took a real interest in world news and stayed up late to watch the Trump news conferences, the chance to catch him saying something so outrageous or offensive was addictive. I watched the government daily briefings at the beginning, but after a couple of weeks I stopped because I found it annoying rather than being reassuring. This definitely coincided with the realisation that the govt had taken the decision to stop testing anyone who had symptoms. The policy was just to test sick people in hospitals; it made a mockery of the daily infection figures. It made be very angry. I haven’t watched since. BSL should used during any government announcements like it is in Scotland. I love starting new projects and learning new things so I saw the lockdown as an opportunity to catch up on existing projects etc. At the beginning I was doing daily exercise with my daughter using Youtube but she became bored and it stopped but I am now doing daily yoga with my husband and that has been brilliant. I’ve tried to do some ongoing professional training and made as much use as possible of free online training but then I was getting frustrated when I couldn’t keep up with the schedules and ended up feeling frustrated when I wasn’t completing things. I should be doing more studying for a course I started in January but that hasn’t really got going. My husband and I have really thrown ourselves into getting our garden into shape. We have grown vegetables from seeds in new raised beds and spending most weekends outside in the garden has been good for both us. At B7496 Female, 47, Married, Colchester, Primary School Teacher times, all the meals that need to be prepared and all the tidying has got on top of me as it seems never-ending but I have just got used to it as the weeks have gone on. I hate cleaning so having to do it more often has been a real pain but I have kept on top of it, more or less. From week 1 of the lockdown, I suggested a zoom family quiz with a couple of friends. 11 weeks later we are still doing them on a Friday evening but I think the novelty is beginning to wear off and I think we are being polite. I think when we are all able to actually go out again and socialise will provide the natural break.  Going out to clap for the NHS was lovely and I felt a real connection with my neighbours. I hope that some of that community spirit can be maintained going forward."

Health (written 23rd May) My health and that of my partner has been good until today, when he damaged a finger doing DIY. I provided him with an Elastoplast and he’ll live, though laying the paving stones and demolishing the kitchen will be delayed. Apart from the Elastoplast, neither of us has required any medical or professional help. We have both been sleeping well. The week before lockdown began, when advice was changing every day, was stressful but after the initial shock I have just got on with coping and have felt calm. The quiet has been quite pleasant. As I experienced severe mental distress years ago, I am practised at looking after my mental health & do so without professional or pharmaceutical assistance. Several dates when I was due to see my young grandchildren have passed without seeing them, and I am feeling increasingly angry that the 4 year old may be expected back in a reservoir of infection (school), before I am allowed to spend time with his family. The Government (written June 1st) The government has been slow to recognize and react to this crisis.  Many people had effectively put themselves in lockdown before we were advised to do so, and testing or quarantining people arriving in the country has only just begun to be discussed. The government have had great difficulty scaling up to meet the crisis and have been slow to take advantage of private testing labs or UK manufacturers offering to make PPE. The Nightingale hospitals have been created quickly with MOD help, however hospitals have interrupted or delayed treatments for many other patients, which in itself will increase fatalities. In general the government lacks a clearly explained proactive strategy for dealing with the pandemic and for exiting lockdown. It has veered from ‘following the science’ to getting people back to work to reduce the economic impact. Emergency economic support for individual workers has been good but the current push to get people back to work and children into school has not met with public enthusiasm. Along with many I feel it is too early and expect a virus resurgence. Compliance with the lockdown has been breaking down with crowds on beaches and beauty spots, and many have jumped the gun on the lockdown easing (groups of up to 6 meeting in the open air) due to start today. It is not possible to convince the public to adhere to rules when the PM’s adviser Dominic Cummings has broken them and, unlike some other political figures, has kept his job – not a good decision. Contact with family or friends is an important factor in good mental health for many people and some households will prioritise contact with wider family over sending small children back to school or going shopping. Apart from planning  to increase taxes next year (which will not be announced just yet but surely will be essential), not sacking Dominic Cummings, and failing to reach a trade deal with the EU (I believe the government intends not to reach an agreement), I have no idea what the government plans to do in the next few months. Probably they don’t either. I feel unsafe in their hands. I don’t like the weakening of Parliament’s influence through this crisis, and I don’t like the government constantly claiming “The public wants” when there is no attempt for them to establish what the public wants. There is a xenophobic attitude to learning anything from other countries or to using anything they have found effective, which has hindered and delayed the UK response. There has also been a lack of consultation within the UK. Some clear plans made before Covid-19 may now be out-of-date and need re-evaluating, eg. the third Heathrow runway, as do UK priorities generally. That’s not saying such a re-evaluation will happen. News I often (not always) listen to Radio 4 World at One and PM, and usually catch some radio or tv news (BBC or ITV) each day. I also use the BBC news website and Euractiv news each day (https://www.euractiv.com/). I look at the government coronavirus data dashboard, the BBC Global pandemic tracking which uses data from John Hopkins University, and have also read the legislation and the SIs which qualify it. Local Facebook groups have been valuable in finding out about difficulties and responses locally. I have mostly listened to the daily briefing on Radio 4 PM rather than watching on TV, which is a better option as the presenter cuts away from all the repetition, sums up key points, and has experienced people on hand to comment on them. Boris’s prime ministerial address following the second lockdown review was a shambles – 10 minutes of repeating several times the messages we’d been hearing for weeks before any new content, then the lockdown exit strategy was mentioned with an explanation that was as clear as mud.  Husband “You can tell he’s a journalist and not an editor.” I was interested and watched the briefings when they began allowing members of the public to ask the first questions at the briefings. First day, lots of the standard messages but no real reply to the question. Second time I watched, Boris answered but didn’t listen to the question so gave an answer to a different question that hadn’t been asked. I didn’t bother watching after that. I think the press have done a good job at the briefings asking questions and pushing for explanations. Challenges with access to the news Because of lockdown there hasn’t been much opportunity to find out whether others are having difficulties accessing the news – people I’m in contact with seem pretty well informed. One neighbour has told me he never watches BBC or ITV news as he feels they are biased against the government. Surely it should be standard practice for signers to support government communications? Though in this case, a signer would be at risk of RSI (repetitive strain injury) because of all the repetition. Work and home life I sometimes have a stall at antique fairs or markets, which of course have not taken place. I will not take this up again in the near future. Because of hearing loss I cannot interact with customers from 2 meters away while in a noisy environment, and I will prioritise seeing my wider family without the risk of taking infection to them. I have done a bit of online selling, more successful than usual this time of year because no carboots, but it does not provide the social interaction or physical exercise which are enjoyable parts of trading and much more important than the small financial benefit. Engineer husband has been working from home, but frequently visiting work premises (no-one else there) for various checks so we haven’t been too on top of each other.  Lockdown has meant he was the only person I directly interacted with over some weeks. Local walks have been pleasantly quiet in places where there is usually traffic noise and fumes.  We have both found projects to occupy us – for example I have sewn scrubs bags – and he has worked on cars and DIY. We have no children to homeschool, but I have written letters to my grandchildren (2 & 4 when lockdown started) hoping this will encourage the elder one with his writing (vain hope, it turns out). Technology I have been using computers for over thirty years and refuse to learn new tricks all the time or to use a smartphone. My daughter has demonstrated WhatsApp, how easy it is with one swipe of the finger to create an incomprehensible message with predictive text. I prefer to continue touchtyping at my laptop. My friends stay in touch with email, telephone, and snailmail, very few use Facebook. I used Skype for business meetings years ago, to my surprise my account was still active and I have used it to be in contact with my daughter. Lovely to see the grandchildren but difficult to have a conversation with them both talking at once. Easier to phone the daughter if I want a proper conversation. Sound quality can be an issue – this is often down to the person at the other end putting their phone on speakerphone and then being too far from the microphone. The internet can be a lifeline for people feeling isolated, the local Facebook groups I have recently joined have provided a lot of local information and interest, though I have not posted very often. I originally joined Facebook only to see photos of the grandchildren. Shopping and food I was taken unawares with my first grocery shop after the beginning of lockdown, when many of the shelves were empty. This is now mostly back to normal, though in the meantime I have tried out small local shops which often do have a stock of scarce items. The variety of goods in supermarkets is less, and the prices have risen. In general food has not been a problem as my freezer was well stocked and the husband makes bread sometimes. Our diet has not changed, however sometimes our normal brands have not been available, and it is impossible to check the ingredients on alternatives without handling the package which means you are then expected to buy it (I want to avoid palm oil and savoury products with added sugar). I have tried to go longer between supermarket shops to reduce my exposure to possible infection, this means fewer opportunities to buy unhealthier items and there is less room for them in the trolley because I am buying more of other items in order to last a fortnight between shops. Entertainment and Leisure I seem to have been busy. In the first weeks I did the paperwork for my IT return, went through my late mother’s photos and papers, scanning some to make a digital archive for the wider family (this completed a job I began and paused 9 years ago), mended things, experimented with pottery mosaics (the only new thing I have tried apart from joining the MOA), and sewed scrubs bags. More recently I have done more gardening – lots of watering required to keep things alive during the drought. I enjoy reading and was caught without much new fiction to read, but European prehistory, history of the French language, and third-hand country-type magazines have filled the gap. There is a wonderful selection of quality non-fiction at Oxford secondhand bookstalls, so I did have a stock of non-fiction. We have gone walking more, and also taken the kayak out when that was allowed again. I don’t watch TV much except for antiques programmes, University Challenge (now finished), Formula 1 (not begun), and Family Guy. Personal hygiene My hair is longer and needs colouring, I’m not attempting to do anything with it myself as my hairdresser will need the business when she reopens. As I have been mostly at home and not seeing anyone apart from my husband, there has been no need for handwashing more frequently than usual. I wear a mask and gloves to go shopping, use handwipes on the trolley, and wash when I return. Apart from that, no changes. Sleep I have slept well, better than usual, and haven’t had any recurring dreams or nightmares. I’ve been fortunate than no-one I know has had health problems. If you stay at home and don’t see anyone, there’s no need to be worried. Being out in the world again will be scary, with the possibility of being infected and possibly unknowingly infecting someone vulnerable. Hearing loss does lead to isolation and even more so if you can’t get close enough to others to hear what they are saying. From this perspective there’s no improvement on the horizon in the near future."

Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few week I am lucky in that none of my immediate family have any serious health issues. I have mental health issues myself and have continued to have support from my therapist, online. I have been frustrated, like everyone, and isolated, particularly as I live alone. I’m not particularly anxious about the impact of the virus on me personally, or my immediate family/friends as they are all healthy. Nor am I worried about the economic impacts of the virus on myself/family/friends as we are all relatively well off, even if we were to lose employment. I am lucky I don’t have to live with those anxieties, but I am definitely anxious about the impact it will have on the more vulnerable people in this country, and worldwide. I am particularly concerned about the mismanagement, hatred and division that it is stoking in America, the world’s most powerful nation-this will impact all of us. The Government The decisions have been a bit all over the place, and I think they should have been more prepared. Surely ‘pandemic’ was one of the top major risks that will have been identified, if not the top one-we have had a couple of false starts with things like SARS, so it’s not like we didn’t know it could happen, there should have been a plan. They won’t do another national lockdown as they can’t afford one. This Government relies on a strong economy to be popular, and they definitely don’t want to raise taxes. I think it will continue to be inconsistent and confusing, to be honest. News I try and keep away from corona news as it just stresses me out and is out of my control. At first I watched the daily broadcasts, and in fairness I think they were well done. If I want corona news this is the only place I will go, as there is a lot of confusing messaging out there. It has been easy to access, but there has been too much of it! Work and home life I am still working full time, from home and did so through the lockdown. I live on my own, so it hasn’t affected relationships in that sense but has made me more isolated. I got my puppy, Maggie, on the first day of lockdown, so it has been interesting having our relationship develop over this period. I don’t think I would have coped without Maggie, I would have been too lonely. It has been tough at times, as puppies are hard work! But she distracts me, and gives me something to focus on. The physical contact too, is so important-Maggie cuddles are the best, she is lovely. Technology We have started using Teams at work, which has been fine. I am pretty technologically savvy. I used zoom for my counselling, again that was fine when our internet connections worked. I did a couple of calls with different friendship groups through zoom and a couple of quizzes with them. I also have had to go to some online conferences which have been trickier, much harder to focus, and the networking element doesn’t really work. I’ve been on Instagram a lot more, mainly to see pictures my sister posts of my niece (9 months old) and put pictures of Maggie up. I try to keep away from the negative aspects of social media, and keep everything in perspective. Shopping and food I never tried online shopping as I knew I wasn’t a priority and wanted to save it for people who needed it. The first time at the supermarket in a mask was weird, but I’m used to it now. It’s all fine now, definitely got the hang of it. Unfortunately I am comfort eating a lot more during the day, as I am at home all day so easy access to food and I’m bored-I’ve put on about half a stone. Entertainment and Leisure Still a lot of what I’ve always done, so lots of Netflix, iplayer and Prime. I also started rewatching ER on Channel4 online. I have been watching some of the rubbish reality shows, such as Love Island, to take my mind off things. And rewatching old comedy favourites like ‘This Country’. I have been stricter with my running and I try to go three times a week now. I also have to walk three times a day because of the dog (we don’t have a garden). I have been listening to more audible books, and podcasts-mainly Greg Jenner (podcast­you’re dead to me, audible book-Dead Famous). I find history comforting. Personal hygiene No changes there, as I am still running regularly, and I hate feeling unclean! Sleep I have always slept too much because of my anxiety. I have found having structure to my days really helps with that, but since lockdown all my evening activities have vanished so I sleep a lot more."

Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Neither of us has experienced physical or mental health issues during lock-down. In fact I would say the opposite has been true and we have felt better. We have both been more active. The only time we have used a car is for a weekly supermarket shop, this is very different to pre lock-down when we sometimes use a car several times a day, we always seemed to be ‘nipping out’ to get something or to visit somewhere. Mentally it has also been a good time, not when I think about the global or national picture with the virus – that is horrific -but as I have felt very protected and able to avoid harm, I have not worried for myself. I have also found the lock-down period quite calming; we are not trying to fit loads in to our day. Previously we would have been meeting up with people or entertaining at home – although these are fun occasions they do come with a certain amount of preparation / travel etc. all of which can create stress. We are lucky in that we have a large house so have plenty of room, we also have a large garden and the weather has been good so we have been outside most days. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I’ve had some sympathy for the government but some aspects of their management of this crisis have been shambolic. My sympathy lies in the fact that the government and cabinet was pretty new having only being elected back in December, and naively only had one target on their agenda, Brexit. I know scientists and governments do plan for this type of pandemic but this is something that ordinary people had no idea what the impact could be and, neither it seems, did some of those in Government. So many experienced politicians had been axed when Boris Johnson created his style of cabinet after the election. The ones who are in place now seem a bit out of their depth. Initially when the announcement came from Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, about paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers it was an incredible moment. I think the whole country felt a collective sigh of relief that people were going to be helped and everyone went into the lockdown period with more confidence. At the back of my mind though I kept thinking that Rishi Sunak had only been in post for a few weeks and he had only got the job because Savid Javid had resigned. That resignation had been because he had been asked to sack his advisors – which he refused to do. Those in Number 10, we were told, wanted to have more control. Presumably Rishi Sunak agreed to do that. So who is advising Rishi Sunak?? Do they actually know what they are doing? At times this seems like we are sitting on top of a volcano, just waiting ….. I was shocked when we were told that we, as a country, couldn’t source the protective clothing and equipment medical people needed. It was needed in vast amounts of course but I still can’t understand why we were trying to source it from abroad and that factories in Britain weren’t asked to adapt their production lines to make the stuff. The thought of hundreds of people at home sewing up scrubs from old sheets did help a lot of people feel as though they were contributing. Our local Facebook page was full of people asking for unwanted fabric, those offering fabric and details of people who were sewing and how many items they had made. That was a great positive set of posts. But the thoughts of asking doctors, nurses, support workers to work with makeshift stuff, and our medical services needing to rely on someone dragging out their old machine and sitting sewing until late into the night to create protective clothing from someone’s old sheets is something that just makes me shudder. I think in the coming months we will need to face higher taxes. I think there are going to be huge job losses. So many people work in the hospitality industry but much of it, coffee shops and the like, now seems superfluous and I think post lock-down that industry will suffer. I do wonder what employment there will be to replace it. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I have become a regular news addict! Checking the BBC website now happens two or three times a day, I also read the weekend newspapers in detail. We also regularly watch the late night BBC news programme. I did watch the 5pm briefings for the first couple of weeks and also intermittently after that initial period. I thought they were good and very reassuring for the general public. I thought some of the politicians couldn’t answer the questions well enough though, they can talk but I think the journalists should have been able to press home what they had actually asked; too many times they were fobbed off without a clear answer. The medical and scientific people at the ‘5pm briefings’ were good. This is probably because they were giving us the facts and that is what people want to know. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I don’t have any problems accessing the news. Having an interpreter signing is a good idea, it is inclusive. When I have seen Nicola Sturgeon on TV I do listen to her, (she is able to explain her answers clearly) I also find myself watching the interpreter, I find it fascinating how they can communicate such complicated ideas with gestures. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? We have had it easy. Our income has not been affected and none of my children have been furloughed so I am not worried about that. Neither have we been involved with home schooling so, as I said, we really have had it easy. My partner and I are generally very happy together and really have enjoyed many of the days during lock-down. It has at times felt like a holiday; friends who are in a similar position have said the same thing. Just being together, all day, has made me realise a difficulty though. I have noticed that if we have disagreed over something we have had nothing to distract us from the problem. Before lock-down we would have carried on with everything else we were doing and whatever the problem was would have started to feel less significant. Now though, the problem stays ‘in the air’ -we still carry on speaking to each other – but about other things – not the problem. I have found that I have to shelve the issue for the time being. If I have an idea my partner always initially thinks of why things shouldn’t happen. It takes time for us to reach a place where we are both happy with the decision. This has always been the case but now I do feel I let things go, just to keep the peace. It is, at times, draining. Emotionally I have found that I have felt a little suppressed at times. I keep quiet, to keep the peace. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have used Zoom for the first time and we have had regular, pre-arranged meetings with two sets of friends and one of our children. With one set of friends we have made a weekly date to Zoom in the morning. We used to meet these people for coffee, now we all have a break from what we are doing, make a coffee and then Zoom. One of the six of us is in the early stages of dementia and this is really noticeable over Zoom as, unless one of us says her name -or asks what she thinks, I can see that she can no longer chip-in to a conversation. It has made me realise how difficult for her partner it must be at home because she never instigates a conversation, only responding to others, even then she often asks her partner for the answer. This was not noticeable when we met outside our houses as there was always the environment or the other people in the coffee shops to talk about. With another set of friends we Zoom over a gin and tonic each week, in the early evening. These are people we would have met probably 3 or 4 times a year, mostly at sports related events. Here the conversation flows much more freely – maybe that’s the gin! It is definitely a more light hearted Zoom meeting. With both meetings we are talking to the groups much more frequently than we would have done normally. Before we Zoom, I do make a mental list of things to ask about as with one of the groups the conversation can dry up. We have also used WhatsApp a lot more. This has been mainly used for sending on jokes, or video clips -some of which are very funny. When all this started there was an enormous creation of jokes etc which were doing the rounds on the internet or by phone. It felt as though it was a bit of a race to be the one to send something on to friends before other people did. I suppose it was a bit of a reaction to being indoors all day and knowing everyone else was in the same situation. At the beginning of the lock-down I feel my partner became a bit too enthusiastic about sending these on to people. Similarly, I noticed that he had to look at his phone the minute a new message came in, even during a meal, and would be quickly scrolling through his contacts deciding who to send it on to. He was made to think about this when a friend sent him a message which asked: ‘Are you too being harassed by people sending messages which may not be always welcome?’ and went onto give some tips what to do about it. The message was very polite -but pointed. I think my partner realised then that maybe this was a subtle way of telling him that our friend was fed up with receiving these messages several times a day. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I have changed my shopping habits and I now shop once a week, at a supermarket. It has been much easier to plan meals as we have had no last-minute invitations to go out nor have we suddenly decided to go somewhere and eat out. Both of these situations happened frequently before. I now know what is in the freezer and am much more organised. I have tried new recipes. Some of that is because we are now harvesting vegetables we have grown but also because I have had more time to think about food preparation. Friends have also used WhatsApp to send recipes they have tried and want to recommend. We have not eaten any ready meals or take away food at all during lock-down. Our last meal out was several days before lockdown started when we met with some of my partner’s cousins who live in Surrey. As we were the visitors, we left it up to them to choose the venue. It was a nice pub near Cobham, quite trendy. Apart from us, there was just one other couple there and they argued throughout their meal, awful for them as neither of them was enjoying the occasion but quite interesting for us! The cousins couldn’t understand what the place wasn’t busy; they had booked ahead and had been quite pleased that there was a table available as normally this isn’t always possible. They couldn’t believe that people were obviously already taking heed of the advice that was being issued in other countries but not yet in Britain (the date was Wednesday 11th March), the barman said it was really obvious to them that people were stopping going out. On top of this the bill, for the six of us, came to a whopping £230! We have been saving lot money during lockdown. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We have had no trouble entertaining ourselves, the days have whizzed by. Initially we started on a big sort out and clean of the house but my partner’s interest in this soon waned. He has though gone on to clear large parts of the garden. I have walked more and was for several weeks going out daily choosing a different walk each day. I’ve walked onto the common, along the river, through housing estates, discovering some footpaths for the first time! There were some lovely moments. I was walking down a normally busy thorough fare in our small town; it was deserted. On the ground someone had used chalk to create a lovely arty design, alongside it was written the caption ‘Just listen to the birds’ – it was true they sounded wonderful, normally they probably wouldn’t have been in that part of town or if they were the street noise would have drowned their song. I’ve also researched a family history for a friend, and written all the evidence up. I am really pleased with the result. As I had the time I became much more creative with how I presented the information and have learnt all sorts of new skills on the computer. I’ve also started some sewing, something I have wanted to do for ages. I printed the pattern at home, it was provided free on the website of the ‘Sewing Bee’, a TV programme. I didn’t know this existed before lockdown. I’m making a little dress, it has smocking on it and looks similar to the ones Prince William’s daughter often wears on family occasions. I don’t yet know who I will give the dress to but am happy to be using it as a practice piece. It is so long since I have done any sewing that I have had to remind myself what my sewing machine can do. I’ve been looking on YouTube for short little clips to remind me how to do things. Yesterday I learnt how to make a ‘rouleux loop’ – something new to me! We have watched very little television. We caught up on a couple of films that were available on Amazon early on in the lock-down and the news bulletins but that’s about it. As we have had such warm evening for much of the lockdown period we have often listened to music in the evenings, sitting with the French doors open enjoying watching the night sky. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I have hated the fact that my partner feels he doesn’t have to shave! I wouldn’t mind a beard but the scruffy two days growth makes him look really old. He did however trim the hair on his head himself. We both still showered everyday and wore clean clothes. We have though been regularly in quite relaxed clothing, shorts & tee-shirts. This must be the longest time ever, since I had my first ever job at the age of 16, that I have not bought any new clothes! There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. My sleep and that of my partner has been good. I think going to bed without having to set an alarm because we plan to be out and busy the following day has really helped me to sleep more soundly. We live on a busy road and there have been a huge reduction in the amount of traffic and the reduction its noise, was so noticeable. These two aspects combined have led to me having a much more restful night’s sleep. I usually dream a lot, usually my dreams are quite realistic and I can remember a lot of detail. During lockdown I may still be dreaming but I don’t remember them."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. 1.  Health  a. Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have  experienced during the lock-down period.  During the lockdown my boyfriend has struggled with the interruption to his routine and  structure. When university was on, he had lectures and workshops to get up for, but  now this isn’t the case, he feels like he has no structure to his days and as a result he  sleeps at strange times, often throughout the day, and I barely see him because I sleep  at normal times. For me, I generally suffer with anxiety but actually if anything the  lockdown seems to have eased it a bit because I have lots of time to myself indoors with  nothing to go outside for, so I can relax more, not worry about social events, and spend  lots of time on my uni work. This being said, sometimes I struggle with boredom and not  being able to go out somewhere as a nice break, although I can just go out for walks in  the local area. I have had a lot of anxiety about my ability to do my university work  without much help from my tutors though, because of Covid I cannot just go and see  them and ask them questions, rather I have to do it online and this isn’t as easy as an in  person conversation. I really do feel like students have suffered a lot due to Covid.  b. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this.  No I haven’t.  c. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks?  They are pretty stable really, actually more stable than they tend to be when lockdown  isn’t happening. I think its because I mainly get anxious about lack of time to complete  my work, but because of Covid I have plenty of time to do this.  2.  The Government  a.  What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made?  I believe the government have done a fairly good job. Personally I think they should have  closed the borders to stop people coming in to the country who could have the virus, and  maybe put the lockdown in to place earlier than they did! But really the other decisions have  been good, like the furlough scheme, which has been super useful for people like me.  b.  What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months?  Open the shops up soon because they will want the economy to get back up and running!  3.  News  a.  Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments?  I started off watching the Government news broadcasts on BBC1 but soon got bored  of this. I now hear about the latest developments on the BBC news app, sometimes  people share it on Facebook and I often hear about the news from my parents who watch the telly quite a lot and then tell me what’s going on! b. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I watched them for a bit – thought they were exciting, like being in the war or something, a call for a united nation type of thing! But then they kept carrying on. Got bored. c. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Well, I would have said that was a good idea but it is quite distracting for people when viewing the news on tv. I don’t know anyone who has issues accessing the tv news, but I suppose BSL interpreters could be a good thing. Not being deaf, I wouldn’t really be able to give an insightful comment. 4. Work and home life a. Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Yes, I have been furloughed; normally I have a Saturday job as a viewings guide for an estate agent, but this was suspended from the beginning of March. In a way, it was a good thing because it gave me more time to focus on writing my dissertation, and luckily, I was still earning a bit of money (I think 80% of my wages) to keep me going (alongside my student loan!). b. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? I don’t have any children, so no home schooling of kids but home schooling of myself, doing my uni work from home! In all honesty, it hasn’t changed things too much because I often stayed at home in my flat to do my uni work except when I went in to the library. With the university closed, I just stayed at home…well, all the time. I did go out for a walk pretty much everyday (we were allowed 1 hour of exercise a day), but apart from the being at home more, not much really changed for me. c. Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? If anything, it has made the relationship between me and my boyfriend more fulfilled; we had more time to spend together, and I was less stressed about time, due to having more of it. Normally I would worry about having lots of things to do – lectures, meeting up with friends – and not having enough time to spend relaxing with my boyfriend. It was like I thought the time I had free ought to be spent on university work, or I wouldn’t be successful. He struggled with sleeping in the lockdown because any kind of structure he did have was completely disrupted and often would stay up all night, and sleep most of the day leaving me alone during the day, which I didn’t like, and often felt quite sad about. But I knew I had to get on with university work, and with no distractions, nobody to see or talk to, I just did. When we were both awake together, we had a good time and did not really struggle with anything anymore than before lockdown. In this respect I think we were quite lucky; I know some people haven’t managed to keep their relationships together throughout lockdown, unused to spending so much time in each other’s company. 5. Technology a. Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I had to get to grips with ‘Zoom’, which is a programme that allows video calling, and screen  sharing and the ability to annotate on the screen, making it a good substitute for in-person  lectures and seminars. I only really had about 2 ‘Zoom’ seminars, and in both my tutor did  not use the extent of the programme’s features, pretty much sticking to recording herself  talking to the screen.  b.  Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such  as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like?  I have kept in touch with my family and friends using Facebook messenger video calls. I  would call my mum about once a week if not more, and often we would do a virtual quiz at  the same time. With lockdown, people clearly were seeking things to do, and a clever man  decided to broadcast quiz questions out on the internet live, and people loved it, it was like  doing a pub quiz but at home. I would do these quizzes with my parents, keeping the quiz  video playing whilst having my parents video open on my phone. This was nice; when we  didn’t do this, I would just phone them and talk, more than I used to because obviously we  couldn’t physically meet up, and my mum missed me a lot. I called my friends a couple of  times but I am not great at one-on-one phone calls with people who aren’t my parents or  partner, so kept these to a minimum. I did message people a lot on Facebook, however,  during lockdown.  c.  Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure?  Luckily I have kept connections with people quite well; I found it no more of a pressure than  I did before lockdown!  d.  Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to  keep up to date or escape from the events?  A bit of both really, mainly just to occupy my bored mind when it was fed up of reading  academic articles.  6.  Shopping and food  a.  What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you  experienced any challenges?  Yes! It was a nightmare for a long time due to panic buying. There was a time when I  couldn’t get any pasta or much toilet roll for a few weeks; I had to use kitchen roll, and  luckily my local corner shop had a few toilet rolls occasionally. The big supermarkets  restricted how much we could buy, which ironically seemed to cause people to flock to the  shops to buy their limited amount in droves. Online food shops were not available for a long,  long time, due to the high demand, and at some points I had to get my parents to bring me  some bits. When I finally managed to get pasta again in the supermarket I was so happy; I  love pasta so much. My boyfriend took a photo of me lovingly clasping a packet of fresh egg  pasta in an ASDA aisle, and the smile on my face was so genuine. Thinking back to it now is  very odd! What a strange time it was!  b.  Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same?  I think I maybe ate more than I normally would, just because it was something nice to do. I  may have got more takeaways than I normally would too, because I missed going out to eat  at a restaurant.  7.  Entertainment and Leisure  a.  We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves.  Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise?  Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs?  Yes, I have increased my exercise for sure. I used to do yoga occasionally, maybe once a  week but during lockdown I tried to do it a few times a week, in an effort to keep my mind  sane and calm whilst I worked through the hardest part of my degree. I also played video  games for the first time in a long time – it was a game called Stardew Valley where you are a  character who inherits a farm and has to build it up and make it thrive – and I used to really  look forward to it after a few hours of listening to an interview I conducted with people for  my dissertation; it was a great way to unwind and escape from it all. I also did Wii Fit games  where I would go ‘jogging’ in the living room, where on the screen would be a virtual scenic  place that I could ‘jog’ along (just running on the spot) but the console would record my  calories that I burnt from ‘jogging’. I also did a bit of bullet journaling, but I did this before  lockdown too. I think I was so consumed with university work that I found it hard to have the  energy to do much else apart from it.  b.  We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading.  Ah yes, I forgot in the previous response to say that I watched quite a lot of television and  Netflix programmes. I made my way through many true crime documentaries because I am  really interested in them, and I watched several films like ‘Girl, interrupted’, amongst other  things. I didn’t read because I read loads of academic articles and books and I couldn’t bare  to read anything else, even fiction!  8.  Personal hygiene  a.  We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent  months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since  the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this?  Actually, thinking about it, I would have thought this would have changed during lockdown,  but it hasn’t really. I washed the same, and kept up the same kind of personal care regime  that I had before. I think its because it is such a routine engrained in me that even in a period  of utmost disruption I still kept to my regular routine of personal hygiene; just what I am  used to I suppose.  9.  Sleep  a.  There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent  weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you  live with.  I used to have major sleeping issues a couple of years ago, that resulted in me being really  poorly, losing lots of weight, and struggling with school work to the extent I had special  measures put in place for me during my A-Levels where I could come in and sit the exam in  the afternoon rather than the morning, to give me time to sleep in. During lockdown, the  only difference to before was that I was sleeping for longer, often to about 11am – I had  nothing in particular to get up for, so why not? I could do university work at any time of day.  Luckily my sleeping did not worsen during lockdown; I would have really been unhappy if it  had.  b.  If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this?  As said above, thankfully it didn’t get any more difficult to sleep.  c.  Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe.  Not that I can recall. Interesting question though, I hope you get some other good answers  to this!"

It isn’t getting worse and during this lockdown I’ve been doing exercises for it. I exercise for about an hour a day – half are adapted Canadian Air Force exercises and half is on a cross-trainer which I have at home. I was doing the cross-trainer before Covid 19 kicked off and now keeping oneself as fit as possible is more important than ever. I haven’t required any professional help although I would like to see an optician to open because I’ve broken my glasses and I need an eye test! Mental health: My emotions go up and down: as long as I’m doing something, I’m OK and maybe even when I’m not I’m OK if I just concentrate on the here and now. I get depressed when I put my head above the parapet and think about the long term future. When I hear people (there are so many pundits spouting their ‘opinions’ on the media I try not to listen to too much) talking about there possibly never being a vaccine, or social distancing being with us for a very long time, or just wanting to lock up the over ‘70s, I get quite depressed. I have a Faith – I am a Catholic – it helps. My son is going to go and live in Finland for at least two years with his Finish wife and their young son M, because S has been offered a two year MA in Helsinki university. They’re planning to go in June and I think their decision is completely rational – and were I them, I’d go as well. As soon as I can, I will go and visit them and they will come and stay here when they’re back in England. Emotionally I feel slightly side lined because obviously S’s priorities are elsewhere as they should be … but I try and not let that show and Sis a very good son -we talk lots on What’s App and the phone and we video sometimes, so I wave to M. He has just suggested that I might come up and see them before they go if I can (which I can’t now because I can’t go in their house), but I think that would mean an extra two weeks quarantine for them so I don’t think it’s on ….. but it’s a very good thought. However I am conscious of not allowing myself to be overtaken by the feeling of loss. The Government I think the government of this country has let us down badly. I completely understand that dealing with the ramifications of this virus is absolutely not what Boris Johnson et al. signed up for, but he is incapable of dealing with it. He is unequipped. He has chosen a third-rate cabinet who are all basically inexperienced yes-men. Johnson wants to be liked by everyone: that is fundamentally impossible for a prime minister especially in these tough times. This leads him to making some very poor decisions and being indecisive when people need leadership. Where Nicola Sturgeon gives briefings daily, he is more and more absent. Spring Directive 2020 – Part 2 P7552 There has been a complete lack of clarity in the public sphere. ‘Common Sense’ can mean anything to anybody – it is a nebulous term. ‘Stay Alert’ is a completely useless phrase in this context: the weather has been wonderful recently and beaches and parks have been full of people gathering often in large groups. I’m sure they were staying alert, in that they’d have noticed if anyone had been ill, but because communication hasn’t been clear it’s been up to each individual to interpret things how they see them – rather as I’ve done, but in fact we all need clear directions. There is no clear line of responsibility – this government, to quote Sir Paul Nurse, has been ‘shambolic’. Specifically, I thought it was mad to stop testing earlier in the year and now Matt Hancock says there will be lots of tests reliably available at the beginning of June. I don’t believe him and I think one of the big problems is that fewer and fewer people believe the government when it makes a pronouncement about anything. There is an increasing lack of trust – Dominic Cummings has just been found to have driven 250 miles at a time when people were told not to go anywhere. He will probably stay in the cabinet – Johnson needs him – but it illustrates that there is one law for the government and one for everyone else (and Cummings could have made other arrangements for his son). There has been a catastrophic lack of PPE and Care homes were ignored until their ghastly figures of infection and death could be ignored no longer (we need a joined up health system). Until now here has been no quarantine after travel and thus a lot of people from infected areas of the world came into this country unchecked, but Preti Patel has announced that its going to be introduced from June. If the government doesn’t differentiate between travellers arriving from heavily infected countries and countries where the pandemic has been controlled, they are mad and will do more harm to the economy than necessary. If they create corridors, people will find a way round quarantine …. what a mess! Why bother introducing it now? As for the future, I think the Government is so worried about the economic black hole on the doorstep, that they will urge more and more people to go back to work. We’ll have to see whether that will lead to a second spike. What they will do about transport is difficult because roads could become completely clogged with traffic. I hope they make masks mandatory – if everyone wore them on public transport it might make things less bad. I’m sure taxes will go up, and probably the cost of everything will, just as the value of money will go down. I am sure we will be living with the consequences of this pandemic for a very long time, both publicly and privately. News I listen to ‘Today’ on Radio 4 every morning. Sometimes I listen to James O’Brien and Maajid Nawaz on LBC – but O’Brien rants about the government more and more which is repetitive and predictable. I listen to bits of the World at One. I like Evan Davies at 5 on Radio 4, but often am reading, or out, or somehow doing something else at that time. That’s my last daily news fix except that I watch The Coronavirus Newscast at 11.45 on BBC 1 every Thursday. That’s quite a good reality check amongst all the half-truths going round. I used to watch the news at 7 on Channel 4, but now I just can’t …. Coronavirus is everywhere and it’s not good for us! The BBC World Service is a great antidote to this little Britain we’re all trapped in. Spring Directive 2020 P7552 I don’t watch the press broadcasts at 5.00 – more government, telling us only what they want to. And the scientists disagree with each other, as well they might – so little is known about this. I think there should be sign language for English news broadcasts. Work and home life I am retired so this doesn’t apply to me. But I am a Samaritan and have now gone back – having absented myself since February – to going into the centre (we can’t take calls from home). However, that’s not often and I like to go in the middle of the night (because people phoning Samaritans really need us then). I live alone so I’m not nearly as affected as a lot of people, but I’ve certainly learnt how to do Zoom. Tomorrow I’ve set up a Zoom call with a friend in Washington DC and I haven’t seen her for about 8 years. An old school friend called me last week and I talk to many friends on Zoom and the phone. I’ve also been introduced to What’s App Video which is wonderful for some sort of communication with my new grandson. I think I’m very lucky – or prescient -because I’m have a very good internet connection and a lot of people are talking about their broadband reception being a bit intermittent because its so crowded now. Some friends send out photos on Facebook, and I just look and sometimes comment. Equally I have a Twitter account but I don’t use it. I’d rather disappear into a book than spend endless hours online. If I do have more or less a whole day ‘communicating’ with people, I find that I get slightly annoyed and want time to myself. Shopping and food There was the loo roll challenge, pasta shortages, then tins of tomatoes, then breadmaking flour – which is still difficult to get, but now (May) more or less everything is always and everywhere available. I go to Waitrose in Hove because its very well organised and because its mostly used by car drivers so you get less people who just need to ‘pop in’. Shoppers are very respectful of the 2 metre distance. I have seen some really long food queues moving very slowly indeed – I think it would be quite possible to waste a lot of time on shopping – or maybe ‘pass’ a lot of time. I’m really pleased not to have arranged food deliveries, because however much I don’t enjoy shopping at least, sometimes I can try new things and its another excuse to go out. I also go to small shops if I’m passing one and there’s no queue. Just exactly because I don’t ‘pop out’ to the local shop as I used to, my food buying habits have changed and since I now go about every 10 days I find myself buying an enormous amount, stuffing it into the fridge and then working my way through it. I buy one ready meal as a treat, but the rest is fish, prawns, vegetables, salad, yoghurt, sometimes chicken, pasta, baked & new potatoes and lots of fruit. Occasionally I do the 5/2 diet because occasionally I pig out, which I always regret, but mostly I have a balanced diet. I think I’m probably eating better since I think about it and planning it, but I’m certainly eating more. Spring Directive 2020 P7552 I love(d) eating out and certainly my bank balance is looking healthier because I’m not now, but I miss it a lot. Having had been in a family of four for so many years I feel that I did my share of cooking and I’m not mad about it, but I do cook for myself – just not dishes that take a long time and I don’t cook cakes but that’s mainly because I think I’d eat them all too quickly. You don’t ask about drink, but I get my wine independently and sometimes I go through periods when I drink a gin and tonic, and sometimes I drink half a bottle a night, and sometimes I drink a bottle a night – after which I don’t drink anything for a few nights. Entertainment and Leisure I haven’t cleared my home at all. It’s fairly clean, but I have a lot of papers of my late husband and haven’t tackled them – partly because anything that would depress me I’ve kept away from and partly because I just can’t be bothered. My office, in which I’m typing and in which I spend a lot of my time, is messy and I haven’t really ‘tackled’ it though I feel I should have. I think I’m quite lazy and this hasn’t changed me. As I said under ‘Health’, I exercise for an hour every day – so that’s up from my normal half hour a day before Covid 19. I discovered a keyboard of S’s which I moved upstairs and plugged in and I was very excited that I would teach myself how to play the piano. But I didn’t and didn’t even send off for some sheet music. Since I failed Grade 5 piano exams twice when I was 15, I guess that my heart was never in it and I’ve now unplugged the keyboard and taken it back to his old room. A friend lent me 7 jigsaw puzzles and I find them mildly diverting: they certainly eat up time. He has also leant me a lot of opera CDs so sometimes I listen to one of them in the background. I’m going out – I would find it really hard be locked up and we’ve never been prevented from going out as they have in Spain and Italy -but I’m sensible about it. I go shopping, I’ve driven to Storrington (where my late husband is buried and where there is a arboretum in my older son’s name – he died) – its May and the blossom was wonderful. I’ve met friends – have sat on a bench at the required distance – with wine in a plastic Perrier bottle …. I think its very funny that this has driven me to become a wino drinking from a plastic bottle on a bench …. I never thought my ‘70s would be like this! As well as drinking wine from plastic bottles sometimes, I go out to meet other friends at suitable distances on benches – its really good to talk to human beings face to face. Tomorrow I’m going to go and sit in a garden with three other people (at suitable distances) and talk. Apart from talking to friends, the thing that I enjoy most is reading. I’ve been reading Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light, Hadley Freeman’s House of Glass and Alan Johnson’s Please Mister Postman. I have The Guardian online but I don’t always read it. I watch television – or something on the television – every night but I really miss going out. I miss exhibitions and museums but also the theatre and the cinema – and I’m concerned about the future of all of these. Apparently in Germany the government has given the arts some guarantee of enough money to tide them over ….. but that’s there! I’ve become hooked on ‘Location, location, location’ … its soothing as are Kirsty and Phil. Terrestrial television however is pretty dire so I’ve turned to Netflix. ‘Call my agent’ is hilarious and very well done; ‘The Eddy’ has great jazz, ‘Gomorrah’ is appalling and brilliant. Spring Directive 2020 P7552 Personal hygiene My ‘routine’ in the morning hasn’t changed much. The sequence of my morning is that I usually put the alarm on for 8, have some coffee until about 8.45, exercise for an hour, shower and dress. wash my hair and blow dry it every day and I put on make up as ever and earrings. That hasn’t changed … and if it did I’d be worried about myself. I hate the idea of lounging about in my nightdress and on the few occasions when I’ve been on the phone or an email first thing in the morning and therefore not really got upstairs washed and dressed etc until lunchtime, I’ve despised myself for it. Our mothers used to tell us in the 1950s ‘make sure you go out wearing clean knickers, in case you have and accident’ … I’m sure that my morning routine comes from the same place. Sleep Since I had children I haven’t been a good sleeper. I always have to get up and go to the loo – at least once – and getting back to sleep is difficult if I have anything on my mind. I used to listen to the World Service in the background, but I have taken to watching a Jesuit meditation online before I go to bed and not listening to the radio at all and that helps usually. Last night however, I couldn’t get to sleep so I watched two episodes of some rubbish about Ibiza on Netflix until about 3.35 am. and then got up at about 9.30. I feel fine today."

Fed up, frustrated and slightly concerned by loss of income as have my own small business and am not eligible for any government support. The Government Initially quite impressed by the overall handling – in particular the Job Retention Scheme which my daughter (E) has been able to benefit from.  Much less so now as they seem to have no idea as to how to get out of the situation and I now feel that we are being ‘fobbed off’.  Feelings became more negative with the Stay Alert etc. message.  Also feel we cannot live indefinitely in limbo land. Re steps.  Heaven knows, -they don’t seem to have a clue! News Brief look at BBC online, The Guardian (online) , The Week (print) No longer re 5 pm broadcasts. Fed up with them as they seem to go nowhere. No re access – thought that BSL was used in some of the briefings – am sure that the ones I saw were signed? Work and Home Life As I am currently busy writing a book (MS due 30th October) I have been using the time to try to get as far ahead with this as I can and maybe finish early … Wishful thinking perhaps.  However, I cannot get access to all the archives I would have liked to use so in some ways the book may be slightly different to the one I anticipated writing. In terms of my small business – this is completely on hold as I work with HE students who are now all at home and my work (dyslexia assessment) cannot be done remotely.  This is a slight financial worry but not too huge as the 2nd semester is always quieter than the first. Lockdown – seen a little more of my husband but only really in that we are tending to go for walks together and eat lunch together whereas in the past I have not always been around.  Occasionally we can be irritable with each other but maybe not more so than normally or other couples who have been married for nearly 45 years! Technology Used Facetime a little more to speak to my sister in Switzerland and elder daughter (R) who should be in Singapore but is stuck in Australia due to having gone there on holiday just before Singapore closed its borders only allowing SIngaporeans to return and R, her husband (J) and baby (T) are only on Work Permits. Have used Facebook occasionally – loathe it but to see what some friends are up to and have used Twitter a bit to try to keep my profile visible.  Dislike both of them! Would never trust news from these sources! Shopping Nothing has really changed.  Have put on a little bit of weight but more to do with exercising less than eating more! Have not shopped for food online – husband does most of the food shopping anyway. Entertainment and Leisure No time for these really due to pressure of writing the next book! However, have tried to watch either a recorded ballet performance or one episode of a serial with my younger daughter E (who lives in the same block of flats and is on her own with a 2.5 year old) once a week just to break the evening up for her – although she speaks a lot to friends via FT in the evenings. Reading a lot of Dorothy Sayers currently Would love to have time for my embroidery or a jig-saw but cannot indulge.  Have plans to do these when the (wretched!) book is finished Personal Hygiene I would LOVE a haircut and to have my highlights done! A very long-standing hairdresser friend (F) does my hair normally and as we don’t see much of each other this is a fun social event. Am going to ask her when she feels that she might be able to come over and do it but she is a stickler for rules so might not want to. I am therefore becoming greyer and bushier by the day. Showering more at home now as not going regularly to the gym as I sued to shower there. No strong feelings either way about this. Sleep I’m a very bad sleeper anyway but this has not been affected by Covid.  At the beginning had more vivid dreams but these seem to have tailored off. I do take a sleeping pill sometimes but try not to make this more than once a week due to fear of becoming addicted. Have a GP friend who is very anti them and so her feelings have rubbed off on me. Husband (I) is waking up even earlier than usual – 6 am is a lie-in for us and says he has had very vivid dreams but cannot remember them when he wakes up properly."

Portugal was locking down already and there was a sense that the UK ought to do so. My memory of those first few weeks is of a time of pure fear. Travelling home on the plane, using home-made hand sanitiser (alcohol + hand cream), wearing plastic decorating gloves that split as soon as I touched anything, I started to doubt our common sense in even trying to return home.   The first weeks were something of a blur. I’ve lived in some extremely uneventful places, so I was mentally prepared for the quiet times, and as I’ve worked  primarily from home since 2004, I was in a good place to find my own things to do. I’d even ordered a couple of crochet kits online so I had new things to do. I set up a daily schedule, which was easy to stick to as there wasn’t anything to disrupt it.   Here’s a sample week:    Thursday 14 May  Friday 15 May  Saturday 16 May              before breakfast   food shopping  walk  run 40 minutes        upper arms, firm butt     after breakfast       practical  run 30 minutes interval  10:00 pick up fish  10:30 Tennis call     bathroom  kitchen  balcony/terrace  after coffee      portuguese lesson  portuguese lesson  portuguese lesson     portuguese media  portuguese homework  portuguese homework  after lunch  creative  calligraphy  calligraphy  calligraphy  later  mass observation stuff  baking  post and filing  after treat   diary theme  diary  diary     mindfulness  mindfulness  mindfulness     7 days 7 photos  7 days 7 photos  7 days 7 photos            This all looks great, but that wasn’t entirely the case. I woke up at 3am – scared we would all die, seeing piles of corpses in the streets -  so frequently that I ended up following an NHS course to help. Insomnia always leaves me jittery and depressed and that in its turn of course is what wakes me up at 3am. So I was in a vicious circle. I used to say “This would all be alright, if it weren’t for the fear’.   We were scared to go out, scared to touch the door of our common entrance, scared that others in the apartment block would get Covid and pass it on to us. We washed and sprayed everything that came into the house.   After a while I would go for a walk, later building up to running, three times a week early in the morning and those empty times with the streets clear of traffic and only the runners and swimmers (I live by the sea) on the streets, were wonderful.  My husband went for walks separately to me. I needed some time alone and taking our exercise separately gave each of us a break from the other.   There were some regular calls that I really did look forward to, even putting on makeup for them. There was a group of women who I play tennis with on a Saturday morning and we had a call at the same time we would have played tennis. There’s also a group of friends from school, and I stayed in touch with them on WhatsApp, often exchanging messages and photos throughout the day.   Like everyone, we thought the birds were louder this year; we appreciated the time without traffic and aeroplanes though I’d never consciously noticed them before. I was grateful to every delivery driver that came.   I’ve never stayed home for such a long time before and we had to learn to use the full extent of our flat. A freezer went into the spare room. We sat on the back terrace, which we’d rarely done before. I took my morning coffee out onto the balcony. I could see young families cooped up in flats the same size and smaller than ours; I heard the neighbours behind us on endless zoom calls. I saw how lockdown gradually began to break.    Homelife  I talked about this mostly in the previous section. We did add a couple of new things to our routine: a morning coffee, for example. Little treats that marked the day into sections.   I’m more of a morning person and so I used the time before my husband gets up to go for a run or to do my own things.   We both have computers and we both would have our computers out most of the day.   We’ve continued in many ways pretty much as we were, though as my husband is 76, I was the one to go out more, to do the shopping and to take any risks.   I can’t see us going to the theatre & things like that for a long time. We have been out to eat since the rules relaxed, but always outside and only in places we felt comfortable in.   I can’t imagine when we will go to London again, which I used to do probably a couple of times a week, and I can’t see how I will be able to see my spread-out network of friends in the next year or so. This left me feeling frankly pretty lonely: I have few friends where I live & have relied really on meeting friends in London or visiting them where they live.   So now we are hoping to move to a new house. Where we live now is a flat in a converted Regency house. The area is much much younger than we are: young couples and people starting out. We should have moved some years ago, but my mum had dementia and was in a home and my husband’s mum was dying too, and we didn’t have the energy to move house.   Now, we hope to move a few miles west, into a new build estate, where we hope we’ll be able to make new friends and have some sense of community.     Media and technology  I’ve used zoom/facetime/WhatsApp to be in touch with friends and family. The daily WhatsApp conversations with my schoolfriends petered out as soon as the restrictions lifted enough for them to see their children and grandchildren. I had expected this, and it wasn’t a surprise (though I’d enjoyed the daily contact!). My husband’s daughter and family are in the USA and we continue to use Facetime to speak to them. No plans to visit, of course.   I started to do our weekly shop online and this has been a massive time saver and I will definitely keep that going. I also speak to my cousin and her mother once a week on facetime and I’ve been really happy to have that contact.   After a few weeks of lockdown, I took the calendar down from the wall and threw it away. There didn’t seem to be any point marking the days and weeks.   I bought quite a lot of clothes and stuff online, particularly at the beginning when I thought we were all going to die. There’s a pink leather jacket I don’t regret, a green silk dress that I do slightly regret and a couple of things that were frankly mistakes. But the shopping got us through.    Waiting  I haven’t perceived this time as waiting. I’ve perceived it as a time of change. In some ways I have enjoyed the sense that we are all experiencing this awful thing together.   Will I see friends and family again? I don’t know.  Will we go to Madrid for a weekend just because again? Probably not.   I miss the friends I can’t see and the family I can’t visit, but it doesn’t feel like waiting. It feels like things have changed."

Mass-Observer C7593 describes themself as female; age 47; single; retail worker.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","C7593 Female Age 47 Single Brighton Retail worker Part 2: Covid19 (update) Health For me lockdown has been very challenging.  I suffer with anxiety and am autistic, so routine is very important to me. I live with my 87 year old mother who has Parkinson’s Disease. At the start of lockdown, she was experiencing severe sciatica pains making walking or bending impossible. She had to speak to her GP on the phone and he made a home visit to see her. She was prescribed strong painkillers and arranged for social services to assess her and get the house adapted so she gets around it easier. We heard from them within days and someone visited to fit a frame around the toilet and brought her a zimmer frame. A few days later another worker came and fixed a rail at the top of the stairs, raise the bed height and armchair. As lockdown progressed her sciatica pains eased somewhat but she, being 87, remained at home and had various other health issues such as leg swelling and mobility problems. For me this has increased my anxiety about her and my fears of losing her. I think the government should have taken action sooner looking back now.  It was reported just the other day that if we had gone into lockdown a week earlier, we could have halved the number of UK Covid19 deaths. It is easy to blame Boris Johnson and the government for everything though and I feel he has been criticized negatively for every decision made throughout. It’s a very challenging and unknown situation for everyone. I think in the coming months, as long as there isn’t a second wave of the virus (please no!) other sectors of the community and economy will restart.  The problem area seems to be schools. I don’t have children, but I think the government needs to address this more forcefully as soon as possible. Another area of concern is hospitality and entertainment, theatres, cinemas, etc. News I have accessed news throughout the pandemic via TV, radio. Internet (and social media) and sometimes newspapers. In the early stages of lockdown, I did watch the daily government press broadcasts for the latest information. As it progressed though I only bothered when it was going to be a significant announcement.  I also watched the Queen’s historic broadcast and was keen to hear news of the prime minister’s C7593 health when he was seriously ill with the virus. I myself have not had problems accessing the news. I noticed BSL interpreters with Nicola Sturgeon on her broadcasts but not for England’s briefings for some reason. If I was in need of this, I would have been angry that it was not added. Work and Home Life Due to my health issues, I do not work. I volunteer in a shop and obviously non essential shops have been closed. So, for me, although it has not impacted on me financially, it has affected me in other ways. Routine is very important to me so having to stay in with no particular structure week after week has taken a lot of adjusting. I live with my 87 year old mother – no worry of home schooling thank goodness. She is quite frail, so I’ve become more of a carer to her in lockdown. I do worry a lot about her, so I’ve been checking on her a lot being indoors with her. Technology I have always considered myself quite bad with technology and my mum has never used a computer, doesn’t want to, and will not even have a mobile phone.  I have an iPhone 11, an iPad and laptop (Mac). During lockdown I have learnt how to do Zoom and done many art related courses through it. I had never even heard of it prior to lockdown. I use Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. I have been glad to have these resources at this time and have pushed myself to try things via technology which I would not have bothered with otherwise. Shopping and Food During lockdown I have made a physical trip to the supermarket every week.  Buying online was a nightmare especially at the start of lockdown with people unable to get a delivery slot for weeks. So, I went to Asda for our food every week. The first time I went within lockdown was quite an eye opener. I arrived and realised there was a queue to enter the store all around the car park. I hesitated wondering whether to leave it and go back home but realised C7593 there was no choice, this was how it is now. We all stood in the queue 2 metres apart with our trolleys at the ready. Once inside the store it was better than usual as there wasn’t too many people inside.  I just got my items, face mask and gloves on then paid. I remember everyone being very wary of each other and it felt quite hostile and unfriendly. It was quiet with no music playing, just announcements about the rules and keeping safe. My eating and cooking habits haven’t really changed that much in lockdown. I’ve eaten more pasta though. Entertainment and Leisure During lockdown I decided to try and focus on my art/creativity.  At first I felt a bit down and lacking motivation. It was early Spring, so I took some photos on my walks in the nearby park capturing unusual shots of the nature around. I wanted to try to document this time somehow. I then started some Zoom sessions and did a creative writing course based around writing in isolation. I had been going to paint my bedroom but have not got around to it. With the weather being so sunny and warm I have been glad we have got a garden and have used it a lot more. I always have a notebook on the go and use it to note art ideas, ‘to do lists’ and thoughts/plans. I have been enjoying watching my usual programmes notably Eastenders. But I’ve found some TV incredibly boring such as repeats of ancient football matches, cookery shows, property hunt type programmes and the awful ‘Come dine with me’ which my mum enjoys. I have been watching old episodes of ‘Top of the Pops’ from 1989 on iPlayer which has made me feel quite nostalgic as a lot happened in my life then. I listen to music on Spotify including 80s/90s music notably dance music and some current chart music. Personal Hygiene I feel I’ve stuck to my usual personal hygiene habits quite well in lockdown. I’ve not been so bothered about wearing different outfits all the time as no one has seen me.  Also, my hair is usually highlighted every 6 weeks at the salon, so my hair roots are showing a lot. I usually wear mascara every day, but I haven’t been bothering to put that on. I like my routine so I’ve still been trying to stick to it through lockdown with the things I can such as getting up/dressed, eating times, etc. This has helped me with some sense of normality. C7593 Sleep At the start of lockdown my sleep was a bit disturbed but then I got back to sleeping quite well. I have got into the habit of having naps during the day too as I seem to have felt very tired. I have experienced many many strange dreams in lockdown. Some have been re occurring dreams which I get quite a lot of.  One theme in these is a hotel type building and a fear of going up the stairs to the upper floors. There is a feeling of danger and fear surrounding the upper floors. I don’t know what this signifies. I have also had bizarre one off dreams. In one, I was going on a ‘day trip’ to Venezuela for some sort of festival. I do not travel and have never thought about this country, so I don’t know where this came from. I often tell my mum about my dreams when they are strange. One day she said, ‘it must be like going to the theatre every night’. Yes, they can be quite entertaining."

Female, age 59, married . Kingsdon, Somerset . Former public sector middle manager, and historical photo web platform founder Health Covid19 has impacted my health because I was due for surgery in March 2020. I had signed the consent forms and was just waiting to be called. My condition is uncomfortable but not urgent so I have to put up with it, but I can feel it getting a bit worse as the weeks have gone on.  I was to be signed off for two months so not a trivial operation. I am worried that if I catch the virus that coughing would make the condition much worse as it’s a soft tissue repair I need. Also, that I will need a bigger operation when the time does come that might be less successful. And finally, that the virus might get to me at the hospital or while I was recovering. Worst case I could cough the operation undone again!  I feel this hanging over me.  It also means I can’t do some exercises so keeping fit is harder. Other health things are also a nuisance. I was overdue for an eye test and definitely need new glasses – and then I broke a pair so I am very keen to get to an optician quite quickly, but no idea when that might be. I’m normally a very optimistic person, but the Covid19 situation has got to me a few times.  One night I just felt terrified for a couple of hours until I could reason myself out of it. Missing physical contact with our grown-up children most of all. The Government At the start I had complete confidence in the government. “this is what we British are good at” I thought. I expected us to have much better outcomes and lower deaths than the rest of the world not be amongst the worst in the world. It seems that we have all been shouting at out TV’s going ‘NO, we need to do X Y Z’.  Things that seem obvious common sense were just not applied. I feel embarrassed and sad and angry too. The ‘Dominic Cumming saga’ which involved the man who was the architect of the ‘Stay at home’ advice taking his sick wife 260 miles to Durham has caused nationwide fury.  One rule for us and one rule for him about sums it up. Some people have been fined for doing similar irresponsible things. On a lighter note it was fertile ground for lots of funny tweets and cartoons. I think the government won’t get any better at managing the situation. Some people will get very rich for the wrong reasons. Others will find their financial situation never recovers from losing their jobs or businesses or the first steps in their career due to the virus. The virus will linger. News I find the balance of news better on Channel 4 than on BBC whose reports seem thin.  We have not caught the 5pm news broadcasts but did see the special one at 7pm. At that one it did feel like a moment in history, quite unreal. There is no problem with access to the news, but access to stats that bear scrutiny has been a bit harder.  Initially only deaths in hospital were reported but then adjusted to include deaths in the community which caused a huge leap. But other respected apps give different numbers and, for example it seems impossible to understand how many people in total are estimated to have had the virus so far. As well as TV news I use Twitter a lot which gives the opportunity for seeing other opinions. I also try to listen to the world service to get an international perspective. I notice that a very small sign language person has popped up in the government briefings. I don’t have any problem, they are not distracting so if people find it useful then I’m very happy that they should stay. Technology Our company was already using video technology, but only just, so we have had to get up to speed quickly.  It’s OK for 121 meetings, but can be very tiring for group meetings, especially if they are for a full hour and are full of people going ‘I’m sorry you’re really faint’, and, ‘I just lost my connection, can you recap?’ The first really big meeting everyone quickly switched to audio only and I did not have much to say. Spotting the windows in the room were a bit grubby I found I was able to clean them very well while still listening in; satisfying multi-tasking. Now etiquette has evolved so that we are supposed to switch video on when we talk so it’s less easy to do, but I keep some sewing to hand, or something to do on another computer as I can’t bear just to sit doing nothing. I did try wearing different hats every time I spoke but got told off. Then a couple of weeks later someone else added a piece of clothing every time they were on screen until they were in full coat, hat and gloves. That time around it was appreciated. Perhaps it because it was a young man doing it instead of an older woman! We tried zoom for family, but its actually better to stick to speaking to one person otherwise you can’t get at what is bothering them, no one says anything personal in a group. We already used WhatsApp for close family and when I hear about very ancient pensioners getting to grips with this and zoom it makes me disappointed that neither my brother or sister will use it. It means we are left with stilted emails and makes me feel they don’t want to communicate with me. I have actually been writing more letters, mainly to older people who I have worried might be feeling lonely in lockdown.  Some of them have written much longer letters back which have been a joy. I have joined a family Facebook group for Australian relatives on my husband’s side of our family, but again my own relatives just don’t use social media, there seems to be a genetic aversion to it. Very frustrating. I put old photos on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram each day if possible and comment on other people’s posts. Managed to build my followers up quite a bit as I have a bit more time to do this. Shopping and food Shopping was a problem to start with supermarkets reserving online shopping for the vulnerable. So we tried to use offer click and collect, but are not accepting any new registrations at the moment. 7.30to 8am is reserved for NHS. 8-9am (Mon-Wed-Fri) is reserved for elderly.  Two metre distancing means a long queue just to get in a store and they advise you don’t come in the mornings when they are most busy.  But later in the day items were selling out. Many items were restricted to 2 per person. Opening times are reduced all stores close at 8pm. Government advice was not to shop more often than you need and try to shop online which was mutually exclusive to what the supermarkets could offer. I quite felt for people with large families who were told they could not have more than 2 of things. At first Tesco tried to tell my niece she had to enter the store alone, but didn’t have an answer for what she was supposed to do with a baby and a small child while she was in the store. She stood her ground and they did let her in after checking with the manager. It has taken a while for everyone to apply common sense. Could not get any onions or potatoes to plant.  Garden centres bursting with plants they are not allowed to sell – at a time when lots of people would be happy to do gardening. Many growers saying they will go bust as they can’t get their stock out to the market. Our village shop stayed open throughout. I used to volunteer there but its only now open 2 hours a day. Between 8 and 10 you can ring and place an order, then next two hours are for collecting.  The only place we can have a conversation is in the queue, from a distance and we are thankful it has been dry. Some shops have been very inventive. Many are taking orders by phone and delivering and guess what, they are finding it’s not so hard to do that rather than make everyone come to the shops, plus these are the shops that are doing well.  Two local pubs are now offering takeaway meals, order online and collect in the car park at a specified time. One of those pubs used to offer very expensive fine dining but now does hearty pub meals and says they are making more money for less hours. Meanwhile both the fish and chip shop and Chinese takeaways are shut ‘for the safety of staff and customers’. It can only be the government funding that is causing them to stay shut when they don’t have to.  The former just announced it will open next week – primarily because a café has now opened doing fish and chips and did a roaring trade on their first day, so suddenly they can see their future trade under threat.  A big mystery is our large hardware store, steadfastly staying shut when they did not have to be at all, and staying shut even though garden centres can now open. They have a huge airy store with only 4 staff on duty at any time. Again, it must be the furlough money and rates rebates that is stopping them opening. Our eating habits are the same, except for trying one of the takeaway pub meals. Missing having the odd meal out. Cooking is the same as always, but the flour shortage is annoying as we always made our own bread anyway. I do feel like cooking more, but have put on a few pounds in weight so that must go first as it makes my medical condition worse. Entertainment and Leisure I have still been working the same hours so apart from losing the commute I don’t have any more time. I go out almost everyday for a walk of at least half an hour. If I have to go shopping, I walk the quiet streets to get that in before doing the shop. On working days, as the weather has got warmer I’ve tried to walk before work as if ‘I’m walking to work’.  I have felt very connected to Spring and nature this year. Walking in the village most days I can see each small change, see which ewes have had a lamb or what trees have come into leaf or what flowers are out.  It’s been a pleasure and got me past a reluctance to walk some places since we lost our dog. It was hard going over those walks the first time, and the memories of our lovely dog made me quite tearful, but I was so bored with just walking around the village roads. We were renovating our house and our kitchen was about to be installed, but was stuck in a lockdown factory. So, we have been camping out much of the time using cardboard boxes and temporary surfaces. It is now fitted and finally all works.  Masses of decorating to do but plaster is in short supply and some trades are not working.  It’s down to who can afford not to work. Those who can have stayed at home. Those who are not getting any money from the schemes are very keen to carry on working. I have got to grips with a sewing machine I inherited, once I found the instructions it was a marvel. I have made curtains, altered clothes and have made a pile of more clothes to alter rather than dispose of. I’ve made dresses into skirts, taken in too baggy tops and mended things too. Plus, I’ve made a dozen washable face masks (with filter pocket) for us and my daughter out of old shirts, a pillowcase and some fabric shopping bags. I’ve also sanded down outside seats, but now find there is no paint to be found. It’s all sold out. I did have a push on sorting out cupboards and cleaning, but with bags of surplus things for charity shops and several bin bags for the tip piled up I’ve had to call a halt. We are watching the usual selection of programmes. My husband always prefers to pick from normal TV than search around iplayer, other channels. We like Killing Eve, This Country, Montalbano, history programmes and travel. We don’t subscribe to any packages partly because our internet is so flaky. It is so disappointing to watch a substantial amount of a programme for it to suddenly crash out. Once that happens it never comes back the rest of the evening. We do each watch utube videos as they are short. Its usually to learn how to do something, or to solve a techy problem. I had been piling up books ready for my operation so have had lots to read. I have been reading some new authors including Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, The Wilding by Maria McCann and Now We Shall be Entirely Free by Andrew Milller. Personal Hygiene Personal hygiene has not changed, but I’m not wearing make-up. I did to start with, but it got less and now hardly any. It would feel weird to put on lipstick when everyone knows you are just in your house. Same for jewellery. I stopped wearing a watch and my engagement ring as they are a nuisance when you are washing hands all the time. Now I have to remember to put in earrings every so often as I’m worried my ears will close up. I’ve dug out brooches, they have been unfashionable for some years, but they are ideal for zoom meetings and you don’t have to worry about the unreliable fastenings of the vintage ones as they can be taken off after the meeting.  As an older woman I do feel self-conscious on zoom and feel the brooches give people something to look at that isn’t my face. I like the way people on TV are having to broadcast from houses and that they look less glossy and made up.  All that perfection was such hard work and it’s telling us it’s OK to appear more normal. I’m washing my hair a bit less and its hard to do anything with it as it’s grown a straggly and an attempt at self-cutting was not that successful. What I do notice is my skin. I ran out of face-cream and simply could not get my usual one. I have bought different creams and even some skin brightening pads and serums and I am using them more, also body creams and its nice to have time to do things like painting toenails. I also have time to do my physio, and try to most days. It only takes 15 minutes but was hard to fit in on days I was working with a long commute. Sleep It took 2 months for the virus to enter my dreams in the form of a woman who was at a party and who refused to leave despite coughing and looking ill. Generally, my sleep is just the same hot flush interrupted event that is normal for me. It’s nice not to have to get up really early, feels like being on holiday. But some days I have got up quite early anyway because I like to accomplish things at the start of the day, preferably before breakfast. Sleeping in puts me in a bit of a bad mood."

I developed a skin problem over the Easter weekend, and after several weeks of buying various items of cream over the counter with no success, I was advised to contact my GP.  Like all surgeries it was closed to patients during the pandemic, so I was very reluctant to do so. I actually waited a couple of days, but when I did  eventually relent, I as was very impressed to be given a triage appointment that morning. I was given a prescription which the doctor offered to have delivered for me . I replied that would not be necessary as l could easily call in at the chemist while on my daily constitutional. She was quite surprised at that, and asked how l was coping living alone, and did l want my shopping done for me as well. I felt really touched at that, but explained  that although my date of birth does not lie, l had always blatantly ignored my age and  maintained that it is merely a label. As l said, I was very impressed by her offer, told her so, and assured her that I would seek help from one of her team of volunteers if I ever needed it. I was even more impressed a couple of weeks later when I had to ring again as another more potent skin condition had emerged. Without hesitation she asked me to come to the surgery that morning as she needed to see the rash. She warned me that she would be in full PPE and that I would need to have my temperature taken at the door, and use hand sanitizer. The normally crowded waiting room had one occupant, and half a dozen chairs were arranged in a  large circle in the middle of the room, naturally well spaced apart. As usual I had taken a book with me, but I hadn't read many pages before a slight figure emerged dressed in scrubs, mask, gloves  and plastic visor. This figure is the Senior Partner in this practice and here she was coming along the corridor to call out my name, rather than using the normal tv screen. I was examined quickly and professionally,  prescribed steroid cream, and told that it would be ready for collection in 10 minutes. I couldn't thank her enough, and told her that I would clap for her during the weekly Clap for Carers that evening. An amazing woman, who told me to stay safe as I left. I replied that it was far more important that she stayed safe. Many people have needed dental treatment during lockdown, which must be especially difficult if in pain. A friend was due to pick up a denture plate from her dentist, just as lockdown started. So she has spent the past two months trying to adapt to eating with three missing teeth! I  have a denture which l managed to drop in the sink quite early on in lockdown, but thankfully it didn't break in half. A chunk of vinyl did fall off though, leaving a jagged edge which kept digging into my gum. So, necessity being the Mother of Invention, I attacked it with an emery board and managed to smooth it down a bit. Not perfect, but not much else l can do at the moment. I can still eat, and play my clarinet and trombone, so why worry? As for my emotions during the pandemic, l assume like most people that I will definitely  not look back on this period with fond recollection. Immediately prior to lockdown, and for the first few weeks, I watched and listened to everything that I could about the pandemic. If I woke up early, I would listen to the radio, until it dawned on me that all this was doing was making me quite frightened and too much of it was infinitely depressing. Now, I don't turn on the television until the 5.00 pm briefing from Downing Street.  I have kept a diary since I was 14, and a journal for the past 11 years. On March 19th I decided to start a separate Corona Journal. For several weeks I wrote pages and pages, detailing everyday news issued by the government, and chronicling my own thoughts. After about two months of that, my enthusiasm waned. I still keep it up to date, but the written content has definitely got less. It seems that we have been in lockdown for such a long time, but of course it isn't. By contrast, the days seem to go very quickly and I always have something to do. The Government I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the government, particularly the Prime Minister. His lifetime ambition was to be PM. Would he have wanted it this way, I wonder. No leader has had to tackle a crisis like this, and I think that he has done as good a job as he possible could. When the poor fella was admitted to hospital with covid I thought the reaction was incredible. Even non Tories were horrified at the thought of the nation's leader being so desperately ill, and a lot of fear was felt through the country. We only have to look across the Pond to see how lucky we are! Obviously mistakes have been made, and there are things that would have been done differently. The government have had to grapple daily with nightmare decisions that none of us would want to make. The Health Secretary in particular has risen to the challenge, I feel, and comes across as someone who genuinely cares. Baby steps are being taken to take us gradually out of lockdown. As always the government follow the scientific advice, but whatever decision they make seems open to critisism that they are moving too quickly, or too slowly. They are damned if they do, and damned if they don't. A delicate balance between the health of the nation, and the economy. We seem to be on the verge of the New Normal. One assumes that this will continue until a vaccine is developed. News The BBC have always been my chosen news broadcaster, and despite frequent claims of left wing bias, I have not felt the need to change my opinion. Throughout the day I listen to BBC local radio or radio channels  2. or 5 live. The Downing Street briefing at 5.00 has been essential viewing throughout the pandemic, much as the 6.00 news on the wireless was essential listening during WWII. To me the most impressive contributors are the scientists, especially Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The authoratative  manner with which they deliver facts and figures with graphs, and above all the way they deal with the trucculent journalists and answer their inane questions, is a masterclass. My friends also watch the briefing, but almost all turn it off when it is the turn of the journalists  to fire their pointless repetitive questions, and spout their totally negative views and criticism at the lone politician on the spot. I stick with it right through, and do my bit and pour scorn on the journalists for thinking that they could do better. To be fair to the BBC, they have now introduced BSL to their coverage of the briefing on their dedicated news channel, which is a very positive development Work and home life From the very start of the lockdown I have counted myself very fortunate to be retired on a pension, and to live in my own house with no rent to pay. My generation, The Baby Boomers are often called the luckiest generation, and the current situation more than supports that viewpoint. I feel very sorry for  schoolchildren and university students who have had their education interrupted. The years between 5 and 18 cannot be got back. For those currently in employment, their future must be so uncertain, and as for those owning their own business, the strain must be intolerable. Two of my relatives and one of my friends are furloughed, and are very anxious to learn whether there will be a job to go back to when the scheme ends. Yes, lockdown has its challenges, but I have not been affected by the issues raised in your question. Technology At the beginning of March, I suspect that those of us not involved in video conferencing in the workplace would never have heard of Zoom. It has become a part of everyday life overnight. I have discovered it due to the efforts of the musical director of two of the bands  to which I belong. He uses it through his work and has adapted the application to provide band sessions twice a week. Normally around 50 – 70% of the bands sign in to these sessions and it has given us an incentive to keep practicing, and it's great to see friends on the screen. My own preferred method of everyday communication with family and friends is still the phone, despite the glut of other options available. My Mum's care home has Facetime, which is ideal for relatives living a distance away, but I  am fortunate that Mum is on the ground floor, so I can ring her, and  at the same time be able to see her through the window. I also  use e mail , texting and Messenger   to communicate with friends, During the first few weeks of lockdown it was interesting to see that many of us started communicating with ex work colleagues by phone or e mail, definitely progressing from the usual hurried message on a Christmas card! Shopping and food My experience of food shopping has been very good. I have a  large superstore of a well know chain 100 yards away, but for many years I have  preferred to use a smaller version a couple of miles away. The week or so before lockdown was manic, as it was everywhere, and shopping became quite a scary experience amidst the panic buying frenzy. However, within a couple of weeks, strict measures had been introduced, and order was restored. I have to admit that I was quite daunted by the sight of a queue snaking around the car park, everyone keeping to the 2m distance rule. Sanistising spray and paper towel was provided to wipe down the trolley handles, then I  joined the queue. I was there  for 20 minutes, but that was no problem as the weather was clement.  The store was very strict about only allowing a certain number of people inside at one time, and arrows on the floor sent out a strong message that progress around the shop was one way only. My immediate impression was the comforting sense of space, and almost everyone observed the social distancing rules and politely stood aside for people. There was a bit of a queue for the checkouts, but again it was well organised, and the cashiers were well protected with screens and hatching on the floor clearly indicated the space that should be kept clear. As the weeks have gone on, I have found that Monday afternoons are a good time to shop as there is no queue at all to get in, and I  can honestly say that shopping is quite a pleasant experience. I always tell the cashier this as I pack my goods, and praise the management of the store. They are doing an excellent job in trying circumstances. My cooking or eating habits have not changed. Entertainment and Leisure At the start of lockdown, I decided that to use the time constructively I would devise a  timetable to be followed each day. Things I don't like doing – housework, grass cutting  and decluttering. The latter had constantly been put off as I was never at home long enough to do it. Now I had no excuse. Exercise Music Reading and writing Evening – TV, phone calls and e mails Needless to say, the timetable structure did not last long. I still do all of the above, but not in the structured way that I had intended. Exercise is no problem as I am a lifelong fitness fanatic. I have had a go at  several on line fitness programmes, and now  I cycle or walk virtually every day, but nothing compares to swimming. Unless I choose to swim in the sea I will just have to wait until I can continue my favourite sport. Indeed I have never walked as much as I do now. I am lucky enough to live opposite a park, and I have grown to appreciate it very much. It has a beautiful lake and wooded walks, and I, and many others, have really noticed, and  appreciated nature this year as never before. This is one of the few positives that I have gained from lockdown. I have always been an avid reader, and am grateful for my well-stocked bookcases. I have read lots of detective fiction, and thrillers, amongst others. History continues to be a passion and a lot of the TV that I watch is historical,  or nostalgia related. Some film channels have been opened up free of charge, so I have taken advantage of that to watch films that I have probably seen before, but still enjoy. The same goes for some of my reading. It's good to go back to happier times, and I love watching  repeats of favourite dramas. Music-wise, I know that some of my friends have been very diligent about practicing, but I have not. I blow very hot and cold, and sometimes devote more time to trying to improve my piano playing, rather than the clarinet or trombone. I still listen to music avidly, and it can lift the mood when the news bulletins become too depressing. As for the decluttering, I have at last applied myself to it during the past few weeks, as I now have a goal. Spending so much time in my house, where I have had many happy years, I have discovered during lockdown that  I would  actually like to move to another area,  sooner rather than later. So a new project has evolved. Personal hygiene The only change I can think of is not washing my hair so often. It would normally get washed every day after swimming, and now it's just every other day. I cut my fringe, and am not bothered about not being able to go to the hairdressers. My hair is blonde/grey and I am glad that I have never had it coloured. On a slightly different tack, I normally  never go out without wearing mascara. I haven't used it for weeks now, as my social life has been somewhat curtailed! When I am outdoors I wear sunglasses anyway, so there is no point is there? I most certainly will resume wearing it though when normal life resumes, as blonde eyelashes look almost  invisible.  Sleep At the start of lockdown I learnt that it was foolhardy to listen to the radio in the middle of the night – much too depressing. If I go to bed too early I don't sleep well, so I normally turn in between 1130 and midnight. I always read before putting the light out. I do tend to wake up quite early, probably around 6.00 and sometimes tune in to the breakfast radio programmes, Sometimes they do send me back to sleep, and that is when I have experienced some very strange dreams. They are very vivid at the time, but quickly forgotten."

I live in Littlehampton and have lived in Sussex since coming to University in xxxxx. May 12 2020 Woke at 6am, exhausted, as I hadn’t been able to sleep very well, too many thoughts in my head. I remember the living room clock chimed the half hour at 2.30am. I must have finally fallen asleep then. Heard the interview on BBC Sussex about the Mass Observation today so decided to note down what I do throughout the day. I felt so tired I didn’t do the 30 minute cardio this morning. I’ll go out on my bike later, for my government approved daily outdoor exercise, that is if the wind dies down. It’s been so strong these last few days that I’ll be pedalling and going nowhere if I try the seafront heading east. Got up before 8am because it’s bin day and I don’t put them out the night before because of foxes and seagulls attacking them. Two of my neighbours opposite were talking to each other, about 2 metres apart, I looked across to wave or greet them, but they remained in conversation. The radio traffic news was reporting some tailbacks in the usual places! That’s the first for weeks. Hardly surprising following the Government’s suggestion that people return to work, even though over 3000 people tested positive for the virus yesterday and hundreds are still dying each day. This disease is nowhere near under control, we should have held tight another few weeks perhaps, like Scotland, Wales and NI are doing. Economic recovery would be quicker if the workforce is not fluctuating with quarantining or illness. What a shame the Government hasn’t taken this pause in life to implement positive environmentally impactful changes in our culture. Any unforeseen benefit to the planet from this dreadful pandemic will be lost in the rush to ‘get back to normal’. Cleaner water, unpolluted air and returning wildlife to some places will be lost with no effort to preserve it. I despair when I hear on the radio that Ryan Air expect to be back to 40% flights by July. International travel is a key factor in the rapid spread of coronavirus, which resulted in governments being ill-prepared to tackle it. Not to mention the pollution. We need to re-think our whole way of life on this planet, and find alternative ways to live and work that are more sustainable. We need to find other ways to work that can still be fulfilling careers. All the hoo-ha in the media from politicians, celebrities and citizens claiming the positives to this enforced lockdown in the pace of life, time well-spent with families, quiet, bird-song etc is being instantly forgotten in our misguided self-interest. It’s depressing. My daughter has emerged for breakfast. I need to get some work done before the conference call at 11am. Hoping we’ll be told we can go back to work. We have suggested shift patterns and ways to socially distance in the office, we are doing all we can from home, but somethings require us to be in the office. I’ve never used my laptop so much. I have to charge up during the day. I have an email from my colleague. She hasn’t been able to get one of the links to work in my poetry Tweet for today. A Tweet about limericks without a link to Edward Lear, c’est la vie! I have an email from the school I applied to acknowledging receipt of my job application. 10.45am Searching the internet for books with colours in the title. I thought a booklist for schools inspired by the current rainbow theme would be fun. I’m sure we have a picture book about an owl 12 May 2020 and an orange scarf, can’t remember the title. G has gone upstairs to work in her brother’s room. The light is much better in his room with it facing south. She needs good light for the intricate engraving she’s doing. My hands are actually freezing while I type, it’s so cold in the house today. 1pm Just finished the conference call then had my colleague texting me. She is as frustrated and upset as I am. How often do we have to keep explaining our jobs to our manager?  We even had to explain why it was impossible to socially distance on the mobile library van!! He doesn’t understand the process of what we do. We have so much work to catch up with. He’s told us we each have to do 2 shifts a week for the foreseeable, for the Council’s contacting vulnerable residents call service (at the public library nearest to us) where tape has been put down to create 2m distances and sprays and wipes provided to clean laptops, yet we can’t go into our basement office to unpack and shelve boxes of books that have sat untouched for 7 weeks? Nor will he say when our office will be risk assessed and sorted for us to return to because the government didn’t mention that public libraries could open. Yet the Council have opened public libraries to use them as call centres? How many times do we have to tell him we have customers who pay us directly for a book delivery service and the schools have never closed?! My colleague and I exchanged several text messages of frustration. G and I had lunch. We both forgot to get more bread out of the freezer so she finished the loaf and I had Ryvita with my cheese. 2pm G went back up to work. I reminded her to send a link to my friend M so they can showcase their different skills on each other’s online platforms. G is hoping she might hear about some work if theatres open again for the autumn I worked on some documents for my professional registration whilst listening to a webinar about school libraries returning after lockdown. Had a text from L asking how we are, had a little vent about the conference call. She wasn’t surprised. 4.20pm The wind seems to have dropped, so I dragged the bikes out of the shed, pumped up all the tyres and G and I headed out for a cycle. It was noticeably busier with cars on the roads. G struggled a little even though she had taken her inhaler before leaving the house. She says she never used it whilst at Uni so I am concerned how often she needs it now she is back home. 5 pm G helped me measure out the hole we created in the garden for the raised bed. We also measured the path through the wooded area so I can order one load of stones for both jobs. Just need to search the internet to find a local supplier who will do home deliveries. Evening G and I discussed our evening meal. We need to eat up the leftover mince from 2 days ago, so we decided to roast some sweet potato cubes and the carrot that was peeled but not used 2 days ago, with the last of the frozen roast potatoes. As we are putting on the oven we’ll have the fruit strudel with the last of the Ben & Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie ice cream. Dinner on trays while G and I watch the tv. It was very tasty. I texted my niece to see how she and the girls are doing. They were into school last week (my niece is a keyworker) and did some work about VE day. I suggested they talk to Mum as she was 12 at the end of the war and would remember VE day. Before it got too dark I popped out to do some watering as it hasn’t rained after all. The peas and carrots are looking quite dry. Find some snails in the hosta pots so I make up some garlic spray. I also spray lavender around as there were several cats in the garden today. Lavender seems to put some 12 May 2020 of them off pooing in my borders. I’ll water again tomorrow morning as I don’t want to attract the slugs to my veg overnight. Not much on the tv, we started watching a film because I recognized the title and wondered if it was a book. G knew it, and said it she didn’t think the films (it’s a series of books) had received good reviews because fans of the books didn’t think the adaptations were as good as the books. I lost interest after about half an hour and read through my library quarterly magazine. I marked a few things in articles to check out tomorrow on the internet. G made drinks before bed tonight. I didn’t want hot chocolate, it’s quite sweet so she just added more hot water to my fruit infusion from earlier today. After the last episode of the BBC show ‘I’ll Get This’ quite entertaining tonight, but then I like Sue Perkins and Jonny Vegas, I headed to bed. “I donate my 12th May diary to the Mass Observation Archive.

Mass-Observer C3210 describes themself as female; age 40; 'civil partnered with one six-year-old son'; freelance IT consultant.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","C3210 MOP #C3210 Biographical info: Age: 40 Gender: Female Currently living: Watford, Hertfordshire Marital status: Civil partnered with one six year-old son Occupation: Freelance IT Consultant Autumn 2020 directive part 2: Everyday health and well-being Saturday 2nd Jan 2021 To me, the term ‘health’ is related to physical health in the first instance, rather than mental health. So when, as has often been the case over the last year, someone says “Oh well, at least we’ve got our health”, I would take that to mean, at least we are physically healthy. Wellbeing, on the other hand, encompasses both physical and mental health, so to me it’s about taking a holistic approach to health, for example eating a good diet and exercising, not only as a way of preserving physical health, but a way of looking after mental health as well. When I imagine a healthy body I think of the words: slim, toned, smoke-free, exercise, vegetables I don’t think of a specific person – I guess I think of a generic ‘fit’ woman body that we see plastered over social media constantly, so a slim woman in a crop top, leggings, trainers with a white-toothed smile and sparkly eyes. This is what we’re all supposed to look like after our 5am yoga session followed by herbal tea and some overnight oats. My own experience of health has definitely been influenced by my gender – well sex, if we’re being picky, because most of the health issues I’ve had have been a direct result of being female: ectopic pregnancy, impact of c-section and pregnancy, POI (premature ovarian insufficiency/early menopause). Picked up on Sat 30 Jan 2021 All of the above health issues have been problematic for me. I was treated really badly in hospital after the ectopic and in the end had to seek support from a charity and via my employer’s private counselling service. With the c-section, I found it pretty shocking how quickly I was expected to just get on with it. I left hospital less than 48 hrs after I’d given birth and had to inject myself with painkillers. My stitches split a few days later and I had to rush back into hospital. The POI has been the worst tho. I’ve been passed from pillar to post and have had to push so hard to get seen by a specialist. I’m now on the third or fourth regime of treatment, which I’ll be on for the next 10 years under annual review. It feels like such a fight. I know it’s a cliché to say, but if these were issues that men faced, I think they would be taken much more seriously. I learnt about health from my mum. Really, the extent of it was eat healthy foods and get fresh air and exercise. My mum had (and has, actually) a real aversion to me being ill. It felt like I wasn’t allowed to be ill. The attitude was ‘oh just get on with it’. I think that’s partly why even now I find it hard to stop and take a day off even when I am ill. I’ve gone to work with really bad back pain, bad depression, colds of course – I’ve even worked through a painful bout of the shingles. I’m getting better at stopping now and realising when I need to take care of myself. I’ve not really become aware of wellbeing until the last 5-10 yrs I guess. Partly because I don’t think it was a thing. Health was all about physical health, not mental health. I think it’s much better now there’s a general recognition that the two go hand in hand. C3210 I don’t remember being taught much about health at school. A bit in science classes I suppose and we probably learnt a bit about nutrition in ‘Home Economics’. These days I mostly learn from articles on the internet or in magazines and books – but I’m careful about what I read. I won’t just believe any old  hokum. If I’m looking for information about specific conditions I will always look on the NHS website. I think I was first aware of puberty when I got my period – actually probably when my twin sis got hers – about a month before mine. We’d had the ‘period talk’ at school, so I knew what to expect. Mum didn’t talk to us much about it, though I remember her saying she’d show me how to insert a tampon if I wanted. That really grossed me out and I said thanks but no thanks. I also remember furtively trying to shave my legs with my dad’s bic razor. I was so scared about being found that I took it into the little loo with a sponge and did it there. Not very successfully I think! Looking back I really took my body for granted – I hardly exercised and yet really I must have been really slim. I think I must have had a high metabolism, because I used to eat so much junk when I was with friends. When I was at uni I went through a period of not being able to eat. I don’t think it was anorexia because I wanted to eat, but the thought of food made me feel sick. God it must have been a worry for my mum. I remember I used to go to the supermarket and walk up and down, up and down until I saw something, anything that I felt like eating. I guess it must have been some anxiety or something. I was so thin, nearly 3st lighter than now (I’m between 11.5-12 stone now and 5ft 10). I only ever swam once a week, if that. I’ve always enjoyed swimming. When I first moved to London I went once a week. I was eating a lot more than I do now but again, managed to stay around 10st. Actually I think I was walking for about 30 mins a day as part of my commute, so I guess that helped. But I was drinking a lot! Now I know I have to make exercise part of my routine. Partly for my back and general health, but also for my mental health. After I moved to Watford I joined a gym and I was going to 2/3 classes a week and running. It helped me pull myself out of a dark period in my life. That’s why I’m finding the winter lockdown so difficult – after the last lockdown I’d starting going back to the pool 2-3 times a week – I injured my ankle last June so haven’t run since then and with it being winter it’s difficult to fit running round work and home­schooling. Right now I’m really not doing much exercise at all and I can feel it. A has bought some resistance bands and I’ve done a session this morning. I’m also trying to do some yoga. Now I can see the positive benefits of exercise, especially on my mental health, I’m more keen to try and fit it in. I really want to buy a folding exercise bike, but they’re all out of stock. I’m looking forward to the clocks changing so there’s more light. I think I will try running again then. As I get older I know I will prioritise exercise. Even though it does give me a mental high, if I could get away without doing it and sitting and reading a book instead, then I would. But I know I need to do it to stay healthy, especially as I sit at a computer every day for work. I do see a connection between a healthy lifestyle and physical appearance but I try to keep reminding myself that the beautiful people plastered over Instagram etc probably spend a lot more time and money on it than I’ll ever be able to. Also, I like food. I have friends who love me for who I am, not what I look like. So even though we’d all like to have a flat tummy and look like we just woke up from 10 hours sleep, really I’d rather eat the cake and have a laugh than spend all that time and energy analysing everything I put in my body just so I can show a six pack on Instagram. It must be so boring. The one thing that really bothers me about my appearance, and is probably linked to my wellbeing, is my dark circles. There’s hardly a month that goes by when I don’t buy yet another product that will apparently rid me of them. Of course what would really work is different genes and a cure for insomnia. Right now they’re really bad because I’m starting work at 7am every day and get only 4-5 hours sleep a night. They are the first thing I see when I look in the mirror and they make me feel like shit. Also it really pisses me off when C3210 people greet me by telling me how tired I look. Why do people do that? Do they imagine it makes me feel better about myself? The other night I caught myself watching a 20 minute you tube video on how to apply eye make up to make you look more awake. Then I realised that, as it was 11.30pm, a better idea would probably be to stop watching you tube and go to sleep. My mum has never been a big make-up person. She doesn’t wear anything day to day and all she’s ever put on her face is Johnson’s baby lotion. Yet she’s 73 and doesn’t have any wrinkles. It’s the one advantage of having oily skin, she tells me. Well, I share that trait, so hopefully I will also be wrinkle free into my old age. Although really, what’s so wrong with wrinkles? We’re conditioned to fear them, but all they show is that you’ve lived and survived life. The only thing I remember about mum getting ready is her putting a bit of foundation and mascara on – and the hair tongs. She was forever putting her hair in a wave in the 80s because it’s dead straight. Of course now that’s the thing. My mum has had the same haircut the whole time pretty much -just above shoulder length. And if the hairdresser takes a millimetre more off it it’s like the world will end. I have definitely spent more money during the lockdown on beauty products – I guess partly because I’m not going out. But overall, compared with the average woman, I think I’m much less bothered about it. I would rarely spend more than £20 on any one item – in fact the only thing I’ve spent that much on is under-eye concealer. I don’t think a heavily made-up face is particularly attractive – the current make-up trends, with all the contouring and the heavy eyebrows – I think they look pretty grotesque. It’d look ridiculous on me. Now I’m working at home, all I wear makeup wise is some concealer, a little bit of blusher and some mascara. I’d say concealer and mascara are the two things I can’t leave the house without. The only reason I wear make-up when I’m WFH is because of all the video calls. I’ve not worn foundation for a long time. Generally I only wear it for a night out or if I’m going to work in London/at a client’s. The one thing I do love is nail varnish. I don’t often go to a nail-bar – partly because I’ve heard a lot of the people who work in them are trafficked and I don’t want to be part of that. Also because I can’t justify the expense and rarely have the time. I like doing my own nails though and usually go for pretty bright colours. It cheers me to see them. If I was on a desert island, I wouldn’t care about the make-up, as nobody could see me and I wouldn’t have to see the dark circles in the mirror. I have a tendency for dry skin, so I think I’d have to take moisturiser. I used to have short hair when I was at secondary school, then grew it out at uni. It got very long in my twenties but then in my thirties I started to think about cutting it again. Then, after I had my baby I realised I wasn’t going to have time to faff about with hair dryers and straightners, so I got it cut really short. I’ll never go back! I love it short and think it suits my face more. Being mum to a small person, I rarely get much time to get ready if I’m going out for the night (ha! What a dream. None of us have been out for months). So all I do is wash my face. Foundation, eyeshadow, quick eyeliner, bit of blusher then lipstick. I do like a red or bright pink lipstick if I’m going out. I think it can look quite funky with the short hair. Though I’m never sure if I carry it off. What the hell though, I like it."

Since lockdown the only places I have been are work (where I was the only one in my office and the only person who came nearer than 2 metres to me was the cleaner when he suddenly appeared behind me to empty the bin). I had also been to Lidl twice but the social distancing in there was excellent and if I saw anyone coming down the same aisle I moved. As neither my husband nor stepson caught it from me I have wondered if one of them was a carrier. Anyway, my stepson had just been handed back to his mother on Palm Sunday lunchtime, when at about 6pm I started coughing.  This carried on for about an hour and so I looked up the coronavirus symptoms and decided it was definitely a “new continuous cough” and we would need to isolate for 14 days. I asked S to ring his ex-wife as now that she'd taken A back from our flat they would need to isolate for 14 days too. Apparently she just said “Let me know what you want to do about next Sunday” (when we were due to have A back again) and when I said to S that she needed to isolate he said “I can't tell her what to do.” Within another hour I was all achy and couldn't find a comfortable position to sit in. I didn't want any wine (!!) or supper, and went to bed really early. The next day I was feeling worse – aching all over and incredibly tired, and still coughing. When I rang my team leader I explained about how A had just gone back to his mother and that she should be isolating and shouldn't be coming in to work today, and she said she would let our manager know and they could deal with it if she turned up. (She works in  next door to me).  The rest of that first week I felt absolutely awful. My husband continued to watch his car programmes and even went and got himself some lunch without asking if I wanted any!  (I didn't, which he later said he knew and that's why he didn't ask). I felt really unloved but it turned out later that was because he was worried he'd lose me! He insisted on going out every afternoon to look at the sea for his exercise. He has never been so keen on exercise since this lockdown! I didn't even feel like reading, which shows how ill I was. I just watched films – we went through a phase of ridiculous disaster films from the SyFy and Horror channels – 3 Headed Shark, 5 Headed Shark, various Apocalyptic/Doom titles. Some were so bad they were good, some were actually quite watchable and some were laughable, if I'd been in a laughing mood. I slept an awful lot. On Maundy Thursday, while watching an online church service, my cough got so bad I could feel it hurting my throat, and I started to worry my breathing would be affected and I'd have to go to hospital, but when I woke up on Good Friday the cough had got a lot better.  Through all this, I had such a strong sense that God was looking after me, and I was so grateful that S wasn't ill, although he was upsetting me with his apparent indifference. Luckily, his younger son T did a massive shop for us on the Saturday, as we had almost run out of everything. S's main concern was wine, and I think T went to 3 different places to get him stocked up for the next week until he could go out again. (It was a good job for S that I hadn't wanted to drink or eat anything much, or we would have run out sooner. S had tried to get an online shop, but there was nothing at any of 6 supermarkets for the next 3 weeks!) T came back on Easter Monday with a copy of the Times and a bottle of brandy for S's 70th birthday. T didn't come in either time – he stood at the bottom of the first lot of stairs and they talked outside. I was feeling a lot better by that day, and I did manage to eat some dinner and have some wine for the first time in over a week. I had thought about getting someone from work to deliver all the things I'd need so I could work from home, but on the Tuesday a huge fatigue and depression descended on me, and my team leader said she thought I ought to take the whole week off. I had been craving hob nobs towards the end of the first week, as something plain I could eat, and when it turned out T had bought chocolate ones it made me cry!! I lazed about most of that week, still not wanting to read. Then suddenly, at the end of the week I was watching the old version of “Swallows and Amazons” and I felt happy for the first time in ages. My team leader had found out that I needed to get an isolation note and she'd sent me the link to the NHS website to get it. I had to type in my symptoms and a warning came back saying “Phone 111 now – you have the virus”. Obviously by this point I knew I was on the mend, so I didn't ring anyone but just got the isolation note and sent it to work. My team leader wanted me to stay off longer, but by the Monday I knew I was ready to go back to work. I had been in our flat for 17 days and was sick to death of S's car and salvage programmes! S had been raring to go shopping again – and managed to buy a second pack of chocolate hobnobs instead of the plain ones I wanted! When I arrived at work and saw my desk I was so happy I said “Hello” to it. I had felt very supported by my team leader and managers and it was nice to speak to my colleagues who were working at home and hadn't been told I'd had the virus.  (S's ex-wife had come to work the whole time, and my manager had reported her to her manager but nothing had happened. She had offered to keep A for a 3rd week, so that was a bonus for me). I have gone through many emotions since lockdown – firstly I was cross because of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister closing all the churches. They weren't closed in the plague or the wars and have such a strong faith I was sure we would have been safe at church as long as we kept to the social distancing rules. People could have been allowed to choose whether or not they wanted to go. I was also deeply sad about my Mum being in lockdown in her care home, with no idea of how long it would be before we could see each other again, or even if we would (although my faith makes me sure that we will). Then, when I was ill, I was so depressed. A kind of euphoria then took over that I had survived the virus (without going to hospital, which is a huge fear for me, and without S catching it, which was an even bigger fear). Now I find I am fearful of coming into contact with other people, even though I am supposedly immune for a time. I have been appalled by the behaviour of some people in the office and today I was in Morrison's as Mum told me she needed some toiletries and I'm the only person who knows exactly what she needs, and I was shocked by so many customers (and some staff) not even trying to do social distancing. I felt like shouting at them, which is not like me at all! It made me feel really tearful, and when I got home I asked S if we could start online shopping because I am frightened of him going in there, but he said it's always all right when he's there. He seems to think I am mad when I get upset by the lack of social distancing, although he promises me he does it. (He refuses to go into isolation because he's had his 70th birthday as none of his health conditions are to do with lungs or breathing and he wasn't 70 when it started! Also that would mean I would have to work at home, and we only have one living room where the table is too high, the chairs are too low, and he wouldn't be able to watch telly or play on the wii with A while I was working. I wouldn't be able to bring my second computer screen home and I don't think I could do my job without it. (I use a lot of spreadsheets with documents/benefit claims on my other screen). I have found great pleasure in talking to some of my church friends – I have gravitated towards them rather than my atheist friends during this crisis – and listening to the birdsong outside, which is really beautiful. The Government I think the Government was too slow in locking everyone down, especially not stopping flights coming in and out and stopping people travelling about unnecessarily (including themselves, as several pages of today's Times talk about!) I know, from talking to people in other areas, and from what I have observed, that not everyone is following the guidelines, and yet Boris Johnson is always banging on about trusting the public to do what is right – I wouldn't trust the public at all! I would welcome police or appointed inspectors coming into my work and fining all the people who don't observe the rules. (S. says they are not rules as they haven't been made law! I have always been the butt of jokes in my family for wanting to abide by rules and not break them and it seems I still am – although my sister, who usually likes to break rules, has been abiding by them very well in East Barnet and gets shocked when she's out with the dog and sees people in crowds). I have no idea what steps they are going to take next, but the loosening of the lockdown has already meant that on the North Norfolk coast we have been inundated with second-home owners piling into our shops and crowding the beaches. S is upset he can't go and sit on his usual bench looking at the sea because so many of them are around. I think Boris Johnson's days are numbered and if he loosens the lockdown much more and the infection rate goes up he will be blamed – although people should take responsibility for themselves and have some common sense. News In the early days it got so depressing with all the figures I didn't want to listen to it every day, when the only thing you can really do is pray about it. (I was inspired when I read about George VI asking for a national day of prayer before the evacuation of Dunkirk, and look what the result was. No one has enough faith to try anything like this – especially with all the churches shut!) We are getting regular updates at work about any changes to guidelines, and S has a newsfeed on his 'phone so tells me anything major. I read the news in the Times every Saturday (we only get it on Saturdays and Bank Holidays for all the crosswords and sudokus). I certainly have no wish to watch the daily broadcast and am at work at that time anyway. I am surprised that a BSL interpreter is not used for the news coverage. I should have thought with all the technology available these days everyone should be able to access all the news they want. Work and home life I am still going into the office. I was so grateful when I found out that it would stay open for the duration as working at home would be a nightmare for me (and S!) Everyone was so terrified in the beginning we all got kitted out to work from home, including me. For the first time in about 6 years I have a telephone headset (far superior to everyone else's as the earmuffs cover my ears and sit properly over my head instead of only halfway up one side). When our 'phones were changed to work via computers I got a headset and training but I never needed to ring anyone as part of my job, so over the years my training was lost, and when I found my headset didn't even work no one cared (especially me, as I have never liked the 'phone).  But now it has opened up a whole new world, as I am missing my colleagues and managers and it is lovely to see one of their faces on my screen and all I have to do is click Accept and I am speaking to them.  It feels like a miracle to me. One of my colleagues still comes in two days a week, which is nice, apart from the fact that she has started bringing a radio in without headphones. Luckily my team leader popped in last Thursday and asked her to turn it off while we tackled a complicated problem, so I hope that might be the end of it. Another team leader has got so fed up with working at home that she has started coming in on the days when my other colleague isn't in (as their desks are next to each other so they couldn't be in at the same time). Someone came and took photos of the offices last week – I think they are trying to work out how many people could come back and still keep the distance. But I don't think many people want to come back now they have got into a routine. One of my friends came back last Monday but was so upset by the lack of Social Distancing in Council Tax that on Tuesday she bundled up all her stuff and went home again.  Luckily, she did report what she had seen (as I had already done a few weeks ago) so it adds weight to what I have said. There are 4 staff in there (including A's mother) and they stand right next to each other, hang over the back of each other's chairs to look at screens, barge past people in the loo or corridor (which is what happened to my friend N last week) and are extremely noisy, as if they are the only people in the building! Elsewhere there's a man who I saw holding a team meeting with 2 colleagues, chairs in a triangle and their knees almost touching! There's a big note in Reception by the signing in book asking us to use our own pens, and yet there are 2 pens sitting on the book which I've seen people use. I am so lucky to be employed by the council and especially to be working in what is deemed to be an “essential service”. I have no worries about pay and I still have structure to my day by going into the office and sitting at my desk in my nice comfy chair. I had been counting down to early retirement, but being off sick with the virus has changed my views – I'm now asking myself whatever was I thinking?!  I didn't realise a) how much I actually love my job and b) how much I love being in the office and c) how fond of most of my colleagues I am and how much I light up if one of them comes in unexpectedly or rings me up. As far as my home life goes, nothing much has changed as S insists on having A every other week. I was terrified the first time we had him here after he had been in his other home (where we know she doesn't abide by the rules) but now that I have survived the virus and S hasn't caught it I don't mind as I think he prefers being here and so I have been making an effort to play on the wii with him and cook him nice meals. (He managed 10 Yorkshire puddings last weekend!) S says that even though A is 23 his autism means he can switch houses regularly and who am I to deprive him of his son?  But if T does go on her 2 week holiday to Greece in June then she will be forced to isolate for 2 weeks when she comes back and we will be having A for 4 weeks – S told her this today when they did the changeover! I have noticed that S goes out even more than he did before. He loves finding things we need in the shops (he found a bag of plain flour in the Co-op on Saturday!) Again, I wish he didn't put himself in danger, but he is a grown man and he says as I am a key worker he is doing his bit! I am grateful he buys 2 Radio Times at our Post Office on a Tuesday and attaches one to my letter I write Mum every week and posts it first class to her – she usually gets it by Friday if her care home sort the post in time! I am getting more time at home as usually I would visit Mum after work every other day and her friend in another care home once a week, and not get home until getting on for 7. We have discovered the quiz show “Tenable” so are watching that every evening with our aperitif! But I am spending more time on the 'phone – I ring Mum every Sunday morning as that seems a good time for the care home to answer, and I ring her friend twice a week and my church friends every fortnight. Technology We have a work WhatsApp group and sometimes I have to turn the volume off if they are all having trouble connecting to the internet and my 'phone keeps beeping! My sister and I keep in touch on WhatsApp and she rings me every week while she's out with the dog if my nephew hasn't gone with her. (They are isolating together as his father's girlfriend has many health issues and my sister lives alone). A couple of my friends have asked me to speak to them on Face Time or Skype but I would hate that. I've never been much of a fan of 'phones anyway and would rather write letters, texts or emails. My sister has learnt very quickly (and while suffering from the virus!) how to teach all her pilates and exercise classes over Zoom. She has never been much good with technology but is now not only teaching all her classes but taking part in friends' classes and making her own videos which she can upload and sell! Because she has no expenses of driving or hiring halls or going to conventions where she spends lots of money on exercise clothes (and because she's not going out socially) she is saving lots of money, and will probably have a bigger profit this year! I am so proud of her as she would have been one of the last people I know to embrace technology – now she leaves me far behind as she has also been taking part in a friend's quizzes over the internet! Shopping and food I've already said about S's shopping habits.  We couldn't have done anonline shop at any point until a week or so ago when I saw we could have got one on for this Friday. Inthe beginning we only had the usual contents of our fridge and cupboards. A friend at work has a husband who is a chef and he had bought a lot of ingredients that were going to waste, so I bought a bag each of rice, pasta, flour and cheese from him.  We already had a 24 pack of loo rolls that S had bought on a normal shop. Wine was the hardest thing to get when some of the supermarkets rationed it to two bottles at a time, but S was very good at finding corner shops that sold 6 at a time and we were ok until I was ill and we were isolating. As I said, my youngest stepson helped us about that. I was appalled to hear one of my colleagues boasting that they had 189 loo rolls spread over their 3 bathrooms, and his mother had upped their normal weekly online shop so that she had 3 a week from different places! He was speaking to me a couple of weeks ago and said he was knocking off early as the latest online shop was due to arrive and he hadn't unpacked the last one! He did say they are now getting shopping for their 90 year old neighbours, who seem to mostly want wine, whisky and ice cream! I have done a bit more cooking – I've made some quiches and have cooked more when A is with us rather than relying on S. S has discovered how to make really excellent fajitas, so we've had them a few times when on our own. (A is “a meat eater” -his own words – and likes good plain food). We are definitely drinking more, which is not good as our wine habits were pretty bad anyway. I keep teling myself that when I have seen Mum again I will just completely stop, as sometimes I feel I'm just drinking to keep S company rather than for the pleasure of it. Entertainment and leisure I am so upset about all the theatres and cinemas being closed.  I am a weekly reader of The Stage, and the news of theatres going into liquidation fills me with horror.  I love our Theatre Royal in Norwich, and can't wait to go back there as soon as it's safe.  I can't bear the thought that we might lose it completely. I have missed 2 shows that I had booked, but luckily something stopped me making my next booking back in February. I've got a week's leave coming up in June and I'm going to take it so I can tackle some of the mess in this flat. We have books piled up everywhere and they need to be put on the shelves and there are so many other things that need cleaning or sorting and I never feel I have time for these jobs. I hear about so many people stuck at home and finding time to do various new things, but because I am still going out to work every day I don't have any chance to tackle our outstanding projects. I didn't feel like reading during my illness but have since read “The Three Musketeers” and have just ordered some books that were missing from my collection – I had the first 6 books of “A Dance to the Music of Time” but hadn't dared start them until I knew I had the last 6 – now I can start! I was also missing book 3 of a Melvyn Bragg series so hadn't dared to read the second (having read the first not knowing there were more). We are lucky as we have so many books in this house and many of them I've been meaning to get to for years! I have been listening to my set of Gilbert and Sullivan in my car as it uplifts me so much on my way to and from work. My other uplifting music is always Al Bowlly or George Formby and Mozart (which I'm listening to while writing this).  I don't want to hear anything depressing. I avoided “Normal People” on telly because my own late teens were not particularly happy and I don't want to be reminded of what I was like at that age!  I love “Killing Eve” and I binge-watched “Quiz on one afternoon when S had gone to look at the sea and fell asleep! We are still watching disaster films – is this because we need to see something worse than this virus? (I would not be a survivor in a disaster film – I would just be killed instantly. Life has been much kinder to me!) I am still watching “Neighbours” and was so upset when it got rationed to 2 episodes a week! Personal hygiene I am washing my hands much more often than before. And using the hand gel at work when I come back from making my tea. All the time I was ill I still forced myself to have a shower and get dressed every day (maybe not until 12ish some days). I have never been a laze around in pyjamas kind of person. I am still wearing my work clothes to work and my home clothes at home. (Our chief executive is wearing tee shirts at work!) I am shocked that S is making shirts last 2 days when he seems to be out more – he says he's not and no one will see him! We both take unironed clothes off the ironing pile (as it saves me work) if we are not going to be seeing anyone except each other! Sleep S has been staying up until 2 in the morning watching telly long after I've gone to bed, because he has been ill since December and had a dreadful rash which was so itchy he couldn't sleep. Thankfully he has got a lot better over the last 3 weeks since having to visit the doctor and getting a different cream at last. I have then had problems with him waking me up at 5 or 6 with his snoring. It's only a problem when I need to get up for work, and he has been better at coming to bed earlier and turning on to the side where he doesn't snore if I ask him nicely! We've both been having weird dreams – he got up from his afternoon rest yesterday saying his jigsaw of a Lancaster had fallen all over the floor. (He doesn't have a jigsaw on the go). I've had really vivid dreams with terror in them – aeroplanes flying at me through my window, people I love in trouble – but this could be because of the disaster films and because my Mum's home now has the virus (she's tested negative and is in her own room alone) and because I have always been a worrier.  I have found I am grinding my teeth a lot – it wakes me up sometimes. My dentist told me a couple of months ago it's a sign of stress and won't help my gums, so I am trying to stop it when I'm awake."

MASS-OBSERVATION - SPRING 2020 DIRECTIVEPart 2:  Covid 19 (Update)As things change so rapidly at present, my writings below are on 27 May 2020.Getting towards the end of lockdown for us 'oldies' my husband of 80 and myself late 70's. Our health is reasonable but due to ages we are classed as vunerable.  I don't think we have experienced much in the way of physical or mental health issues. Of course at times we have become frustrated at not being able to participate in our 'usual way of life' My husband is less sociable than I am buthe does miss being able to get a daily newspaper, and help as a volunteer at a	local steam railway.We have quite a large garden which we have both been working in probably more than usual, and so many gardens in our neighbourhood are far more immaculate than previously.I miss my Ladies circle meetings, Mother's Union gatherings, volunteering in local hospice shop, church services and helping at church events like our summer gala, welcoming visitors to Bristol Cathedral. I do takea walk around the village most days and have got to know all the dog walkers as we have a chat - the poor dogs look at you as if to say do stroke me, but of course I  cannot.I have received over 50 telephone calls, and have of course telephoned many relatives/friends. I read a lot and our local library has a 'drop off' service which is great. You can tell the librarian what 'type' of book you enjoy and up to 6 will be delivered to your door. You have to leave them in the package 72 hours before opening, but it is a joy to have plenty to read. I do jig-saws, craft work as I belong to a craft group and was making a small rug when lockdown commenced I completed thisand have begun another small rug, from a kit, with cats and mice on. The poetry group to which I belong is still meeting on-line - one of our members is brilliant on a computer.Our family, one son living nearby, and a daughter in Hertfordshire, have been so good. Our daughter does our shopping on-line and we have had excellent deliveries from Morrisons, ASDA,Iceland and Tesco. Our son brings some items when he shops for himself and family a short driveaway. We meet the family regularly on Zoom, it is wonderful to see and talk to our two grandchildren. We even had an 8 families gathering on Zoom when we celebrated my husband's birthday recently.Our church is good	- holding a service online every Sunday, and socials/quiz during the week, and keeping us up-to-date with the local/wider church community.Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I was on a bus with friends three weeks before lockdown and all the talk was about the virus, and what was the Government doing as we heard of other countries and how they were coping. I think lockdown should have been earlier but as I said hindsight is awonderful thing. I trust the Government will now make finding a vaccine, good testing the main priority. I have watched most of the daily 5pm bulletins , at times as we heard of the high numbers of deaths and those with Covid 19 it was quite harrowing but we had to know the facts and2generally I think the medical people explained things in a clear, understandable way. I don't know anyone who has experienced challenges with the news, although being quite a deaf person I have wished we had sign language people like in the Scottish and Irish news bulletins.Having worked in a large hospital for many years prior to retirement personal hygiene has always been a priority, but I think I have washed my hands more often than usual, cleaned things like alldoor handles, surfaces, window openers, a little more often than usual. I wear gloves As far as possible food items delivered, prior to putting them away.and cleanI haven't experienced sleep problems, but I do keep occupied, even if  in a different way. I generally watch some television in the evenings, and read once in bed, and soon feel sleepy. I am sure some folk, maybe those living in high-rise flats with children not at school and no-where to get rid of energy, will be finding sleep problems, also those key workers when coming off duty may find it difficult to sleep when seeing such sad patients, unable to have relatives and friends visit them, their daily experiences could 'remain on their minds' as they try and rest. Also many people will be worried about the loss of their jobs, illness, paying the rent, mortgage, enough food, all could mean difficulty in sleeping.  I have not strictly answered under each of your prompt headings but have tried to give a picture of my, my husband's months in lockdown."

It has been frustrating at times but there has been no choice. I was locked down from March 14th in Murcia Spain and it was difficult to return to the UK with our car and our dog as ferries weren’t running. Here’s a diary of this time 13.3.20 I am spending three months in the Murcia region of Spain with my husband. We have been watching the news about the threat of Covid-19 in U.K. and Spain but there has not been a sense of emergency about the spread to either country although we are distressed to see how Italy is badly hit by the virus. My cousin is arriving on a flight from the Newcastle UK to stay with us for a week and my sister and her husband are arriving on a flight from London later this evening. We plan a week of visiting local historic sights and beauty spots mixed with good food and meeting friends who live here. 21.00 As we are eating with my cousin in a local restaurant, we are told there will be a lockdown from midnight. This is the first we and our local friends have heard of the arrangement. My other two guests arrive to find out about the lockdown and we have a few days with three guests where we aren’t allowed out of the villa except for food shopping or medical reasons. Only one person is allowed out to shop and only to the local shop. We have our dog with us so one person can walk him with 50 metres of the villa. We are lucky to be in an enclosed villa with terraces and a pool because we are confined here with our guests for the foreseeable future. We enjoy outdoor lunches, reading by the pool and board games are pulled out at night. It’s years since we all played “trivial pursuit” and our general knowledge seems no better. 15th March -After a day or two, holiday makers are advised to return home as soon as possible and our guests leave early in fear of their previous flights being cancelled. My husband and I are on lockdown for longer because we have the car, the dog, the golf clubs and three months of holiday stuff to pack into the car to get theferry and our ferry can’t be changed. 20th March -24th April. We live in lockdown for weeks and our ferry at the end of April is cancelled. We manage to book another for the end of May and extend the rental of the villa for another month. 25th April – May We both feel safer in our little bubble of Spain with its strict lockdown rules than in the U.K. where the virus is spreading and the PM is desperately ill too. The U.K. guidelines were put in place two weeks after Spain’s lockdown and, to us, they seem lax. In Spanish shops there are 2 metre distancing markers, masks and gloves and sanitiser and there is a limit on certain items so there is not a shortage. On the news and from friends we see the U.K. is running out of toilet rolls of all things and hand wash. Didn’t we all wash our hands before this? People are stockpiling and U.K. shops are allowing it. We hear the key health workers get to the shops and they’re empty. Every evening at 8 there is music played and clapping from the roof terraces around is for the key workers in the crisis. There are not many people around us as they are mainly second homes and nobody can travel but we hear the music and applause from nearby streets and don’t feel alone. I come to Spain every February to write and enjoy warmer weather than in the U.K. but I find for the first four weeks that Ican’t settle to it. The world seems to have turned upside down and we listen to news for hours just waiting to hear something positive. Eventually we accept that this isn’t going away anytime soon and I start writing again. I write more than normal and finish my current book edits and write a novella too. The novella is about a diphtheria epidemic in a few Northern villages during the winter of 1944 and I empathise with the fear and helplessness of my characters as their children go to an isolation hospital. I discover through my research, that the ‘strangling angel’ of diphtheria was a real threat during the war years and killed more children than German bombs. The vaccine was eventually rolled out in the U.K. so by the end of the 40s this threat had been eradicated. I find myself wondering how long it will take to creat a vaccine for covid-19. My husband is 72 and I’m 68 so we both need medication and we are aware that our travel insurance has run out so it is a worrying time. The travel insurance people agree to extend cover for us and our car but we both need to access medication. Luckily, the local pharmacy orders our tablets without a prescription just on sight of the tablet boxes and we can pay for them ourselves. My tablets are aromatise inhibitors to deter cancer from reoccurring and we pay €92 for a month’s supply but feel grateful we have what we need and relax more about our extended Spanish lockdown. That is until we hear that our ferry has been cancelled for a second time. We decide that we cannot risk another booking and plan our route back through France and the channel tunnel. 11th May -Soon after the lockdown is partially lifted on 11th May, we make our minds up to leave and set off for home on 18th May. We must travel through Spain and France making three overnight stops and we are nervous at the thought of the journey but we want to get back to our own home and nearer to our children and grandchildren. We leave armed with masks, antibacterial wipes, our own sandwiches and a great deal of trepidation. We have 1600 miles to cover over four days before we reach our own front door and all three countries have suffered from the virus so nowhere seems safe. When we arrive home we will self isolate for 14 days and wait to see if we have managed to stay clear of the virus. 22.5.20 Home at last . 5.6.20 Our self imposed quarantine is over but we still can’t see our children or grandchildren. Thank goodness for technology. Govt. They’ve made mistakes but this is a new state of emergency and some of their actions have been excellent. Furlough pay, loans to businesses etc -good. PPE equipment -dire I think the govt is desperate to get the country back to work and the schools open but they have done an excellent job in scaring people into staying home. NEWS – I listen to the daily briefing from the govt. I take their data and latest updates with a pinch of salt. We didn’t know how ill the PM was until later. The Dominic Cummings debacle and the Prof Neil Ferguson breach of his own rules has been depressing. I listen to some BBC and SKY news. I ignore social media because there is always some sort of scare story circulating. BSL interpreters are the best response NS has made. We should have all acted as one nation for lockdown lifting and she has her own agenda. I’m retired from education but I write and do this at home. I’ve written more. Technology I’ve taken exercise classes with my own instructor in real time via zoom. Iaccessed classes in Spain so I had more access than if she had been teaching in my gym. I like not having to drive to a class. Time saving! I’ve spoken to friends and family regularly usingwhatsapp and facetime. I use facebook, twitter and instagram a lot already to promote my novels but ive been on it more. Shopping and Food We shopped in maskes in Spain and followed social distancing In UK we’ve used click and collect to miss out on the shhop exposure. I’ve bought clothes, toiletries and Books online We have started a HelloFresh delivery where the ingredients of three fresh meals are packaged with the recipe and delivered weekly. This is because I was bored with cooking the same old stuff and we get more variety. We used to eat out two or three times in the week. We haven’t used takeaways at all because im not sure how safe that is. Personal Hygeine We have both kept to the same routines. We dress and don’t have pyjama days like my grandkids do. We have both grown our hair over five months (no choice)and my husband has grown a beard but trims it. we havent gone feral. Sleep Terrible at first -Sleepless nights, weird dreams then exhausted and an early night but waking up at 3. I’d just get up and write. My worst vivid dream was that I’d told everyone Iwas fed up with living and I wanted to die. They all agreed and we went on a jaunt in a convoy of old cars to a dignitas place. I was in the car with my current and my ex husband and both were happy with my choice. I kept saying should I do it? and they both said yes you’ve had a good life. Myfriends and family came along in the cars for a sort of a wake rather than a funeral and a party was going on. I couldn’t tell them I’d changed my mind. Nobodywould listen. We were in a strange old house with no locks and I was frightened of sleeping in case I was injected. Iwoke up and didn’t want to go back to sleep in case it started again. I felt unwanted, invisible and surplus to requirements. Since we got to UK we have both slept much better. Relief at being home I tihnk."

This is part of my anatomy I had hoped he would never have to see: the inside of somebody’s mouth is rarely a pretty sight. Wednesday July 15  Dentist reopened but not for any aerosol work, so I didn’t make an appointment. Tooth doesn’t hurt and I don’t want to have it exytracted;  I’d rather wait and see if we can save it.  Tuesday Feb 18  At last an appointment at the local hospital ENT department to remove earwax, which the practice nurse can no longer do. Very thankful for the appointment , where they “hoover” your ears, as I have been deaf since before Christmas.  Very apprehensive in the waiting room, which was crowded:  becoming aware that close contact with people is not ideal.  Friday March 13  Husband and I started taking our temperatures every day, as one of the signs of Covid 19 is a raised temperature. Saturday 25 July  News bulletins full of advice about obesity and how it is detrimental to health(no surprise there, then) and seems to be a factor in Covid 19 complications and deaths. Husband and I worked out our Body Mass Index - both happilyin the middle of the “normal” range. Thursday March 5  Started to go in and out of our front door instead of the back door, so that it’s easier to go straight into the cloakroom and wash our hands the minute we enter the house  Monday March 16  Daughter K phoned, tearful at the prospect of being stuck in the house for ever with her two-year old and small baby. Friday March 20 Reports herself “a bit emotional” Monday May 4  K was prescribed with anti-depressants to help her cope  Thursday March 19Sunday April 5  Daughter A reports herself “philosophical and positive”A reports her 9 year old daughter “moody and fearful”  Daughter J  Thursday March 19  Husband went to a blood donation session but didn’t stay as they all had to queue up in a small anteroom close together.  Monday March 23  Diary entry: “This feels like the start of a very long war, and all our instincts tell us to do what we can’t now do (getting together, meeting to pray etc).  I was dismayed at the thought of no weddings, and funerals to be attended only byimmediate family. Thursday March 26  Really concerned about this funeral business.  Decided to update our funeralplans in case none of the family can attend; sent them a document containing all our passwords, and reminders of where all our papers are, in the event of our deaths with none of them here, or with no time to tell them.  Friday March 27  Upset all day at the thought of not being at the bedside of a dying loved one;9 years ago this week since my mother died, and 3 years ago next week sincemy mother-in-law died.  Both of them were frail and in care homes, and were on “end-of-life” care for several days before they died, so we had enough time to hold their hands, tell them everything we’d meant to say before, sing to them and talk to them about the old days. The experience had been asgood as it could be, and it’s awful to think that not everyone can have that experience because of Covid 19. Friday April 10  Distressed at seeing mass graves in New York, and a .eld hospital in Central Park.  Tuesday April 7  Feeling guilty at secretly enjoying the freedom and “holiday feeling” of lockdown, when so many others are hard-pressed and distressed. Tuesday April 21  Diary entry: “Who will I be when this is over? Needing to rethink all social contact?!”  Wednesday May 13  Diary entry:”The .rst time I’ve felt miserable”. Felt tetchy and low all week, asthe realisation set in that this situation could go on and on. Monday 18 May Diary entry: “Concerned about sliding into unthinking torpor” Tuesday 19 May  Ridiculously thrilled to be in the church hall, tidying things up, emptying bins etc - all the tasks that would normally be a chore. Monday June 15  Decided on a “shake things up, make some plans” week. Husband and I decided that we would make scarecrows for the annual village competition;  we won last year and had previously decided not to do one this year so we didn’t feed our competitive spirit. Thursday 23 July  Loved this quote from the .lm “Marvellous”, watched this evening, starring Toby Jones and telling the story of Neil Baldwin of Stoke-on-Trent:  “I wanted to be happy, so I decided to be.”  Tuesday March 24  Husband’s hernia operation, scheduled for March 31st, postponed;  theyphoned. He was going to postpone anyway as he felt it not to be su.ciently urgent. Tuesday August 4  Hospital phoned: hernia op scheduled for August 20.  Need to self-isolate for a long fortnight beforehand, so immediately.  Decided to self-isolate together.  Rethought plans for shopping and meeting family.  Husband will be tested for Covid-19 at the hospital on August 8th, get the result on 19th and, if all is well, go in for day surgery on 20th.  Saturday April 18  A bout of cystitis; phoned NHS 111 and was amazed at swift and helpfulresponse when they must be so busy.  The extensive question-and-answersession about possible Covid 19 symptoms took longer than the rest of the phone consultation; prescription quickly sent through to local pharmacist and Husband picked up the meds later in the day.  Friday May 29  Phone appointment with locum GP about recurrent dizzy spells:  she thoughtit was probably BPPV, a sort of vertigo which is helped by a GP performing the Epley manoeuvre which is apparently some sort of head-waggling.  It’ll obviously have to wait until we can have hands-on consultations!  Tuesday June 16  News of friend E (93) in a care home:  no visitors for months, until she declined so rapidly that she was put on “end of life” care and her daughter was allowed in for daily visits. She perked up so much that she is now backto her old self, so her daughter isn’t allowed to visit!  Wednesday June 17  Friend M back on medication for anxiety and panic attacks  Tuesday June 2Thursday June 25Tuesday July 14Friday July 31Saturday August 1  Swam in the sea - chilly but lovely!  Thursday June 18  Had to measure Husband’s legs for new surgical stockings, a job the practice nurse would normally do  Personal hygiene Entertainment and leisure Saturday March 14  Decided to cancel eyebrow-waxing appointment with K at her salon, as she’d just returned from holiday in Spain where Covid 19 was rife.I have actually managed to pluck my eyebrows as much as is necessary; having discovered that grey/white hairs don’t show much,  I probably won’t go back to the salon at all, thus saving £8 every 4 weeks  Thursday March 19  Husband bought hair trimmers from Sainsbury’s:  a No. 8 leaves you with25mm of hair all over, which is not far di.erent from the short spiky style I have anyway. Wednesday April 8  Husband cut my hair, some with scissors and the rest with the trimmer.  Very impressed with the result - posted it so hairdresser could see it.  She was impressed too! Tuesday June 16  Husband cut my hair again; we’ve decided that nude hairdressing is the thing, so the bits of hair don’t stick in our clothes. Monday June 29 Nude hairdressing for both of us. Saturday July 11 More nude hairdressing. Tuesday July 21  Our hairdresser reopened for business, with appropriate precautions.  We didn’t feel the need to rush for appointments, as we were managing perfectly well by ourselves. I probably wouldn’t go back at all except I like the girl and want to give her the business.  Monday March 23  Beauty salon owner brought round ordered supplies of cosmetics and sun cream;  £238 well spent, I hope.  Saturday March 14and fortnightly thereafter  Repainted toenails multicoloured, like I always do, all year round. Repainted .nger nails.  Friday March 20 and daily thereafter  Started a daily walk for about an hour (much more than usual, just because we have previously been busy going to other places and doing other things)  Tuesday March 17 and daily thereafter  Making the most of having every evening together, decided to play 2 games of Scrabble which takes about an hour altogether.  Vastly improved our scores and vocabulary over time.  Wednesday March 18 and thereafter  Started listening to “The daily service”, on BBC Sounds, at lunchtime onweekdays: not much to talk about with Husband when we’ve been togetherall morning!  Friday August 7 Tuesday August 11  Signed up for Oxford Centre for Life-Writing’s “Life-writing for immeasurable events” Submitted .rst piece of writing. A good brain-exercise and the tasks are very varied (as well as being optional).  It has been a joy to have more time to do the things I’ve always done in a more hurried manner: cooking, baking, letter-writing.  I wrote longer letters, more frequently, to the family, often including pictures, or poems I’d read. Started reading poetry on the loo every morning. Watched primary school choir rehearsals, taken by Daughter A, on Vimeo. Carried on listening to “The Archers”; after the .nal pre-recorded episode on Friday 1 May, special lockdown episodes started, just Mon-Thurs each week, on Monday May 25. What else did I listen to? No real change from usual routine: Radio 4 Today Programme 0600-0900; PM 1700-1800, the Six o’clock news 1800-1830, The world tonight 2200-2245. Watched more TV than usual, because we were in every evening. Watched usually for an hour, a programme we’d previously recorded.  Caught up on things we’d had recorded for months: the Royal Institution Christmas lectures; documentaries about the workings of supermarkets; feature .lms; “Elizabeth is missing” starring the incomparable Glenda Jackson, who won a BAFTA for her performance of an elderly woman with Alzheimer’s (like my Mum)Enjoyed reruns of historical documentaries: Mary Beard on everyday life in Rome; Lucy Worsley on everything Tudor and victorian; Andrew Marr on post-war Britain; Michael Wood on the history of Kibworth, Leics, through the ages.Made the most of the Wimbledon fortnight with the BBC coverage of past matches.Alan Bennett’s Talking heads monologues, with new actors recreating the 1980s classics.Got into more detective series: Cardinal, set in Canada; Van Der Valk, set in the Netherlands; Wisting, set in Norway.Had time to immerse ourselves in drama series: Wolf Hall (repeat); Twin; Mrs America; Hidden; The nest; Flesh and blood; Devs; State of happiness; Line of duty Still waiting for an invitation to the neighbour’s hot tub, which is under a gazebo in the garden, festooned with fairy lights! Technology Wednesday March 18  Managed to get this Zoom thing working, having a conversation with H and M in the morning.In evening, had a Zoom call with all three daughters and oldest grandchild, laughing until we cried (with relief and joy?) at antics of granddaughter who knew how to change backgrounds, put up silly photos etc.  Sunday March 22  Husband ran his Bible Study group on Zoom 0900, having helped a couple of members (by phone) to set it up.1100 and 1900 Our .rst Church services on Zoom and Facebook.  Sunday March 22 Friday July 17  Started daily Zoom calls with all three daughters and their children, at 1630 for half an hour. Mutual decision to limit Zoom calls to weekdays, as the family are out and about more now at weekends  Wednesday March 25  Started running Bible Study group on Zoom:  8 out of 10 members happy towork that way.  It has been running weekly ever since, with me updating theother 2 by email after each session.  Monday April 6  Friend J (81) phoned to say she is learning new things on her tablet every day!  Monday April 13  Family quiz on Zoom in evening.  Thursday May 7 andFriday May 8  Joined new Facebook group with cousins to share memories and photos of our parents, who were 19 siblings  Friday May 29  Registered for online banking;  too slow to wait for them to answer the phones these days (20 minutes).  Wednesday June 3 and Thursday June 4  Enjoyed watching a few Aberdeen Festival of Music classes entered by our grandchildren, all entries being recorded then played to the audience on Zoom, with live adjudication  Saturday June 13  Daughter A put on a live Facebook concert of songs from the shows, with husband I as piano accompanist; part of a series.  Thursday July 9 andfortnightly thereafter  Our .rst Messy Church session on released on Facebook, Husband having learned how to use i-movie in order to make videos to upload to Facebook.  Friday July 17  Husband learned how to use GarageBand to upload songs for use in church services online, and how to make multi-track recordings of his singing  Friday August 7  Family concert on Zoom, organised by granddaughter A (11).  We all performed - instruments, dance, recitation, songs - including a video of grandchildren F and E (two and a half, nine months old) jingling bells while daughter K sang “Jingle bells”. Granddaughters A and L (11 and 9, living inBirmingham and Aberdeen) had choreographed and rehearsed a dance routine via Zoom.  Sleep No change in sleep patterns or dreaming, although I was waking earlier than usual during most of March, mulling over what was happening in the world. This is not helped by the fact that, to detract from tinnitus, I keep the bedside radio on all night, on BBC Radio 4/World Service. Shopping and food Monday March 16  Feeling that the world was about to close in on us, Husband and I had a tripinto town to look at lightweight vacuum cleaners in Curry’s;  I stocked up withtoiletries at Boots and Superdrug, and bought some costume jewellery (earrings) in Next.  Monday March 16  Visited the new Foodbank premises and took in some boxes of donations from our church.  Impressed to see they now have fridges and freezers so can stock a wider variety of food.  Thursday March 19  Husband to Sainsbury’s for weekly food shop.  Bought hair trimmers for DIYstyling.  Friday March 20  News bulletins all about panic buying of toilet rolls, pasta, .our…. and supermarkets setting aside special hours or days for di.erent special groups of customers to shop. Some rationing of supplies to ensure enough for everybody.  None of this a.ected us directly.  In truth, it’s quite exciting and makes you feel as though you’re playing at being in WW2;  we have plenty offood and supplies generally, and can easily manage with alternatives to the items in short supply.  Wednesday March 25  Much discussion, in our Zoom Bible Study group, about shortages, where to get sanitiser etc. Dismay that Boots aren’t letting you browse around the shop for toiletries or makeup.  Thursday March 26  Diary entry: “[Husband] to supermarket. He found no queues, and enough stu. on the shelves; bought treats for Aldi and Sainsbury’s sta. and, this afternoon, for chemist and Co-op sta. in Kinghorn” as a thank-you for all their extra work, and to compensate for all the abuse received from frantic customers  Monday April 6  Ventured to our local Post o.ce and chemist: limited customer access, with chalk marks on the pavement outside to space out queues; the chemist on restricted hours, and only admitting one customer at a time, with a one-way system around the shop, and a screen at the till.  Quite nerve-racking, tryingto think about every move you make.  Thursday May 21  Husband managed to buy two packs of vinyl gloves, some dried yeast AND 2bags of granary bread .our, none of which had been in stock for at least 2 months.  Tuesday June 30 Tuesday July 21  Ventured into Kirkcaldy, our nearest town.  Hardly anyone around in the high street or the shops.  Ventured into Holland & Barrett;  wore a mask for the .rst time. Second visit to Kirkcaldy; not so nerve-racking as all the shops andassistants are used to the new routines now.  Used contactless credit card payment for the .rst time. We have bought Safeky devices so we don’t have to touch door-handles or press buttons with our hands.  Friday July 11  Heard that L is to rent the empty shop unit in the high street, as a warehouse for her newly opened business in the next town, where she supplies goods in bulk, and customers take their own containers to .ll them. She started the business in November 2019 and has been busier than ever since lockdown started.  Saturday July 18  Used a cafe for the .rst time in months. Husband went in to order and collect, and we sat outside.  Tuesday August 4  Registered for Sainsbury’s online shopping as we have to self-isolate for two weeks before Husband’s op;  shopping this way is relatively easy and painless, so we might carry on like this for a while.  News I seemed to be glued to news bulletins even more than usual during the early weeks of the crisis, because events were moving so quickly both in UK and around the world. BBC Radio 4 programmes in the morning until 0900, then again at teatime 1700-1830, then at bedtime 2200 onwards;  BBC News channel on TV at 1300 and 1600. We started watching the live 1700 daily brie.ngs from London and did so for about a month, then there wasn’t so much day-to-day change . I’m afraid I started to think, “Oh, there can’t be much to say today” when a less senior member of government was put up as the main spokesperson. Questions from the assembled press, who were in the brie.ng room at the start, were pertinent; some of the repetition in the screened questions, and the standard answers, later on was tedious. We also sometimes watched the daily brie.ngs in Scotland; I think the sign language interpreter adds to the experience. I don’t know anyone personally who has had di.culty accessing information. Husband used information from BBC website to make his own graphs of infections and deaths in UK and in Scotland (and is still doing so August 2020)Husband signed up for The Times daily coronavirus update by email (and is still doing so August 2020) I make brief notes in my diary about major news stories of the day, so can trace the spread of the virus and concomitant interest, changing into alarm, developing into panic, leading to political action. The government Wednesday Jan 22  First diary mention of Covid-19:”Coronavirus spreads in China”  Friday January 31  Diary entry:”UK leaves EU 2300.

All about Italy: what should we do here?”  Wednesday March 11  Diary: “Budget Day.  Coronavirus now a WHO pandemic.  DTrump stops all .ights from Europe, but not from UK.”  Thursday March 12  Diary: “Watched PM, Chief Medical O.cer and Chief Scienti.c Something-or-Other give press conference after COBRA meeting.  Ireland, France, Spain etc. close schools.

To begin with lockdown was a relief in many ways – everyone was in the same boat, all the bits of me that tell me what I should be doing fellsilent as I couldn’t doany of them. As a single olderwomanI felt more in the swim of things than I usually do and that was nice. I live in a small group of houses and we would see each other for socially distanced cups of tea sometimes. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Oh please! It has been a complete shambles! Every decision has been taken weeks after it should have been, the people in charge are so inexperienced and they look like frightened rabbits most of the time. I have no confidence that anyone really knows what they are doing. We have to wear masks in shops from Friday. This all started in March, why now for goodness sake? And it doesn’t improve – there is no sense of shame. Things go wrong, like going into lockdown too late, but nothing changes. We implement quarantine rules for people arriving in the country in June, when we should have done it in February. The logic is largely absent in these decisions and frankly I feel very insecure. Most people are make their own rules, based on their own judgment and assessment of risk. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? God knows. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I watched C4 news for the first few weeks, and got headlines from the daily guardian email. I’ve also kept up with world statistics through a website. I haven’t watched the news forseveralweeks now and if I stumble across a radio interview with a minister I usually have to switch off, it’s so excruciating. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I did to begin with and it felt like a group of six formers were telling us what to do, people who looked completely out of their depth, including our prime minister. I stopped watching after a couple of weeks and just picked up the headlines afterwards. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I think BSL interpreters should be used. Or text perhaps. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I am a psychotherapist and I have continued my work online. I am used to doing this anyway so the impact has been minimal. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I did feel frightened to start with, being on my own and not seeing anyone. I continued to see one of my daughters, who lives locally and also lives alone. It felt that was ok because we weren’t connecting with anyone more than someone who lived with another. My other daughter came to stay for a month during May, which was lovely. I did tell her that I would like her to come. There was a sense of guilt I remember, about being safe at home whilst others put their lives in danger and were under terrible stress, and about having a safe income whilst others were losing theirs. I wrote this in my journal about a month into lockdown: ‘Some days, Imay be walking across the heath, or pottering at home, a sense of enormity comes over me. When the pandemic first started here, and organisations started to send people home to work, many of us stopped going to pubs and restaurants and shops, and then the official lockdown began on the 22 March 2020,mymindcouldn’ttakeitin.Ichangedmybehaviourradically,asdidmostothers,butsomehowIcouldn’t getmyhead roundit.That went onformaybethree orfourweeks, andgraduallyI startedtoadjust.’ I wrote this poem around May, several weeks into lockdown. Bewildered It is ok not to be ok, he says, as we berate ourselves for our good fortune. It’sall good,she says everything’sfine, andher eyesfill with achild’stears. The sun shines like summer, day after endless day, while they build porta-morgues in car parks, jump onpatients’ chestsin ICU, nurses cry and doctors set their jaws. We are good girls and boys, staying at home, keeping our distance, wearing our gloves and masks. We stand back on narrow paths and smile at each other. We know the drill. These others have toed the line as well, but now they go by train to cramped workplaces where two metres are the fabric of dreams My young neighbour predicts the weather for energy traders and is buying a three million pound house down the road, while I keep paying into the food bank, also down the road. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I was lucky to be used to connecting with people online and used to zoom, skype, facetime etc. I did join an evening class which was on outlook Teams, and it was so awful I withdrew from the course. But on the whole I’ve been fine. I have noticed quite a lot of people my age struggling though, having to update their laptops, struggling with understanding how to use the technology. I have a client who has never managed to sort hers and we now meet outside and go for a socially-distanced walk instead. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I’ve found that people have got in touch who I haven’t heard from for some time. It is as though we have more space to think and to consider who and what we value in life. I have also dated online! I quite liked it as it is easier and so reduces the pressure of initial dates. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I rarely use these at any time and this has not changed during lockdown. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? To begin with I didn’t want to go into shops, and it was more or less impossible to get groceries online or delivered for quite some time. So neighbours and friends cooperated with each other, if I managed to get a click and collect shop I would get things for others and vice versa. I also started to order meals from Hello Fresh, a company that delivers the wherewithal to cook meals – the recipes and ingredients all arrive in a box on your doorstep. That has been really useful for a while. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I’ve been doing quite a lot of online classes, most of which I was already doing in person. Yoga, watercolours and poetry writing. I also have meetings with my spiritual group and have done a whole week’s retreat online in April. It worked fine. In fact I rather liked being at home and the autonomy it gave me. I could turn my video off and go and make a cup of tea while still listening! I could mute people I didn’t want to listen to. A whole new world. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Probalby has not changed, but I do notice I’m less concerned about how I look and how I dress. I just can’t be bothered, and when I did some online dating it felt like a real stretch to think of something nice to wear. And then another outfit for the next date! Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Yes I had a lot of strange dreams to start with, but these eased after a few weeks and I sleep fine now.

I’m working from home and the work PC is on an old computer desk so giving me a 2foot space to work in. I’m find the day to day routine samey and very tiring. Others on the street were furloughed and spent their time gardening leaving mine looking dreadful in comparison (it was never going to win awards anyway). I get nearly weekly briefings from the office manager as conference calls. Notably last week was mental health week and we didn’t get a briefing – which is quite ironic. I have thought more about mortality and the loss of my parents. This sometimes affects me but I try to move on as there’s little I can do about anything. It doesn’t help that I’m totally alone here and often the only other face I see is my own reflection in the bathroom mirror. I’m very conscious of mindfulness. I responded to an artist friend online who was finding the day to day existence troubling. I replied that initially we all tried to maintain a form of normality but as time went by the ‘new normal’ takes over. It all becomes very beige and timeless (especially if you’re by yourself). So in order to be conscious of the moment and less inside your head we need to do small things in order to experience the present more. Little things like consciously noticing the texture of the chair as I raise or lower myself helps to focus the mind to the present. The Government I think it is easy to demonise people and I’m conscious that the Government gets criticism that’s underserved along with some that isn’t. I do believe that there was indecision at the start but from then on they’ve tried their best in the face of ever changing advice. Some of the plans take time to gestate but it is obvious to me that there has been a lot of thought gone into moving the population in the new future. Not everything will work out but all angles are being covered just in case (and we would complain if they weren’t). Some will argue that we are not being told but I believe we are being slowly manoeuvred because the population at large is unable to process more than one message at a time (there is a lot of stupid people out there). This coupled with the way the initial instruction was hammered home means there is a reluctance by some to move forward. We were asked to stay at home to ‘flatten the curve’; not to hide away forever. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I used to watch the daily briefings but I now just get the headlines from the BBC (preferably the Red Button service) or from other news services via YouTube. From the very start this was obviously going to take a year at least and any prediction of otherwise was based on an unsubstantiated hope and it didn’t take long before desperation for a news story by the media resulted in the reporting becoming a game of finding an ‘angle’ in which to spread despair. So instead of imparting information without bias it became criticism and rumour. One incident I did find annoying, we had “top” political journalists (Robert Preston and Laura Kuenssberg) asking questions they knew could not be answered due to the ministerial code. But because they wanted the headline they went and asked them. So they decided NOT to ask useful questions about the governments’ approach to the virus or anything constructive and insightful. I cannot recall the order of the questioners but even more criticism should be aimed at who asked second after learning that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. The act of repeating the same question/approach demonstrated that they wanted glory and a possible award nomination later. As for the BSL interpreter. I acknowledge that this group of people need to have access to the news but I suspect that the inclusion of one will slow the proceedings of the Q&A and raises accuracy issues from live signing. A BSL overlay is on the BBC News feed and on the BBC YouTube channel and is uploaded directly afterwards. There are also written reports online and the RED Button service (whose termination of service was postponed) does by nature provide written content. The inclusion of a BSL interpreter by Nicola Sturgeon is no surprise as it became obvious that she was playing a media game. All accessibility angles are covered and by also having her press conferences earlier than the daily one allowed her to reveal the contents of the COBRA meeting she was part of first. Work and home life Our office was disbanded to work from home and I’ve been doing this the 24th March. Some of the testing and construction staff have been furloughed. Since I work in a design office we are able to operate outside of the office but it has made things very awkward. We have to book a time slot to enter the office to collect any printing which thanks to our network security requires you to physically enter to present your ID to the printer. The Network speed has been volatile and it took a while to get the headsets for Skype meetings to work properly (and not everyone has been successful). I’m now working in a 2foot wide space and use the stairs as a filing system with paperwork all over the floor. There is now no separation between home and work as the PC and other materials are in the living room with me. My partner has been asked to shield and since the house is small she has gone to her parents were they have plenty of space. As a consequence I’m all alone here and it is lonely. Initially it felt like she was in another room but now it simply feels empty. Anything I put down never moves making everything seem frozen. A sort of timelessness invades everywhere. I had hoped to do something more for myself as I’m allegedly gaining by working from home. Instead I’m spending longer on the work PC due to its lack of speed and an unspoken pressure of being ‘seen’ to be online. I’ve now consciously decided to scale this back and I’m only recording (not claiming) an additional ½ ­1 hour extra a day. Mostly because I feel that any of my efforts are not being appreciated and I have noted snide remarks by a work colleague who wants to raise their profile. Since I’m working on his scheme I’m not going out of my anymore to accommodate him. No extra books have been read or any useful DIY jobs undertaken. I do have a boiler service due that will necessitate the rearrangement of the stuff brought from work – the joy never ends… Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I use Facebook but seldom interact with it as the platforms I view it on are fairly uncooperative. The version on my mobile is more of a random news post generator as it refreshes the page after every interaction. Also I definitely agree with the well-known conclusion that opinions are like assholes; everybody has one (and there’s a lot of people on social media). As for Zoom, I investigated it and found the site to be confusing as it is aimed primarily for corporate use. However a society I assist with at their events have paid for a membership and we all joined in for a group watch and quiz. A second get together then followed and worked quite well as we discovered more features. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? In the early days it was quite mad. Since my partner was also here (before relocating to her retired parents as they had a spare bedroom with bathroom to make shielding easier) I ensured that we had a couple of weeks of basics on hand and since I had access to the warehouse at work I brought home a few of the cubicle style toilet rolls (we have hundreds of them). Since then it has calmed down a lot and I go in the evenings. Now the issue is clothes (socks/shoes) due to the limited supermarket options (I bet Asda wished they didn’t have George as a separate store) and WHSmith who has such short opening hours it is beyond ridiculous. As a consequence I have decided to subscribe to the two magazines I usually purchase. I had contemplated doing this previously when I had a run in with a WHSmiths supervisor who had publically accosted me and suggested (falsely) I was taking their stock without payment and when corrected didn’t assist me with the problem I was there for. So this was the decider. The other problem is collecting my partner’s prescriptions. They will not deliver despite having a poster for the service in the window and advertising it online. Also the carers that the Government recruited have never contacted us once. We got a letter with identification instructions but there has been no telephone calls and hence no support of any kind. As for diet; I was pretty good at the beginning but as time passed I feel into poor habits that I’m trying to address. I also had not exercised as much I should lately but I have compensated slightly by gardening. I have an unruly garden and due to the amount of trees it’s more akin to forestry work. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had increased my time in the garden but lately scaled back due to the very hot weather (I’m fair skinned and much prefer a cooler climate). I’m still slightly annoyed that the neighbours who have been furloughed could achieve far more whilst I was stuck working from home. I actually spend less time on things I used to do before because I have to do more things and because I have to nursemaid my brother through all his admins issues most nights. I have also failed to watch any of the backlog of films I own but I have watched a huge amount of YouTube across a wide number of topics. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I have tried to increase the frequency of my teeth brushing. Something I wanted to do and since dentists were closed it seemed a good idea. I still maintain the same general hygiene standards I have always done (with additional handwashing). One thing I had been doing is a fungal treatment for a toe. I try to shave more often as it makes the whole process easier. I have a body hair trimmer and I have used it to tidy up areas around the ears and around my neck. I did try to trim my hair above my ears as well but it was obviously not going to work as described so I abandoned that idea. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. This is one area where things could improve. As already mentioned it’s all becoming very timeless at home. Sometimes (well often) I can fall asleep on the sofa and wake in the early hours (the latest/earliest being 5am). I do have some drinking chocolate that I have at night but it doesn’t have any different result from the coffee I would normally have (I never get any ‘buzz’ from coffee). My sleeping hours seem to have shifted resulting in my later waking which obviously moves everything along as a consequence. I’ve had a few strange dreams but nothing directly related to current events. Sometimes I dream about my parents (my mother passed away a year ago)."

Male, 36, co-habiting with partner in Cardiff. Working as a policy manager for a UK charity. Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health In my household neither of us have had any particular needs for physical health support. My partner has a low-level ongoing health condition that makes her a bit more vulnerable to the virus so we’ve been conscious of that throughout and I’ve tried to do the bulk of visits to shops and collecting her prescriptions. We’ve both actually found the lockdown a bit easier for us to keep up a healthy lifestyle as we’ve been planning our meals more due to visiting shops less frequently, ‘rationing’ fatty foods and alcohol, and going on more frequent walks and doing exercise. We’ve both actually lost some weight during the lockdown, which is something that tends to happen to me when I’m feeling more settled. Mental health has been a slightly different issue. I was having two counselling sessions a month anyway to help with various long standing mental health issues. I had a bit of an unscheduled break at the beginning of the lockdown as I was very busy and didn’t get around to scheduling a session, but they were very helpful for me in just processing what was happening. The uncertainty of everything has been quite unsettling. I know we both found it difficult at home as we approached dates/anniversaries/etc and accepted that we wouldn’t be taking holidays we’d planned/hoped for. Apart from that we’re both quite laidback at home. There have been some tensions over issues to do with the house, which jobs we’re prioritising home, and our plans for the future. But overall I think it has shown that our relationship was already in a decent state before the lockdown and we also have some privileges with stable jobs/income, a spacious house and garden, and living in a busy urban area with a lot of parks, shops and spaces nearby to keep things fresh. Government I didn’t have a very high view of the UK Government before the pandemic and I’ve an even lower view now at the time of writing, about 5 months since the lockdown started. For me the key decisions were taken too slowly and there seemed to be a bit of a breezy overconfidence in how well the UK was prepared for the outbreak. This was best symbolised by Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, downplaying the risks of the virus early on, saying he was still going around shaking hands with coronavirus patients, and then apparently contracting the virus. My partner has a health condition that makes them more vulnerable to the virus and I suggested they start working at home at the beginning of March, and the lockdown didn’t start for a good two or three weeks after that. I think many more people with these conditions should have been instructed to do that. Overall the UK Government seemed to me, and still seems, too fixated on keeping certain economic interests going over the health of the population. There has been a lot of overpromising and underdelivering too, on things like the track and trace system and on testing levels more generally. A lot of government attention seems to be on managing public opinion over putting in place the steps needed to control the virus, so the track and trace system in England is reportedly only finding under half of people’s contacts but the UK Government is pushing the ‘Eat out to help out’ scheme to encourage people to eat at restaurants Monday to Wednesday. The scheme reminds me of the wartime measures in World War Two where the public were encouraged to do fairly low value actions (like donating pots and pans supposedly for making into weapons/planes) to keep them onside. I’m sure I’m not the only respondent who will mention the incident where Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s main adviser, was spotted breaking lockdown rules the government he worked for set but facing almost zero consequences for doing so. For me it was quite symbolic of the state of the UK Government overall: that rules are just for the little people and there to be ignored for the elite, who claim to be anti-establishment. I resent Cummings more every time I learn more about him. News Living in Wales I was irritated by the UK media’s lack of attention and inaccurate reporting of the virus in Wales. Many journalists said things applied to the ‘UK’ or to ‘Wales and England’ when they really meant England. They seem so oblivious to world outside of London. It also means people in Wales get inaccurate information about what’s really happening. I know, for example, that the tracking and tracing scheme in Wales is much, much better than in England and many fewer people have died from the virus as well. But the figures all seemed to get lumped together with England, so people probably think the Welsh Government is not doing that well either. Having said that, I’ve seen opinion polls that rate the Welsh Government’s response to the virus much more highly. Definitely in my area of work I’ve seen the Welsh Government do some very good and effective things in response to the virus that are much better than what’s happening in England. I know a lot of people in Wales are hearing more about the First Minister and Welsh Cabinet from the press briefings on TV. The brief for this directive mentions the BSL interpreters appearing at the Scotland briefings with Nicola Sturgeon, but Wales has been doing it as well. I like that the devolved governments are being more accessible with their communication and making sure deaf people who use BSL can get the same health information as everyone else. It says a lot to me that the UK Government briefings don’t use BSL interpreters. Work and home life Both I and my partner have continued to work during the lockdown. I was very well setup to do so anyway due to my role, and the fact I’m quite mobile in my job anyway and have a work laptop and mobile. Before the lockdown I’d be working from a few different offices and my home anyway, so this was just an extension of what I was already doing. It was a big process of adapting for my colleagues in London though as many hadn’t done so before and they often live in quite small living spaces where there isn’t a lot of space to work separately from the more domestic spaces. That’s a privilege I’ve had and I don’t forget that I have a proper small office space in a box room in the house (and my partner has a dinner table to work on in a separate room and we’re both working in our favourite working spaces in the house.)  In a strange way I’ve quite enjoyed having more time together with my partner (e.g. lunch times together) so when we see each other properly in the evening we’ve already talked about work during the day and can think about other things. I’ve also felt less rushed because I haven’t been travelling to offices or meetings for work and have been able to use that time for lying in, spending more time preparing meals, or doing other things. We only have a cat at home and no other pets or children, so that’s another struggle we haven’t had. Working around childcare commitments has been really big for some colleagues/friends, especially those who have children younger than teens who are a bit less self-sufficient. They’ve had to be quite flexible and work at slightly odd times of day when the kids are in bed. People sometimes seem to joke that ‘working a home’ means pretending to work but my experience has been very different. Due to my area of work I’ve been equally busy as when my work has peaked in the past in normal times. There has been little let up although at the time of writing in August, with the school summer holidays coming and a heatwave just passing, everyone seems to have slowed down a bit more than before. Some friends have been furloughed and I know many were keen to carry on volunteering their time to other organisations or causes. The weather during lockdown has also been good overall, which has helped everyone feel at least a little bit better. Our relationship at home has been okay although I’ve felt quite anxious at some points during the lockdown and both my partner and I have gone through phases of feeling a bit fed up with being restricted and by life seeming a bit more monotonous than usual. I started to really miss seeing friends and family, and being spontaneous and going for a pint in the pub in the evening. As the lockdown lifted a bit across Wales we have been seeing friends in parks and visiting family in gardens and that has been really enjoyable. I’ve really savoured those experiences and don’t want to take them for granted again. We haven’t been very quick to relax our own personal lockdown, so while pubs/restaurants have opened indoors now we haven’t been yet but have had some takeaways. A friend of mine commented about life during the lockdown that rung true for me, particularly in the early stages. He said every morning felt like a Monday and every evening like a Friday. Technology Access to technology has made a difference to me during lockdown. As I mentioned before, I was used to working remotely before and with colleagues across GB I was used to video calls etc. We have probably had more meetings during the lockdown than before, probably because London based colleagues are more used to having lots of contact with each other. We’ve started using Zoom rather than our official work platform (Skype) because it seems to work a bit better and we can use it for external meetings more easily. Apart from that I’ve used Whatsapp a bit more to stay in touch with people I would’ve contacted anyway. I’ve sent a few ‘welfare’ messages during the lockdown, just checking on friends and family and especially those who I know live alone. Things during the lockdown seem to have gone through phases. Early on a lot of people were trying the Houseparty app, which we tried a couple of times, but that has tailed off. We’ve also had a few notable events happen, like friends’ birthdays, where we’d normally meet in person so we’ve been trying to replace that with video calls. It’s not quite the same although I have to admit sometimes it’s quite nice for me as a bit of an introvert to be still at home while socialising. Some of our best times during the lockdown have been over technology, whether celebrating friends’ birthdays or catching up. We’ve also listened in to a DJ that we both like who used Twitch to broadcast a set of songs, including a video of him DJing and a chat box. That was great for us and had sentimental value as we used to see that DJ at a pub that has now closed. The pub was where we met each other for the first time, introduced by a friend. Shopping and food We’ve changed our shopping habits during lockdown and made some smaller changes to our food. Before the lockdown we’d usually visit our local shops quite regularly, even every few days, and we have a good spread of shops within 5 mins walk including a corner shop, ‘world’ food shop, a fruit/veg shop, and a small supermarket for other things. During the lockdown we switched to making one visit to each shop for the week, which I made so that my partner could stay away due to their health condition. It’s not been a huge change as we’ve tended to plan our meals a bit before lockdown. But it has removed a little bit of flexibility that I used to enjoy, but that’s not really a big problem. I really enjoy cooking a range of different cuisines, and trying to cook new ones, so the lockdown has given me time to do more cooking and to perfect some techniques. I realise this might not be typical but I feel lucky to not have financial worries and to have time. I dislike supermarkets at the best of times and rarely visited, and have not been to one or ordered online. I can’t even remember the last time I did either anyway regardless of the coronavirus.  I find them too big and they seem to have lots of versions of the same items, and I find them a bit crowded and stressful. Our eating habits have been largely the same as they would have been but lunches have changed, given we’re at home rather than in our offices or on the go. Working at home has given me a lot of consistency in my working location, as I mentioned previously, so I’ve been able to plan things out a bit more. For lunches we’ve eaten slightly more elaborate meals, just things like salads or soups, but been able to spend a bit more time preparing. We’ve baked a little more, including bread and flatbreads, and some cakes/desserts. That’s mainly because we’ve had a bit more time for processes like dough proving as we’re staying in the house anyway. One thing I’ve liked doing is using up old ingredients that have been hanging about and many of which are past their best before dates. This includes dried noodles and pasta, flavoured oils, old packets of tea etc. It has been like having a clearout but without having to throw things out. I hate food waste and I have to admit it has been slightly stressful for me after the shopping day to try to find space for everything and to worry a little bit about not using up everything. We’ve stocked up a little more on some things like tinned tomatoes, coconut milk and tinned beans/pulses just as a little nod to pandemic preparedness but we haven’t gone overboard. We drank alcohol quite often but lightly during the early stages of the lockdown. I remember our first day working at home together was on St Patrick’s Day and we had some Guinness cans in the kitchen and stood around for while as if we were in a bar. There was something novel and almost amusing about it. Since the early stages we’ve tailed off a bit and have found that we’re drinking less than we would in a pub. There we’d have had a couple of pints each but at home maybe we’d have a couple of half pints each. Speaking to friends it really varies but some seem to have been drinking a lot more. We were both keen to support local businesses as well, so we got some beer/wine deliveries and more recently I’ve been cycling out and returning with a bag full of drink from an independent shop we used to visit before lockdown. Those and some orders to independent food shops (bakeries and delis) are the only food and drink deliveries we’ve had. Somehow also we’ve both managed to lose weight during the lockdown. I think it’s a mix of the new structure, fewer opportunities to snack because we’re not popping to shops on a whim, and going out of our ways to make sure we do daily walks and exercise to stay fit. Entertainment and leisure We’ve gone in phases with our entertainment and leisure habits. We’ve been watching films/programmes on a range of platforms and channels, mainly on-demand like Netflix, BBC or our TV recorder box. We haven’t really branched out a lot, just been watching more of our normal shows, a mix of films, documentaries, food programmes etc. Friends, family and colleagues have been sharing recommendations, so we have watched a few things we wouldn’t usually have watched. We’ve missed watching cycling coverage as the races have been cancelled or delayed by the lockdown. It’s usually a big part of our spring and summer to watch a lot of cycling races, and a few times we did watch some older classic races on YouTube with friends who are also into cycling watching at the same time. That was earlier on when things were still a bit novel. We’ve been watching a few complete seasons of programmes due to having some extra time and I have to mention the Tiger King series on Netflix, which I’ll forever associate with that surreal time at the beginning of lockdown. It was a very odd show about an eccentric man in the USA and seemed just right for the slightly unhinged times. Everyone seems to have forgotten about it now. We also watched a TV adaptation of Normal People, which was a nice escape. Early on I had some aspirations to develop some skills, like continuing with my French learning that I’d been doing on and off for a while and maybe some practical skills. It was hard to focus particularly for a few months earlier on as my mind was often racing and on reflection I was probably in survival mode thinking about our food, safety, hygiene measures etc. I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts, some factual/documentary and some lighthearted cultural ones. I haven’t avoided the coronavirus episodes and have found them informative/useful even though I’ve more or less stopped watching news programmes on TV.  I’ve also been carrying on with reading similar things to what I read before, a lot about culture and history. It has been quite a nice mental break to think about broader things than just the lockdown, such as other countries and periods of history. We’ve taken some of the extra time at home to start and/or finish some DIY jobs. Nothing heavy, just painting, deep cleaning some parts of the house, sanding/treating wooden worktops, and a lot of sorting through old stuff and boxes. We had a mini infestation of carpet moths during the lockdown so learned quite a lot about controlling those and have (fingers crossed) got rid of them now. We also have a garden and have spent quite a bit of time tending to that and my partner looks after the plants and some edible things that we’ve been growing (e.g. herbs, courgettes and cucumbers). One thing we’ve done very consistently throughout lockdown is evening walks. Early on the Welsh Government regulations were for one exercise per day, so I tended to choose between an early bike ride or a walk. The bike rides were interesting as the lockdown had changed the city quite a lot and actually made cycling quite enjoyable as there were almost no cars about. I saw the city centre all deserted during rush hour and also other areas that would normally be busy. Our walks have started at home and been about 30 mins or so, with some longer ones at the weekend. We’ve got to know our neighbourhood really well, including places like back lanes and cut-throughs, little quirky buildings, and have admired some house/garden arrangements that we’ve looked at for ideas about our own. At some points we also foraged some blackberries, raspberries and plums that were growing from hedgerows or over back walls into lanes. We have a few standard routes that take us in different directions so we vary our route depending on the weather or how we feel. The weather has been quite good for most of the lockdown. I can only remember a handful of rainy evenings, and that has made being inside a lot easier. Personal hygiene My personal hygiene habits have stayed largely the same during lockdown. Having worked at home before I knew that washing and getting dressed were a good way to wake up and get into the right mindset for the working day. I’ve been dressing slightly down during the lockdown, including shorts for more formal meetings on Zoom. But overall I know from previous experience that it’s a good habit for me to dress for work and then change into more casual and relaxed clothes at other times. It helps separate my work and home lives. I don’t shave every day anyway but tend to keep my face stubble trimmed every couple of days so it’s neat and I shave around the edge to make sure there’s a clean line around my stubble and the rest of my face. That’s largely the same as before lockdown and I’m possibly even doing it more regularly now, partly due to having more time in the morning and also being on video calls. You get to see how your face looks much more often than when you do face to face meetings. The most notable change has been with haircuts. I know a lot of people struggled with not getting theirs done and there were a lot of interesting DIY jobs attempted. I was no different and I had ‘panic bought’ some hair clippers right at the beginning of lockdown, probably before other people had thought it through. I’d fortunately had a haircut, I think in late February, so it wasn’t until a few months into lockdown that I really felt it needed a cut. I’d usually go to my hairdresser once every six weeks or so. He’s not a fancy one, very cheap in fact, but it was still a challenge to try to recreate it at home. My partner helped with the back of my head but I did a lot of the front and sides, mainly so I could show my partner what look I was after for the back. I was a bit nervous about doing it as I didn’t want to mess up my hair given it’s relatively short and I spend a lot of time on video calls. As part of my work I sometimes appear on the news as well, so I didn’t want to look silly. The haircut was actually fine in the end and bought me a lot of time until the hairdressers reopened! It was very strange going back. He’d had a refurb during the lockdown so his place was looking very good. It was still weird in July sitting in a room with people I didn’t know for the first time since early March. Sleep and mental health I slept relatively well during the lockdown. I was having some very surreal and vivid dreams early on, that I think other people were having too. I can’t really remember them but a lot of them were mashed up versions of real things that had happened during the day mixed with worries or thoughts I’d had during the day but hadn’t expressed. There were some bad dreams, not quite nightmares but where things were going wrong at work or I was catching the virus. Even more regularly than that were dreams about people I knew and loved getting sick and/or dying. I don’t think it needs an expert in dream analysis to figure out where those were coming from! I’ve had some sleep disruption on days when my mind was racing, usually coinciding with my trips to the shops as those were my closest encounters with people during the week. I used to get a bit irritable on those days as I got more anxious and would sometimes feel like I was buzzing and on edge when I got back, like I’d been through a really dangerous experience. I suppose my body and subconscious mind felt like I was. My mental health more generally has been up and down. I had some pre-existing mental health difficulties before lockdown. Nothing really medically treatable, just really low moods sometimes and/or general anxiety. I’m glad that I’ve been accessing counselling for a long time as it’s given me the skills and experience to cope with the ups and downs. So I haven’t felt thrown by the outbreak and the changes despite not always feeling great about things. Some basic things have helped. I’ve kept a diary throughout the lockdown and it has been good to feel like the time is being recorded and each day is unique. Exercise and getting out on slightly longer cycle rides has been good both for physical and mental health, seeing new surroundings, visiting beaches or nature further away or just getting out on my own to recharge. I’ve gained some sense of achievement from the little things as well: cleaning, sorting or fixing things at home; making a nice meal; or getting through the tough days. I know I have a lot of privileges compared with many people and I don’t take them for granted."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. I have fibromyalgia and anxiety – which is getting worse but may in part be related to being peri­menopausal (I’ve not been able to have this confirmed). I’ve Please start each part of your Directive reply on a new sheet of paper with your MO number, gender identity, age, marital status, the town or village where you live and your occupation or former occupation. Remember not to identify yourself or other people inadvertently within your reply. It is best to use initials instead of real names. suffered with increasing joint and muscle pain but on a positive note, have had the time to pick up regular meditation, breathing, Qi Gong and yoga via courses run over the internet which is blooming fantastic and is helping loads. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I went to the doctor just after lockdown as I was suffering from an inability to swallow. I was referred for an endoscopy which came back clear. The swallowing issue was attributed to stress. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? They oscillate between fear, excitement, resentment, optimism, resignation, anger and calm. If it wasn’t for the looming threat of death and redundancy this time would be an absolute blessing. We’ll never get another opportunity in our lifetime to take so much time out of work to pursue other interests(albeithomebound)andhaveatime outfromwork life. Oncewe’rethroughIthink I will look back on this time as a pivotal point in my life and a real opportunity. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? There is no doubt that any political decision made during this time is difficult. But I think with hindsight, our government will be held up as incompetent and money oriented. There are mutterings that decisions made by the English government stem from an advisor who has an ideology buried in eugenics and it’s difficult to counter that argument at the moment. Actually it makes me sick to think of the way our government have behaved in comparison with New Zealand (for example). As a result we are looking at one of the highest death rates in the world and a strategy that at best causes confusion and horrifyingly appears to be deliberate. I have a number of friends working in the public sector. Not one has a good word to say about any decision made by parliament. They have struggled with mixed messaging, a lack of PPE and other resources with no clear direction or leadership from the top down. In the words of one of my friends a couple of weeks ago, ‘it’s been a total clusterfuck’. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Honestly, I have no idea. The recent message to change #stayathome to #bealert appears to have been interpreted as ‘back to normal’. I think the government like to be seen to do things without actually taking any responsibility for anything. I think mass gatherings will be banned until further notice and businesses will be encouraged to open quietly while observing ‘social distancing guidelines’. I think they will quietly ditch the ‘track and trace’ app. I think furlough will be significantly reduced from June and will end in September. I think there will be mass unemployment that will be compounded by a conscious decision to leave the EU with no deal in early 2021. I think there will be a fundamental lack of support for those who find themselves in a poverty trap. I think they will leave companies to work it out for themselves without any guidance from the government. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I try and keep myself updated via a variety of outlets. Reuters is my preferred as well as many independent journalists such as Carole Cadwaller. I don’t read newspapers as I’m not convinced any present any kind of unbiased view. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. No, I haven’t. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I think now, more than ever it’s important that all people in this country have access as much information as they can to be as informed as they can. So, any initiative that increases access to the news is good. I don’t personally have any challenges. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I was furloughed quite early on in proceedings. To be honest, I needed a break from work and it has been absolutely wonderful. My husband (G) has carried on working, mostly from home and so we both spend the working day mostly at the desk. I’ve taken the opportunity to do some online courses with the Open University and have signed up for more vocational courses that start soon with the view to start working for myself again. The situation has made me realised that I miss being in control of my own working life and that the events industry in which I work is particularly vulnerable and think will be so for some time. Once furlough ends I fully expect to be made redundant and so, I have been saving money to help us cope with that. G and I have taken this opportunity to instigate some much needed change to our lives. We have taken to getting up early and going for a daily walk at 6am to avoid the crowds. I do daily Qi Gong online via Instagram at 8am. We exercise every lunchtime (yoga or weights) and after G finishes work (cycling on the turbo mostly). I’ve taken up meditation and conscious breathing (again through Instagram). We’ve been able to eat healthier – preparing meals from scratch and we have converted a significant portion of our back garden to grow fruit and vegetables in. I’ve read books I’ve always been meaning to read and enjoying just having time to sit on the step and look at the sky. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Fortunately I don’t have any children and so our life has been much easier than most. G and I get along really well and I’ve been enjoying his company as I usual work from home alone. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I’ve embraced Zoom for a weekly conference. It’s been fun to experiment with it. I’ve also used Facetime and other platforms to keep in touch with friends who I hadn’t seen for ages (we were due to meet up this month in Lanzarote – but that didn’t happen) and have enjoyed being able to speak with others ‘face to face’. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I’ve mostly stopped using Twitter and Facebook. Instagram is a much more constructive and positive site and so I have probably increased my use of this – especially to interact with people going ‘live’ (both the breath workshops and the Qi Gong use Instagram live). Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Apart from the first couple of weeks of panic buying, the supermarkets have been reasonably stocked and reasonably accessible using a face mask and ‘social’ distancing. Because we are reasonably healthy and live in an area with a high demographic of older and less mobile people – we have refrained from using online ordering for groceries Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Our eating habits have mostly stayed the same except we have taken the opportunity to cook even more of our food from scratch and get a little bit more creative with the bits left over we would normally discard. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We’ve increased our exercise and movement generally – a product of not being tied to a desk for eight hours. We’ve done a jigsaw which was fun to do. We made the decision to get rid of our television at the start of the year when the TV licence expired. So, we’ve beenwatching a few box sets onNetflix. ‘Glee’, ‘Sex Education’, ‘TigerKing’ and ‘The LastDance’ plus food documentaries and back toback ‘Crossfit episodes from various Crossfit Games. We’ve generally listened to Radio 2 during the day – having to turn the radio down to avoid the news ever hour becomes a bit tedious and re-discovering bands we used to love in the 80’s and 90’s. I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction. A lot that focuses on walking, the outdoors and exploration (Roger Deakin, Nan Shepherd and Rob Macfarlane). Improving communication and emotional intelligence, changing habits (James Clear) and the odd Agatha Christie. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? They haven’t changed much since lock down. I have worked from home for over a year and a half nowandessentiallyhadaroutineinexistencethathasn’tchangedmuch. IfanythingItendtowear more workout clothing during the day so I don’t need to get changed for lunchtime exercise, otherwise all is as it was. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Sleep has been very poor during the lockdown. I really struggle to achieve deep sleep and wake up during the night. Both me and G have also suffered from numbness and pins and needles in our hands, sufficiently bad enough to wake us up/keep us awake. Twice a week I attend an online breathing workshop run over Instagram. It runs for a hour, just before bedtime which seems to help with improved sleep. Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I’vehadlotsofvery weird and vivid dreams. Mostly involving being pregnant. Sadly I have a rubbish memory to remember most of the detail in any of them."

Someone who is healthy can do all these things in daily life without too much difficulty, and if you can’t do one or more of these things, you are not really healthy.  Wellbeing, to me, is the consequence of using this capacity for health – a comfort or sense of ease. There are both physical and mental aspects of wellbeing. Words that come to mind when I think of a healthy body:  resilient, efficient, natural, balanced, sound. There isn’t a particular image that comes to mind when I think of these qualities. My own experience of health has been influenced, firstly, by my age. For my parents’ generation the threat of disease was real, as were pre-NHS medical costs. My father nearly died of diphtheria when he was four; my mother of pneumonia in her twenties just as the first antibiotic treatments became available. In my generation we caught measles, whooping cough, chicken pox and mumps one after the other, whole classrooms at the same time.  The exceptions were polio, for which a vaccine had just been developed; tuberculosis, for which the BCG vaccine had been available for some time, diphtheria, tetanus and smallpox.   As a small girl I recall having to go with my family to a sort of portacabin where we had chest X rays: a case of TB had emerged at the school where my father taught and the local authority was vigorous in tracing contacts. I also remember attending ‘sun-ray sessions’ on Friday afternoons. Fifty or sixty small children sat in a darkened room with vests removed and wearing googles against the light of a sun lamp. This was supposed to help us fight colds and coughs by increasing our Vitamin D levels. Class has also influenced my health. It was a long time before I realised how childhood diseases which to us seemed routine are very serious for disadvantaged or poorly nourished children; or how privileged we had been that our mother didn’t work outside the home and so was able to nurse us when we were unwell. This meant that we had enough time off school to recover properly from an illness before going back into the fray. A third factor has been gender. When I was old enough to become a feminist (1970s and 1980s), women’s health and sexual health were big topics: like many women at the time I took active steps to understand how my body worked and what could go wrong.  At the time this felt like an obligation: we saw the medical profession as male-dominated and not especially informed about or supportive of women’s health. The moment when I realised that I could inform myself and take charge of my own health was definitely a key moment. Everyone I knew bought a copy of ‘Our Bodies Ourselves’. I reached puberty quite late (I started menstruating at thirteen and a half) but had read books given to me my mother and knew roughly what to expect. Looking back, at the time I don’t seem to have been very interested in bodily changes. I was much more affected by a tendency to faint, which I’m now sure was hormonal. It was very embarrassing. As I was growing up health (and particularly nutrition) was taught by my parents around the kitchen table. We ate our cabbage, not to remember the starving children in the world, but because cabbage is nutritious. All cooking at home was done from scratch and until I was in my teens, my mother’s menus followed second world war rationing principles – wholegrains, plain vegetables, fresh fruit, raw food, fish, and not much meat or dairy except milk. By today’s standards, though, there was too much sugar, which may explain why our teeth needed to be filled from the age of six.  In my mother’s mind this diet had kept people healthy and it would do the same for us. Mum was particularly keen on digestive health: syrup of figs, a fennel-tasting laxative and liquid paraffin were all kept in the medicine cupboard and dispensed freely.  M6749, Female, 65, married, Oxford, retired university administrator There were also many stories at home about the difference that the coming of the NHS had made. One of my father’s favourite novels (and now one of mine) was The Citadel by A.J.Cronin. I picked it out of his bookshelf when I was seven or eight and was horrified by its account of the impact of poverty, poor living conditions and an incompetent and corrupt medical profession on ordinary people’s health.  I would say that this novel has been a very strong influence on me. My father’s family were quarrymen and canalmen in a Black Country industrial village: injury at work or sickness usually led to unemployment or premature death. Both my grandfathers died, I think, from overwork. All my father’s family told stories about the coming of the NHS and how grateful they had been to have long standing conditions treated at last. By contrast, my mother’s middle class family could afford to pay for medical treatment when needed. She kept a slightly snobbish preference for private medicine until the end of her life. Both my parents were keen on exercise: on team games and sports of all kinds (they were both teachers, so could hardly advocate otherwise); and on walking. My mother cycled and attended aerobics classes until her mid eighties. I’ve inherited an enjoyment of walking and yoga from her but have learned that I can’t handle anything too competitive. No one at home was any good at sleeping and I have inherited that too. I now think that both my parents were susceptible to stress and found it difficult to relax. In my house 3am was often a busy time – people talking to each other downstairs in the kitchen, clunking the biscuit tin, opening and shutting the fridge, making milky drinks and cups of tea. My father’s mental health was often poor: he had periods which would now be diagnosed and treated as anxiety and depression, which made him withdrawn and irritable. At home this was described as ‘worry’. When I was working, not only did I smoke cigarettes, but I had appalling sleep patterns and day after day would get up and drive a long commute on three or four hours’ sleep.  Now that I have retired one of my greatest pleasures is to know that I can wake in the light for almost all the year and will not have to get up immediately and drive. I value good sleep. I’m generally much more aware of health and wellbeing now. Five years ago I had a period of depression. I was lucky enough to be offered a new talking therapy called interpersonal therapy (there were studies going on locally). I learned how to take care of myself on an ongoing basis to help prevent it happening again. I know that I have to be aware of who makes up my network of family and friends, particularly those who give me support, and to give them regular time and attention. I have to take some kind of physical exercise and to eat properly on a daily basis. Looking back, this was an unpleasant enough event in my life to make me change my behaviour. I hope that I’ll continue to be able to look after my health. At the moment I am overweight, although not obese. I know that reducing by two stones will be helpful and that I need to take it seriously over the next year.  I get most of my health information online: for example, the NHS website, which is informative and, in my opinion, reliable. I’m astonished at the amount of ‘health advice’ available online and on social media and tend to regard it all as rubbish. I have never really understood a connection between health and wellbeing and external appearance. I haven’t bothered about looking ‘young’ since the age of about 25 although I did dye my hair until I turned 50. I have never regretted stopping that. I fell in love with my wife because to me, she is the most beautiful woman I know, both in appearance and in personality, and that’s enough. However I do have really dry skin and worry that if I were cast away without lip balm my lips would crack like badly cast concrete. Perhaps if my desert island had sheep I could gather lanolin from their wool. Otherwise I’d suffer. M6749, Female, 65, married, Oxford, retired university administrator My routine for leaving the house is very basic. If I’m leading a visitor tour at the library or welcoming visitors at the church, I try to look neat and respectable, and that’s it. That’s very similar to how I saw things when I was working, since I was lucky enough to work for most of my career in marvellous organisations which didn’t judge women’s contribution by their appearance. I know my mother would be horrified; once her Baptist mother died she was free to wear lipstick and never left the house without it. I’m not going to worry about whether that really is freedom."

Until now I have been extremely fortunate. I have been exposed to the coronavirus but as far as I know I haven’t contracted Covid-19. I am lucky that I am retired, so have not had concerns about whether or how to work from home, or about income. My house is small but it’s okay. We have a small garden and I have an allotment plot. I am fortunate to share the house with my wife and we can have as much online contact with family and friends as we want. I’m in good health. My wife has diabetes, so is being particularly careful not to become exposed to coronavirus. She is also waiting for an operation to remove an ovarian cyst, which has been deemed essential but not urgent, so has been delayed. At times she has had extreme pain from the cyst, but the GP has told her that there is nothing that she can do to help while the hospital is clearing urgent surgery. If we go to A&E we will just be sent home again. Being cooped up together for the past few weeks has been okay – in fact it has been nice to have company for more of the day. The physical distance from family and friends feels no worse than when I lived abroad in pre-internet times. We have caught up on books, watched films, rested, enjoyed the sun and been in touch with friends and family. Something that helped was that five years ago I had a patch of depression and learned some daily routines to avoid slipping back. That experience has been useful. We both have a few low days. I sometimes wonder what Iam ‘supposed’ to be doing and whether I am using my time constructively enough. I am sure there would have been more of these days if either of us or anyone in our family had become seriously ill, or if the weather had not been so good, or if we had no outside space to let off steam. There is no question that we know how well off we are: people who are home-schooling, or unwell, or worried about elderly relatives, have had a lot more worry. I have volunteered for the second phase of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial, for people 56-69. It feels like a small useful thing that I can do here where I live. The Government Without doubt the government has been caught on the hop. There have been emergency management planning exercises (of course) but the lessons have not been learned. Supplies of protective equipment available for workers who have high exposure to the new virus have been lacking. Our long standing disconnect between health and social care services has been left unaddressed for too long and we are experiencing the consequences. Also I don’t now understand why the early contact tracing efforts were so poor and were dropped so quickly. The UK has had STI tracing for decades and local authority tracing, for example for food poisoning outbreaks. I started out extremely sympathetic to the horrible situation the Government was faced with but I now feel very disappointed and mistrustful. Like most people I am very relieved at the Government’s financial support for workers, businesses and the economy in general. However the steep hill that we will have to climb to repair the economy need not have been so steep. I cannot understand why the country was not formally locked down until 23 March, why a public health mass testing programme for Covid-19 was not prioritised and developed early on and why the appalling situation in care homes and prisons remained hidden from view for so long. I can’t shake from my mind the suspicion that the Government thought that it was unavoidable, or even acceptable, for a lot of disabled or elderly people to die, or why it took so long to realise that so many of the casualties would be black or from other minority ethnic groups. In future? They need to take a track, trace and isolate approach seriously. What seems lacking at the moment is an efficient system (results should not be delayed). They also need to be prepared to confront people who won’t isolate. Over the past few weeks, like most people I am aware of a very few friends and neighbours who already don’t stick to the ‘rules’. I am not happy that I have so quickly lost respect forpeoplewhothinkit’sokaytoputothersat riskby not cooperating. I have given up some of my volunteering because I have seen a different side to a few individuals. Realistically, they need to decide what should happen to individuals who really won’t cooperate. News I’m relying mainly on the BBC for news and (contrary to the criticism that it has attracted) I think the quality of investigation and explanation has been very good. I generally read the Guardian and the Economist for comment and for contrasting perspectives. I have watched the Government briefings. It is a good idea to have regular and consistent briefings but I am weary of the format and increasingly I distrust the official figures and explanations of policy, which seem repetitive, disingenuous and poorly pitched. I shouldn’tbe so affectedbythebumblingdeliveryand verbiage of the men and women in suits, but I am. Some of the scientists/senior medics are as managerial in their speech as the ministers and as little able to communicate with their audience. In particular I am aghast at the inability of the prime minister to speak clearly, answer direct questions and, at times, finish a sentence. I would expect BSL interpretation or closed captioning for the Government briefings. Have we not had an Equality Act since 2010? Recently the BSL interpreters seem to appear more frequently, and that is good. Sometimes I find their communication clearer than that of the politicians. Gradual opening up of society and the economy is really important now, but other countries have a reallyclearschedule/timetabletodoso. ForexampleIlookedattheIrishgovernment’sfull-pager in the Irish Times and was immediately clear about what was likely to happen, when, still accepting that if the unexpected happened the schedule could flex. Work and home life I know that many, many others have real worries about money and jobs and think a major employment programme of some kind to support young adults will be necessary. All the volunteering activities I have been doing since I retired (the local museum and library, the heritage project in the village, bellringing) have shut down for the time being, although groups have quickly developed online alternatives. That has been okay. My wife has been working from home. She is a mental health support worker, so is speaking to clients by phone, email and text. After a stressful couple of weeks initially, that now seems to be working well. Given the choice I think she would prefer not to go back to a cramped and busy office. Technology I was already familiar with online conferencing from my former workplace. In the past weeks it has really been about using more modern systems, all of which seem to be pretty much the same. However friends who are teachers and who are using this kind of tech for the first time really don’t like it. I’m not particularly tech-y: I just had a few years’ start. I’ve participated in a few online meetings (committees, volunteer meetings and so on) and enjoyed yoga classes led by my usual teacher on Zoom. She seems to have moved very smoothly to the new format. We have been keeping in touch with friends and family. We have used Whatsapp, Zoom, texting, email and old fashioned postcards and letters. At first it seems odd to be doing this with friends who live around the corner, but the strangeness wore off quite quickly. I have really enjoyed having enough time to write a proper email or letter. We have two new great-nephews and quantities of baby spam arrive daily: that has been lovely. My sister in Belfast and I have been reading the same books and talking about them. For example we have both loved Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light (suitably sized for a long lockdown). It has been a total luxury for me to read for at least an hour or two every day: other than holidays I haven’t been able to do that for decades and have tried a lot of authors new to me – James Meek, Maggie O’Farrell, Donna Leon, Tove Jansson, Elizabeth Strout, Marilynne Robinson, Eugene McCabe, Natalia Ginzburg. A neighbour has lent us a pile of DVDs so we have also been catching up on films we have never seen. I’m not an enthusiast of social media although do have almost dormant accounts for the usual platforms. Ihaven’tusedFacebookmuchforyears,butamfindingitusefulnow: for example there are several groups for bellringers. Some bellringers at Harvard university have developed software which simulates ringing bells in teams and so allows people to take advantage of the lockdown to practise and learn. I’ve had a couple of attempts at using the software with friends. Shopping and food Shopping has been odd. Neither of us is very happy to shop face to face at the moment, even though it is probably less risky than we think. Although vulnerable, my wife doesn’t qualify for priority deliveries to the completely housebound advertised by the supermarkets. Shopping, including hunting down collection slots or items in stock has become a boring new hobby for me. My fantasy is that ‘afterwards’ I won’t bother to shop at all but just have everything delivered, like my mother in the 1950s. But I’mnot surewecouldaffordit. We have taken to having milk, yoghurt and a fruit and veg box delivered each week, but we still need supermarkets and chemists. I don’t like the anxious atmosphere that pervades the queues outside shops at the moment and I really don’t like being around people who are not even trying to distance physically. The allotment is fine and feels really safe, but we can’t live off kale all the time. For many years I have cooked meals from scratch and I enjoy occasional baking. So far I have managed to keep a supply of flour and yeast for baking (just about). The main challenge has been to plan meals in advance: I have discovered that I am really terrible at doing this. There is no room for error: forgetting to order the eggs has consequences. Personal hygiene I live in casual clothes with a couple of presentable outfits for when I am giving tours or doing other public-facing volunteering. That hasn’t changed, though I am surprised at how much I miss the nudge to smarten up a bit, even just a few times a week. I haven’t yet needed to take the scissors to my own hair, thought that time may come. It has just become a little less short. Neither E nor I dye our hair and so we are just staying grey and curly and a bit wild. Neither of us goes in for manicures or facials so we can say in truth that we are no scruffier than usual. That feels fine. We have made some smart face coverings from spare cotton fabric: so far I have worn mine twice, on the bus and in a shop. I now feel less selfconscious but my spectacles still mist up. The main difference has been the regular handwashing and cleaning/sanitising the house. thought that I used to do handwashing well, but nothing like this. However much cream I put on them my hands stay dry and cracked. I have always hated housework and cleaning but push myself into an hour’s cleaning and sanitising every day whether I feel like it or not. Usually, I don’t feel like it. The house doesn’t really look cleaner: the shabby areas are just easier to see. And who would have thought that we would be washing the shopping? Sleeping My sleep has been okay in the past weeks, neither better nor worse than usual. I have been hoping for vivid Covid dreams, but sadly haven’t had any."

However my contracted hours have vanished and been replaced by a completely different shift pattern which has included late shifts. This has made me very tired and it is unsettling because all our routines have gone. My Partner suffered more mentally during lockdown due to not seeing people, or going out for several months, other than to take me to work. It is much better now for both of us though we are still being extremely careful. We have suffered anxiety and sometimes (I still do, due to issues at work) but we did find that when we stopped looking at the news briefings it largely vanished. Changed working hours and poor sleeping patterns due to those changes have not helped it has to be said. In common with everyone I know that anxiety levels have crept up at times but they are certainly not severe. We have not required any medical or professional help at all during this time. Our emotions were high at the start of lockdown, partly because it took the Government so long to finally bring lockdown in and also because at the beginning we thought it a good idea to keep abreast of events with the news. We realised very quickly that the latter was a very bad move and stopped watching the news or looking at any Covid19 links on social media. We knew what we had to do to stay safe and legal and that was all that mattered. Once we had done this anxiety levels dropped to a minimal level and we were much happier. We kept in regular touch with family and friends by phone, letter & social media and basically just got on with it. The Government I think that the Government have made an absolute pig’s ear of a mess of this whole Covid19 crisis. We have zero confidence in them. The lockdown was brought in far too late and the large gatherings that were permitted just prior to it finally being brought in were both ridiculous given what we all knew was happening in mainland Europe and no doubt deadly for many. Issues with PPE shortages for NHS and front line care staff were a national disgrace and the issues caused to care homes, their staff and residents are unforgivable and unconscionable. It is as clear as crystal that they were planning a herd immunity approach and then changed course at the last minute, the price that the population and care workers have paid for the Government’s ineptitude is utterly disgusting. They are incapable of making a simple decision and sticking to it; everything is vague, woolly and subject to sudden switches in policy. As a result people are confused, unsure and in some cases have just given up trying to figure it out. Many now behave as if it is all over and I believe the Government is largely to blame for that lackadaisical attitude. They are a shambolic disgrace and their decisions or lack thereof have led to thousands of unnecessary deaths, and will probably be responsible for more to come. I think that the decisions this Government will make in the coming months will be based on reviving the economy and protecting business, just as they were back in March. They will try and resuscitate the economy even in the face of spikes and local outbreaks, not to mention an almost unavoidable oncoming world recession. They will probably kill more businesses than they save and I have no doubt that their policies will kill more people. They will plunge us back into austerity, so we will be without doubt worse off than we have been in the last 10 miserable years. I have absolutely no faith in Boris Johnson or any of his ministers and in the light of the whole Dominic Cummings debacle it is clear who is actually running the whole shooting match and any trust has gone out of the window. News I do not watch or listen to news unless there is to be an important announcement. I occasionally scan the BBC News website to pick up on any important bulletins. If you want to remain sane in this modern world it is best to avoid news as much as possible. I never take a newspaper and to be honest I am never really sure which media outlets to trust in terms of bias and freedom of speech. This is not a Covid19 thing; I have not regularly followed news for 15 years. We have always been kept aware of important Covid19 advice and guidance with the C-19 Covid Symptom Study run by Kings College London, which we report to each day. They give us all the guidance and news we need to keep abreast of things and stay safe. No we have not watched the daily briefings for all the reasons listed above. We have never had any issues with getting access to news or media if we have wanted to see it. Work and home life I have been working during the Covid19 lockdown and we have had to work on various shift patterns including late shifts which I am not contracted to work and that has not been nice at all. It continues to be a source of frustration and stress because due to low staffing levels and some staff still isolating at home, even now, we are not being permitted to return to our normal hours. I am feeling much more tired and my regular sleeping patterns have gone out of the window. My Partner is retired so has been stuck at home on her own while I have been doing even more hours and this has been very difficult for her. She is not IT savvy so cannot do video calls unless I am home, although I did manage to set them up for people to call her which helped. She has missed seeing her friends & lost all her usual social outings and connections. In the last 3 weeks we have been to see people in their gardens & she has been to see her bubble buddies while I have been at work and that has been a huge help for her morale. We were able to do video calls to family and friends and online quizzes with friends which helped in the early days. However, outings concerts and trips which had been planned months ago were cancelled and some like the Tutankhamen exhibit at the Saatchi Gallery can never be repeated, and that is sad. I miss seeing my family who all live miles away. We have not had to home school and as I have gone to my place of work our home life has not been disrupted by my working from home. We have been together for 37 ½ years and get on so well that this has not impacted on our relationship at all, if anything it has brought us closer together. We are very self sufficient and self reliant. I know from the huge number of emergency homeless cases we have dealt with at work due to domestic violence that this has not been the case for many. We have lost several dear friends during lockdown and not being able to attend their funerals has been absolutely awful. Technology I am used to technology both at work and at home so I am very familiar with its use. We have kept in touch with family and friends around the world with Messenger and Whatsapp and by telephone too. We all started off messaging every day but as the weeks went by and everyone got used to lockdown we were all online less. Now most of us message every few days and I spend very little time on social media nowadays. I have used social media to escape from events rather than follow them. I have found that, over the months anyone who continuously spouts or shares politics, negativity or nasty posts has simply been “un ­followed”. My Face book feed has dwindled to barely a trickle of posts now, so Covid19 has had a very healthy impact on my social media usage. Shopping and food From three weeks prior to lockdown until last Thursday 23/7/20 we had not been to a supermarket at all. We have used our local village butcher once a week who has kept us supplied with nearly all we needed and would have delivered if we had needed to isolate. Our milkman has also left essentials on our doorstep. Any other requirements have come via online shopping which I was doing long before lockdown anyway. We have not had any challenges at all and have saved an awful lot of money. We will now go to our local Lidl once a week in the evening when it is quiet, but will still support Drew’s, the village shop that kept us going throughout for all our basic needs. Entertainment and leisure I am a massive reader and so when I have not been working I have done a lot of reading and have managed to clear a big pile of books which have gone into work where a colleague has set up a book swap club. I have started doing online learning which has been great. We have both gone out and got on with the gardening and planting vegetables, and have done lots of yummy cooking. We have not done any DIY as all the jobs that need doing require a professional. I have a great interest in WW1 so have read several books on that subject and two of the courses I have done have been on that period of history. I have read two books by Adrian Bell which were lovely and several on the period leading up to and during the Russian Revolution. I have done a course on NLP and am doing a course on mental health issues which will help me at work. I have this week signed up for two short courses Mindfulness and Professional Resilience Skills for Work. I absolutely love listening to music so that has been one of my favourite things to do throughout. We have adored watching Downton Abbey & the Repair Shop, but I am not as big a TV watcher as my Partner. Personal Hygiene Our habits with regards to personal hygiene have not changed as we were always avid hand washers anyway. We have both worked in care homes and home care so correct hand washing practices have always been the norm. At work we hot desk, so I have been used to going in and cleaning everything down with water and detergent, I do not use anti bacterial spray or wipes, they wreak painful havoc with my skin. For the same reason I have not used hand sanitizer but have washed my hands at very regular intervals and we have all kept the office clean and tidy. We have sanitizer in the car but have not really gone anywhere to need to use it, and that won’t really change for some time yet. We wear gloves and face mask if we go to the shop or garage. Sleep Sleep was very disturbed at the beginning of lockdown. Once we stopped watching the news things greatly improved. Vivid dreams were certainly prevalent in the first two months and there were many discussions at work about these vivid dreams which were often very deep subconscious sagas. We discovered with some research that this was one of the unusual side effects of Covid19 lockdown. I was fascinated to read that there was a link between social distancing and lockdown and these vivid and deep subconscious dreams and it was due to the fact that we had less inspiration in our daily lives so our minds were digging in to the old memories. I share this article in my Covid19 diary for Mass Observations and have attached it here too. https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/science-and-technology/2020/04/pandemic-giving-people-vivid-unusual­dreams-heres-why Weird sleep problems eased as lockdown progressed and we adjusted, my only issue now is the shift work which is leading to very late nights across two weeks a month."

That said, in the past couple of weeks (it’s now June 9th), emotions have mostly been one of incredulity and disgust with Dominic Cummings. A man who epitomises all that is wrong with an entitled elite.  A man that thinks it is OK to lie to a public and to do essentially what he sees fit in spite of all other government guidance.  To be clear it is not OK to drive 30 miles to test your eye site, 260 miles from home.  He is a disgrace. As lock down has eased the governments messages are more confusing and counter to logic, but what is logic in light of Cummings? Today we learn that people living alone can cohabit, but if you are in a house share only one of you can do so.  We announce this today, but state that its ok as of Saturday, which will immediately be ignored and one can hear the hordes gathering with immediacy and gusto. We can meet in groups of 6, but not more.  It is all as seemingly random as it is bizarre. Within my nuclear family, of 5, there have been no health problems to report.  In a wider context two of my wife’s friends/associates have committed suicide, which has been pretty nasty, including one chap driving his car into a river.  He left behind his wife and twin 9-year­old children. This did upset my wife, as one might expect. I have not needed medical help, but my wife had a jogging accident and needed a tetanus jab from the doctors.  This was a process she described as apocryphal. She was met at the door of the surgery (only a minute from our house) by a nurse in full protective gear and my wife put on a mask and gloves, before being seen to in the once waiting room.  She was then quickly and kindly ushered away.  All staff were in the gear in the surgery and the situation was best described as out of body I think, quite surreal. The Government Until Cummings I had some sympathy for the complexity of the position and the actions taken.  All of this has since eroded to one of mistrust. As cited above decisions are not without challenge, on a logical and operational front and many I’m beyond worrying about now.  Random places are opening up, Zoos soon, apparently.  I hope pub gardens and pubs soon, I miss the pub.  The management of public and mass transport is clearly complex and I would expect their operating models to be altered by the government. News Primarily I have used the Guardian online.  Initially the 10 O’clock news, on the BBC was watched, not sure why and I have watched a few Newsnight’s.  I have also watched a couple of the 5pm Government broadcasts. Access has been easy for me, though trying to discern reality from the madness has been hard.  There was an original fixation with making this pandemic a pandemic; then counting the daily dead; then the ‘R’ number, how many people you can infect if you have it; then Cummings; now getting out of lockdown.  To be honest I am finding it quite wearing. The scientists on the 5pm broadcasts have been quite impressive, answering honestly where they can some very facile questions.  Not much else to report here. I did see Michael Gove take one call whilst The PM was unwell, and he was relatively calm and coherent. Work and home life I began working from home 2 weeks before the lockdown and am now in week ‘lord knows what’, this section is under composition on July 26th 2020. In that time, as my diary will show, we have had a house hold at home of between 3 and 6. Our 3 children after week 4 have remained at home, self-learning and will do so until the autumn term begins.  My wife resigned from her role as a school welfare officer in light of the complexity of running the home and trying to manage the disorganised and chaotic school attendance program. I think it is fair to say that being at home this long has changed all of us. The early weeks were operational, we had to find out how to work and understand who would be at home.  My employers mandated home working two weeks before the government. To that end we had some earlier insights than others. We learnt that I could not stare into a laptop, constantly.  Physical impairments mostly neck aches, back aches, or headaches have been a regular narrative in our home working lives. We made purchases of desk, monitor stands and other PC peripherals, in the end for all of us. Having the liquidity to improve the technology in our house was not lost on us.  I can’t imagine how hard this situation must be for families who cannot afford technology/ additional items to improve their home life. There are probably more who do not have the space.  We bought two extra desks, changed around our rooms to get our children down stairs. Two in our kitchen diner and one in the living room. I have been working in our garden office, which has been the best investment we have ever made. It was not bought because of these events, but it was built and brought on line the week before, which was enormously fortuitous. I have worked from 4 different desks whilst down there and used beer boxes and other random items for monitor stands. Without this space I would have really struggled to be as productive. Much like the rest of the world we became bakers and cake makers.  My middle son has particularly excelled in this field.  He has made some wonderful banana breads, biscuits, scones, cakes and bread. My daughter has knocked up a few cakes and our youngest has helped along the way. I have improved my hummus making skills to something of the semi pro level.  Until lock down I would make hummus occasionally with tinned chick peas.  I am now searching out distinct dried flavours, reconstituting them for days and lording it up with all sorts of additions. These: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/07/yotam­ottolenghi-hummus-recipes have been some of my favourites and I have amended the cinnamon one to be a little more spicey, Hummus Bros, also have a great book.  I’ve been posting pictures on face book and taking request.  As a vegetarian I can say that paprika and garlic have been a highlight.  I’ve also toyed with no olive oil and all tahini versions. I dread to think what this has done to my waist line. Zoom: at home we have spent more time talking to work colleagues in non-work time than I suspected. As noted elsewhere particularly one colleague and his family. This made early weeks most enjoyable and I would suggest that we’ve had a drink on a Friday 13/14 times in the past 20 or so weeks. Over the last few weeks, to some degree as constraints have eased, we have found ourselves, collectively and 1-2-1, questioning the logic of decisions and the implications of them. Conversations at the dinner table are interspersed with the value of masks, Donald trump, vaccines and who was in the Beatles (a conversation from yesterday). On the whole I think we’ve been quite cautious. I have been out socially once. I spent an hour in the garden of my best man, we sat opposite a garden table and were distant at all points, which was odd, but pleasant.  The remainder of my limited social contact has been through digital platforms, zoom etc. I have just this past couple of weeks realised how much I miss people/my friends.  I have not been to London in over 6 months. As noted in my diary this is the longest time since I was 16.  I have not been on an aeroplane for 9 months. In normal circumstance I would expect to be on at least one flight a month. IN my pomp I was away for 80 -> 100 days a year for probably 10 years in a row.  I’m on the fence here. I’m not overly fussed by not being abroad. Technology Zoom is the technology of the day. Whilst I am conversant with collaboration tools, such as Slack; Microsoft Teams and Skype. Zoom appears to have taken over the world.  I have become a regular drinking partner with a colleague of mine on a Friday via this platform. It’s easy to use, allows for multiple attendees and can be free.  It’s not without critics in a security context, but the reward appears to outweigh the risk. We have probably had a beer 9 of the past 12 Fridays.  I didn’t socialise with him once prior. This has been a highlight.  2 weeks ago, I used Facebook’s WhatsApp platform to connect to two old housemates.  I shared a house with these chaps from 2000 – to 2002.  I haven’t seen either for 6 years. This was an unexpected highlight, also. I have been quizmaster for two Zoom quizzes with my mother, her husband and their friends.  The last event, Sunday gone, went on for 2 hours and a bottle of white wine.  My youngest kept score. More broadly I have returned to Twitter, mostly for the Cummings storm.  I made my first post since 2014 and have followed a few more people.  Richard E Grant (actor) one of them.  He has been re-enacting scenes from ‘Withnail and I’ a cult classic and one of my favourite films.  I highly recommend these.  Each snippet concludes with an infectious laugh/smile. I’ve tinkered with Facebook a little, but this is considerably less Covid19, than Cat updates and other cultural issues of the time. At this moment the focus is on the killing of a chap in Minnesota, which was utterly horrific. Shopping and food We have engaged in our first ever click and collect this week (18th May).  My wife ordered the maximum 80 items from our nearest supermarket (Tesco). She set off at 08.18 this morning and was back bat 08.38.  The store is only 1.5 miles away.  First thing I noted was the amount of carrier bags that our food order was contained in and that all of these were off white, non-branded. We must have 15 of them.  My wife’s overall review of the experience was that it was considerably better than going in the shop.  She also noted that there was a large queue outside the doors. Primarily we are purchasing all perishable goods from our local butcher and grocers.  The meat doesn’t appear to have gone up in price, but the fruit and veg has.  The grocers moved to a pre ordered model only, initially. Now one can order a box of fruit and veg with some extras.  This week we spent more than £40 on fruit and veg. which is about 25% higher than the norm.  As noted in my covid 19 diary we are baking considerably more and contributing to the shortage of flower. I can say, unequivocally, I have eaten more parsnips as a result of the veg box in the past 10 weeks than I have probably in the past 20 years.  I despise the blighters.  Tomorrow I am going to wrestle a fennel – not cooked one of them for years either. This May has been very warm, so we are using all the salad and eating quite a lot of asparagus, which I love.  This appears to be about 60 pence a stalk. Entertainment and Leisure Oh my gosh. My consumption of booze has gone through the roof.  So much so I fought my way through Sun/Mon/Tue/Wed this week to not have a drink.  4 days is the second longest period in lock down {I’m not sure when I wrote this, but for the past 3 weeks I have managed to avoid an alcoholic beverage Monday -> Friday, so I am not as yet on my way to signing up with Alcoholics Anonymous]. I would suspect that if I’ve been at home 60 days, I’ve had a drink 45 of them and my two largest, possibly only, hangovers in my 40’s have occurred in the last 7 weeks.  Home drinking, via a zoom session, with my work colleagues has become and enjoyable, but occupational hazard none the less. In a DIY context I have been proficient. As my Covid19 will show I have excelled, relative to my normal home life. I have hung more than 40 pictures in our hallway and living room; Dug out our front garden fence; re-organised the back garden and conducted a whole load of sorting out in the house (which includes fitting shelves). This past weekend I spent 4 hours laying the footings for a new shed. Within an exercise context I’m down.  I have walked the dog less than normal, though occasionally further.  I have been on the weights though, only for my arms.  I have taken some old dumb bells down to my garden office.  I have managed to go from 15 bicep curls on day one to 75 a day this working week.  I plan to move to 100 a day as of next Monday.  Most likely 4 sets of 25 across the working day. [again, some weeks later I am now at 105 a day: 3 sets of 35]. My face book usage has gone through the roof and I have today returned to twitter to post my first tweet for 3 years. I am also, at this very moment, listening to my first ever pod cast “The Pepper Pod” a conversation between the BBC’s Andrew Cotter and Eddie Pepperell ( a professional golfer)  I came here via twitter, via YouTube, via the Guardian who posted a link to Andrew Cotter commentating on his dogs.  He has a very distinctive Scottish voice and a very gentle sense of humour. I don’t like golf, one bit, but the pod casts are gently witty and provide self-deprecating humour that I enjoy. It transpires that there are people from 107 countries listening to them. There has been intersections of garden darts and Chess during lockdown. Not sure either of these are sports, but they have got us engaged as a family.  Darts I plan to pursue with my children as its good for maths. I’ve screwed the board hook up to our outdoor shed and we are using the door as the base for the board.  Our rhubarb patch is the line to throw from. Personal hygiene I am unequivocally shaving less.  In a normal working context, I would shave every day, at worst every other day. Whilst I did have a shave today, I would suggest that I am regularly leaving shaving for 5 odd days at a time now. [Note that, 4 weeks on from this comment I am back to the normal shaving pattern]. I think I’m probably showering less also, not that this is troubling me.  I have washed my hair every day for almost all of my life, at least my adult life – this has not changed. I am still using deodorant and changing my underwear and socks. Sleep No difficulties sleeping, I have had a few more dreams, I’m sure of that, but as yet nothing to recall, I shall pay more attention to this over the next few days. Oddly a week after I wrote the paragraph above, I had a dream about brown, blue and orange wall paper, initially covered in tile grout, which had been shaped by a grout comb; essentially putting tracks through the grout.  As the grout dried it fell away, revealing these very 70’s colours.  I’m afraid I have no more context, but it did make me smile."

My wife works at the local hospital and has therefore been going to work there everyday. When she comes in she will first wash her hands thoroughly and then change her clothes. A few weeks ago my youngest son, E, had a temperature which is not uncommon with small boys however he also had this very raspy cough. So, as my wife is a Keyworker at the hospital she had to firstly phone them up for advice about what to do as E was showing signs of Covid19. This meant that she was not able to go in for work on that day. We also phoned up the 111 service to check what to do. A slot was booked for my wife to take E to a carpark near the hospital where in a drive by testing young E had a swab thrust to the back of his throat. Apparently the nurse who did it was very nice and professional. We then gave E paracetamol to keep his temperature down but his temperature was raised for about 8 days. It was therefore assumed, from the off, that E had Covid19 and we should all isolate in the house for 14 days. Unfortunately the test had somehow been lost and we never found out the result. The lady from HR at the hospital said that E was a false negative and she was sure that E had the disease. After 8 days his temperature came down but his cough was still persistent. More interestingly there are 4 other people in the house, none of which showed any symptoms of the disease, myself included. We were in very close proximity to E so it is very likely that we have had the disease but are asymptomatic. We would very much like to know if we have antibodies for the virus but currently unlikely to know for sometime although it would be very helpful as it would mean I could go back to my job of teacher without fear of picking up the disease. The Government, in my mind, has been almost clueless. They have been so busy trying to be seen to do the right thing and this has got in the way of actually doing the right thing. Now we are finding out that their strategy right at the beginning was very poor. They did not put people into lock down right away and because of that, so many more people have died than needed to. They have veered from chaotic to abysmal. Only in the last few days, still thinking about Brexit, and still do not want certain people here in Britain even though the NHS is made up of an awful lot of migrants that they want to see the back of. It is appalling, clapping the NHS on one night and the next plotting to get rid of as many migrants (NHS workers) as possible. The government also don’t seem to have a clue about how to get us out of this situation whilst at the same time very much patronising the whole of the UK and treating us like non-thinking idiots. It is just awful and frightening that such clowns are in charge. I very much hope that they will announce in the coming months that they are all dreadful and they are going to resign. News At the beginning I have to admit that I was gobbling down the news voraciously. There was so much information. I usually listened to the BBC 4 news programme at 5 (PM) and then I would have to watch the Ten O’clock News on the BBC. It became almost compulsive to listen for how many people had died in Italy, in Spain and these terrible stories and then the looming prospect of it all arriving on our shores like a tsunami. I remember watching the government briefings and I would watch the whole things. And then it was questions by screen and it was quite addictive. But then, what really scared me, was looking in the eyes of these ministers and you could see that they really had no idea what they were doing. They were trotting out the same old platitudes day after day and no-one was really holding them to account. I stopped watching them on the TV as they just were telling so many lies, about the numbers of tests and so on. I do not know of anyone who has had challenges accessing the news. I think, generally the opposite is the problem i.e. getting away from the news. I think the BBC has come into its own with being a trusted media outlet. I believe that they have had record viewing figures. I also certainly think that a BSL signer should be available for briefings, perhaps on a digital channel at the same time? Work and Lockdown I have been working but my job is very student facing that it is difficult to do the job at home. When we first went into lockdown I did have a lot of paperwork that I took back home and, still eking it out, finished it all in the first couple of weeks. I have asked my manager many times but it appears that I am on standby. It is possible because I told work that I would have to be at home looking after my children as my wife would be working at the hospital. The college where I work has been closed for the duration. As I write this it is the ninth week of lockdown. We all barely leave the house. So for nine weeks I have been in charge of the home schooling and it is lucky that I am a teacher. I am secretly sure that my kids hate this fact. I think they did originally and for the first two or three weeks there was a lot of resistance to me doing all of the teaching but certainly now, in the ninth week, we have all got into a groove and routine is certainly the key to surviving the virus lockdown. Every day we go out into our little courtyard garden and do exercise for about half an hour. It is usually quite a punishing routine and it is certainly more exercise than I was used to. We do HIIT exercises, skipping, push-up competitions but I try to mix it up through the week. It is probably the barest minimum but it is keeping us ticking over. Then, at about 10 am the children log on to various wi fi devices and depending whether they need to use a computer or not depends on what they use. All of the schools that they go to have Google Class rooms set up and the week is set of the week but everyday they download the activities. You can print it out but you don’t have to. Also you do not have to do the work on line but tell the teacher that the work was written in the home book. The work is very varied but very much relies on access to the internet. The children are also looking at Bitesize on the BBC for very entertaining lessons. We tend to access that on the Smart TV (someone had to show me how to do that!). We usually stop for lunch at about one, which I tend to make. We have done a bit of baking, bread and cakes. Then at 2 we do another hour or so. I tend to read a story out loud for them for about 15 minutes. I think they like that time together. After about 3 ish, depending on how hard people have worked, we stop school work and the children are allowed to do what they want. I can then start any work that I might need to do! It has worked well and I think my relationship with my children is getting better. I think they see me, perhaps, as a bit of a more rounded parent than before. Technology In the first couple of weeks my work had decided to have lots of meetings through Google Hangouts. It was just ghastly. People interrupting all the time and it was still the same old people doing all of the talking. Pointless. I don’t go to them any more. I haven’t been fired yet but I am not sure anyone has noticed that I am missing from the meetings! Fortunately my parents are complete technophobes and are not able to contact me through the computer. They do send e-mails and there is the odd phone call. Early on I did have to tell them off as they kept going out. One thing that has been good is having my book group on Zoom. All the people in the group (apart from me!) is quite old but they are very tech savvy. It is not perfect but we do meet at the right time, we all have a glass of wine in our hands and the talk is very good. I really don’t like the long pauses and I find you just have to keep talking over people because of the gap. It is not perfect but it is better than not having the meeting. I think the older members really value it. Shopping and Food Well, at the beginning it was agreed, because my wife was going out to work anyway then she would do all of the shopping. I went once, to Tesco right at the beginning if only to get a few sheets of toilet roll. It was a very eerie experience. Since the first week my wife, being an NHS worker, was able to go at special slots and so shopping was not too horrendous and we have been able to get pretty much what we needed. That said, having told off her parents and older aunts and uncles who, because of their age had to completely isolate, well they had no way of getting shopping. At first they were a bit reticent and really didn’t want to trouble us. Now, nine weeks in, they are phoning all the bloody time and, if I may say, being very picky about what food they want. Square crumpets, and not the Tesco ones but the Warburtons ones if you please! So my wife goes on a Sunday morning, with their separate list of shopping and then she drives 20 odd miles to give it to them. I suppose it is a way to keep in contact. recently my wife has been able to use click and collect for us which she says is much better. I do feel a little guilty not having done any sort of shopping for about 10 weeks but also it has stopped me buying loads of rubbish that I would have otherwise bought. We have enough flour and we have actually been baking some bread. Some of it successful and some of it edible. everything is home cooked but we normally cook everything from scratch anyway. Entertainment and Leisure I have to say we are pretty boring. I always ask myself every year, when we go on holiday, we are we going? I love staying at home. If the weather is nice I will sit out in the garden with a cold beer, a good book and while away the hours that way. It has been almost enjoyable. Routine has been very important. At Christmas I took delivery of a piano. It was free but it was in a hell of a state. I was looking forward to playing it but just before lockdown my wife was fiddling around with the insides and broke a lot of the little straps. So essentially for the last ten weeks I have been completely renovating and 80 year old piano. I do a little bit each day and we are very nearly there. I have also learnt an awful lot about how pianos work. It has also tested my patience somewhat and this is when I missed the opportunity to go for my long walks. I am very glad to now be able to go for long walks. I have also been writing, just a little book and we shall see where that goes. I have been learning Spanish using Duolingo, Babbel and a lot of reading Spanish. I have also been memorising poems which are just about keeping my mind occupied. Personal Hygiene I am not quite sure what this question could possibly be aiming at!! I can’t say my regime on a daily basis changes at all. This is the same even if I am on holiday. However on holiday I may get lazy and not shave. I can usually last about 4 weeks before it starts turning into a beard and then gets all scruffy and I have to shave it off. However, for once in my life I have actually gone to some trouble, if only to stop the boredom. I have grown a sort of ‘Van Dyck’ beard with a bit of a twirly moustache and a long pointy sort of beard around the chin accompanied with pointy sideburns. I thought that if no-one was actually going to see me then why not. My wife likes it and very recently she bought a pot of sculpting wax. Ridiculous but it does small very nice. I think I look a little like Velasquez but the beard is so grey and ageing. I am not sure if I will keep it. I’ll keep it for now. Sleep I am sorry to have to report but I really do get a great nights sleep every night. I tend to go to bed at 11, listen to comedy on radio 4 extra until about 12 or read and then wake at about 7.30 to 8. The children tend to do their own thing in the morning and I let them have their space. I have had some interesting dreams but they have had nothing to do with Covid19 (that I can think of!) – One dream I had the other night was that I bought a very nice house but inside there were very few windows and lots of long corridors. The corridors tended to slope downwards and there was a lot of Laura Ashley wallpaper. There were bare bulbs burning bright and very high skirting boards. A female friend of mine was there and she was dress in a sort of frilly Shirley temple outfit riding a tiny tricycle down these corridors. Outside the house we were directly on the seafront almost in the middle of the dodgems!! Bizarre but very nice feeling on waking."

I’ve been meditating and using mindfulness and have also called my employer’s assistance line to discuss the challenges of managing at work when I have my husband and my children at home.  I have generally felt better over the last few weeks although I do feel really claustrophobic and have done what Ican to get out of the house and be on my own outside of the house.  I’mused to being on my own at work and it’s been hard not to be on my own.  I’ve also beento the GP to check on my HRT and to have the levels amended –I think this was affecting my mental health.  I feel much better now. The Government I think the government have been hopeless.  I’m ashamed of the entitled, arrogant approach our government has taken. So disorganised, so dismissive of the scientific advice, so hopeless. I can’t believe that we’ve been almost the worst in the world–and the government is unapologetic and still fairly rubbish. In the coming months, I imagine the government will aim to get the economy up and running, possibly putting us all at risk. News I read the newspaper every day and sometimes watch the daily news.  I also listen to the radio, however, in the last few weeks, I have stopped listening and reading so much as it is so sad, and depressing and the government doesn’t do anything that makes me proud of them, only miserable. I did watch the 5pm briefings but they were so opaque and with such limited information and never answering the questions they were asked or acting on advice or doing anything.  They infuriatedme.  I’m cross just thinking about them.  So, I stopped watching them. I think this is so important.  All news should be accessible for everyone.  Everyone should have equal access to healthcare, news, information etc.  It’s fairly typical of our arrogant government. Work and home life I already worked from home so the only thing that changed for me was that my husband and two teenage sons started working from home too.  It’s been very stressful as my husband and I are very very busy and expected to work extremely hard whilst also trying to keep on top of our family and make sure the children are healthy, doing their work and also not suffering (mental health etc.).  I am so grateful that I have still been able to work and that Ihaven’t been furloughed but it has been really difficult. I have been really quite grumpy and short-tempered.  I’ve been so exhausted and not always sleeping very well and being together ALL THE TIME can be really difficult. We’re all getting on okay but it does become stressful at times. Technology I work in IT so I have enjoyed using a landline to call people.  I have been talking on the phone to people and also texting and WhatsApp a lot.  But I use Zoom, Skype, Teams etc at worksoI reallydon’t use it EVER at home. Shopping and food I have been the only person shopping which has been really stressful at times.  It’s been exhausting and there is an expectation that I will provide for everyone. We have ended up eating the same stuff –especially now.  We really just haven’t got the time to spenda lot of time cooking andso it’s become a bit dull.  It has been lovely having our lunch together though everyday.  I’ve loved checking in with the boys and talking to them about their work.  But I don’t feel like I’ve really been able to be there for them a lot of the time.  Shopping was stressful at first, but we have some great shops who are doing deliveries which has been amazing –for 4 months we had fresh pastries delivered to our door every Saturday morning.  We’ve made some new friends from producers which has been lovely. Entertainment and Leisure I really felt like I just couldn’t read much so I read slowly.  We have watched some theatre and also some boxsets we wouldn’t have watched.  We watched some Black British History with the children whichwas excellent.  I’ve been writing!  Which I have loved.  I’ve written short stories, inspired by Covid.  We have been so busy, so I do have several friends who haven’t worked andwho have been having lots of time to take up hobbies, make interesting food, have HouseParty, do online shopping and generally just enjoy 14 weeks of no work.  I stopped resenting this quickly as I have my family and a job, that’s my focus. Personal hygiene Nothing has changed, really, as I’m at work,onvideo, every day andsoneed to carryon. My hair is very long though. Sleep I have struggled off and on with sleep. Sometimes I have woken up in the night and not got back to sleep.  I have dreamt about all kinds of crazy things.  Waking up in a different country.  Being in a nightmare.  Living with a different family.  Being stuck somewhere I don’t want to be.  It has calmed down a bitnow but I’m still not sleeping verywell.  And I’m tired."

Fingers crossed! My emotions were very steady for the first 5 or 6 weeks, but just lately I have been experiencing some ups and downs. I realise there is nothing I can do to change the situation we are in, apart from to stay and home, go out rarely and avoid other people as much as possible.  I feel very sad that I am unable to go over to Paris (which we have been used to doing every couple of months or so) to visit our son, daughter in law and grand daughter. As time as gone on I have realised that this situation won't get much better for a long time, and find the prospect of not seeing our grand daughter (who was 2 at Christmas and is growing up very quickly and at a very interesting stage) or “normal” life returning for a very long time rather depressing.  However, I manage to talk myself out of that, as there is no point in getting low.  My main emotion is anger at the way the government is mis-managing the whole situation. The Government I'm afraid many of my thoughts on the political decisions that have been made are unprintable! However, I'll give it a go: The government was very arrogant at the beginning, refusing to take any notice of the growing pandemic. They were so caught up with Brexit, going it alone and with the Brexit narrative of “Unleashing Britain's Potential”, they refused to listen to warnings or to take advantage of offers of help from the EU. Johnson missed several COBRA meetings, taking lengthy breaks at his country home, and then, after boasting of having seen his mother on mother's day and shaking hands with people when he visited a hospital treating Covid patients, he himself was taken ill with the virus and ended up in intensive care. His time was also taken up with finalising his divorce while preparing for the birth of his son.  He is a complete disaster as a Prime Minister and quite frankly, I despair. It seems that Boris Johnson, when he did start to take notice, took advice from Dominic Cummings (who is an unelected advisor and apparently an advocate of eugenics) which was to “take it on the chin – be prepared to lose members of our families before their time – let it rip through the population” to produce a so-called “herd immunity”. They followed this programme for two to three weeks, allowing large public gatherings like international football matches, and the Cheltenham racing programme to take place before eventually seeming to take notice and start to bring into action some plans – closing shops, pubs, clubs, restaurants and businesses urging people to stay at home, stay safe and protect the NHS.  It soon became apparent that the NHS was woefully underprepared for what was to come, particularly in the areas of PPE and testing etc. All these failures led to far more deaths than were necessary, and to us being the country with the worst death toll apart from USA. What has happened to NHS employees and the people working and living in care homes throughout the country is a total scandal, verging on criminal neglect. As to what the government will do in the coming months is anyone's guess. They have already decided to ease some of the restrictions, encouraging people to go back to work. Their new approach was announced by the PM by means of a TV speech on Sunday night. This was anti-democratic and not the way it should have been done. Any announcement should have been made in the House of Commons where it could come under proper scrutiny and the details worked out, before being shared with the public. He brought in new measures regarding going to work, without having told work places that they should start preparing themselves to provide safe working environments, and told people they should not use public transport to get to work... the whole thing was totally confusing and muddled – leading to a dangerous situation where eventually the public was just told to “use your common sense”. This, Iam sure, willlead to a further spike in the numbers of positive tests and deaths when presumably everything will be locked down again. News I watch the BBC news, read the i newspaper, The Guardian and the Observer. I also look at the BBC website, Byline Times online, The European and Twitter. I do watch the daily press briefings most days, but find them totally useless. The media seems hamstrung by the fact that they are asking questions via screens and seem unable to take the government spokesmen properly to task or interview them with any rigour at all. The questions from the public are fatuous. The spokespeople say the same things over and over and never give a straight answer to any questions.  Most of them, quite frankly seem entirely out of their depth. I have no problem getting access to the news, but I can imagine that having signing interpreters would make it easier for people with hearing problems, and should be introduced across the board. Work and Home Life I am extremely fortunate in this regard.  Being retired and a pensioner I have no need to go to work and have found that being made to stay in my home was no real hardship at all. I am missing out on my volunteer work, and other regular social events that I was used to attending regularly, but I have a comfortable home with a garden (which is a real godsend) lots of books to read, knitting and tapestry work to do; I get on very well with my husband and we've had no disagreements or problems with being together all day every day. I am very lucky. Technology This is invaluable and the whole situation would have been a lot worse without it. We are used to emailing, texting and WhatsApping our friends and family on a regular basis.  But these occasions have increased greatly. We have also learned how to use Zoom, through which I can still take part in my weekly Tai Chi lesson, have meetings with my family who are in Paris and London and meet up with friends who we've not seen for quite a long time! I don't use Facebook really, but am a great fan of Instagram and Twitter, both of which have been great for distraction and education. Shopping and food This has been slightly challenging, though we've not been as badly affected as some people, because I always keep a big stock of food etc as a general habit, and was particularly well stocked this year because we'd recently bought a chest freezer and filled it as a way of stock piling in advance of a no-deal Brexit which my husband was sure would happen and would lead to various shortages. We have a small M&S Simply Food shop in Warwick, which has been very well stocked with most things and is well organised as far as social distancing is concerned so I have been popping in there every now and then. Otherwise I have had vegetables delivered from one of the Warwick market stalls, and had deliveries from a small deli in town.  Now I have finally managed to work the Waitrose click and collect slot system and will be collecting my second big grocery shop this weekend! Our eating habits haven't changed greatly but I seem to be thinking much more about what I will cook each day and whether I've got the necessary ingredients. We are, however, drinking more wine – particularly as each evening comes we are left despairing by the news or the government briefing, and the only solution seems to be to have a glass or more of wine! Entertainment and Leisure I'm afraid I have been pretty idle during the lockdown so far. I haven't learned any new skills, but have been doing things I normally do to a greater or lesser degree, such as knitting and tapestry. At the beginning I found it hard to concentrate enough to read (very frustrating as I am usually a great reader) but now I find the habit is returning and I have been able to take pleasure in reading again. A particular favourite book has been the latest biography of the Beatles “One Two Three Four The Beatles in Time” by Craig Brown. It is a fascinating overview of the 60s decade and the Beatles part in it. We haven't done much film or tv watching of any particular note, apart from two films starring Jeff Bridges, both of which we've seen before but which we thoroughly enjoyed ­“Come Hell or HighWater” and the remake of “True Grit”. I have watched one or two art programmes on iPlayer such as a BBC programme which Michael Palin made on the Danish painter Hammershoi.  I have been continuing to listen to my favourite pod casts, the ones I have enjoyed most are “Older and Wider” with Jenny Eclair and Judith Holder, “Fortunately” with Jane Garvey and Fi Glover and “Backlisted” the books podcast by John Mitchinson and Andy Miller. I find podcasts particularly helpful in bed at night. We have been doing a couple of jigsaws and have been sowing seeds and plants and raising seedlings for a vegetable garden. I have been doing some exercise most days – but probably not enough. I walk round town for half an hour or so about 5 days out of 7. Personal Hygiene My habits regarding this haven't really changed. I tend to stay longer in bed in the morning than I would have done before, and sometimes don't change out of my night clothes until late morning, after a shower, but I have continued to wear makeup most days and attempt to make my hair look ok, though that is getting more and more difficult since I cannot get to a hair dresser to have my hair cut! This is going to be more and more distressing as the time goes on, I'm sure – but there's no alternative other than getting my husband to cut it, which I really don't fancy! Sleep My sleep, surprisingly, hasn't been too badly affected by the situation.  In fact, generally speaking I think I'm sleeping a bit better than usual.  I have had a couple of nights which were filled with nightmares, which I found rather distressing, and which affected me during the day afterwards, but otherwise I have no real problem, so far.  If I do find it hard to get to sleep, or if I wake in the night and can't go back to sleep I tend to listen to my podcasts and find them very helpful, just to prevent my mind wandering somewhere where I don't w a n t t"

Mass-Observer V3773 describes themself as female; age 56; co-habiting; 'NHS Clinical Coder, ex-bookseller, Psychology graduate'.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","Mass Obs  Spring 2020 Directive  Part 2  COVID19 (Update) V3773 Female, 56, co-habiting in Solihull, NHS Clinical Coder, ex-bookseller, Psychology graduate By the end of March my employers had set me up with the computer equipment necessary for working from home.  I already suffered from a certain amount of anxiety before COVID-19 arrived, mostly caused by different work issues, past and present, and working from home seemed to heighten the anxiety acutely.  Although theoretically I can still ask questions of everyone or anyone from the work team, it’s a lot harder than just quietly asking the person next to me, especially for a moderately shy person who is not very quick at this particular job. Also when I went into work I used to have a bit of time away from my partner, especially the excellent me-time I had in the car, between home and work. And of course I shared some of the anxieties that most people have presumably been going through, having had their routines taken away and other things they took for granted, such as different ways of shopping, unavailability of basic items, and not being able to visit loved ones, and so on. I haven’t been particularly scared of the virus on my own account, but I have been scared about my parents getting it, or of people targeting them with new scams relevant to the new situation.  As it happens, I had already been on a local waiting list to talk to a CBT therapist about anxiety, months before anyone had ever heard of COVID, and had talked to another psychologist at work, so the telephone appointments I had with therapists during lockdown didn’t occur as a result of COVID.  However, I think that my heightened state of anxiety, especially once working at home, made it even more difficult for them to make much impact. They have given me a few pointers and tools for self-help, but the thing that has made a practical difference has been the mild anti-anxiety medication I asked my GP for, a few weeks ago.  I now feel exactly the same as I did before, except my brain doesn’t panic and freeze when I’m faced with a new difficulty, and I am less inclined to obsess over perceived problems. I wish I’d tried it a long time ago.  My emotions in the last few weeks have still been of mild anxiety, and also of course confusion about the changing rules.  Strangers have been allowed into people’s homes to do work whilst close family members haven’t (and many other frustrating paradoxes). I feel impatient and irritated about political decisions that have been made, turning down an EU offer to help with PPE supplies, only seeing things from the perspective of the privileged, well-to-do population, and rarely the difficulties that other significant sectors of the population might have, and blaming others for failures. And let’s not get started on the ignoring of distancing rules, and visits to second homes, and so on!  I briefly wondered whetherBoris’s perspective towards the NHS and foreign workers may have changed, after his thank you speech about the care he received when he was so ill, but I had my doubts, and it turns out I was right to be sceptical. I think it’s madness to have so much foreign travel allowed now without quarantine or self-isolation. I read that New Zealand had cleared itself of it until two women travelled there from the UK, and although they were initially in quarantine, they applied for compassionate exemption (to see a dying relative).  The necessary testing wasn’t done, and they re-introduced COVID-19 into New Zealand. You ask what steps I think the British Government will make in the coming months – I have taken a while to write my response, so it is now clear that they want us back to normal business as soon as possible. I do understand that they worry about the economy, and people losing jobs, and so on, but they kept saying it would depend on things like the R rate, whereas I think they’ve pretty much ignored any warning factors and just ploughed ahead regardless. It is difficult to know exactly the right thing to do, though.  It’s interesting that some pubs have closed again because of positive tests.  I suppose that’s the way we have to play it – be cautious by area (like Leicester), depending on what is going on locally. I don’t seek out news, but I have BBC News on mytablet and phone. It sends me headline alerts but I don’t take much notice, rarely inspired to click on a banner to find out more.  It’s usually more of the same.  Most of the updates on what we can or can’t do feel as though they’re not very relevant to me –we don’t go out much (pubs, restaurants, gyms), and I don’t have children.  I’m moreinterested in when I should visit my parents (haven’t yet), Marcus Rashford’s campaign for free meals for children, and the Black Lives Matter events. That sort of thing, but not much of the COVID updates. My partner often tells me about news headlines that pop up, but I don’t encourage it. For a few weeks we watched the 5pm updates every day for a few weeks, but again, it got very samey, and the journalists’ questions got irritating, especially “When are you going to allow…?” when the answer was always going to be that they were playing it by ear, and listening to the scientists’ recommendations.  (Whether or not they are still listening is another matter.)  We don’t even watch the six o’clock news, though I suppose we would if we didn’t have updates pinging into our devices all the time.  I don’t know anyone who’s experienced challenges with access to the news.  It’s right that there should be BSL interpreters for the briefings – the real-time subtitles for live TV reports are not always accurate or helpful. The work systems on the computer are much slower at home, so those of us who are in that position don’t manage to get quite as much work done as the core group that still goes into the office (and socially distances and wear masks outside the office because it’s a hospital).  I have mentioned the anxiety attached to working from home in the first section.  Every morning at the same time, the team have a Microsoft meeting, and to begin with I really resented having to stop my work especially if Iwas on a roll, but now I’m more used to it, and it’s sort of nice to see other people, and if I’m having a bad hair day (I experimented several weeks ago with cutting layers.  The results weren’t disastrous but they weren’t great.) I don’t have to activate the camera.  We also have a WhatsApp group both for work queries and the occasional social chat. I do find it harder to focus on my work, though it’s nice to be able to have lunch in the garden, and cuddle the cat from time to time, and be somewhere where I’m totally comfortable with my environment (bit shy and awkward sometimes, with my current colleagues).  I can be a little bit flexible, and on one occasion, when I was very tired, I was able to have a full hour’s lunch so I could have a short kip, and worked half an hour later in the afternoon.  If I need to work a bit later to finish a piece of work, I don’t then have to contend with peak hour traffic. Marvellous! I still have to work my regular hours, so when shopping was more difficult, with vast queues and empty shelves, I wasn’t able to spend ages, or go mid-afternoon when it was quieter.  I used the NHS half-hour on Saturdays for a couple of shops, but found it very stressful, keeping my distance, and announcements telling everyone to get to the checkouts as quickly as possible so they could let more people in. One colleague said she thought that the NHS half hour should be reserved for front line workers, and I had wondered about that, but because I was working for the NHS (and still having to travel to work for at least the couple of weeks of lockdown), I was still having to work full-time, and didn’t have enough flexibility in my hours to queue during the week, and I wasn’t going to spend my day off in a queue, especially as I was already struggling with life/work balance.  Thecolleague who’d said that was on part-time hours anyway, so she wasn’t as restricted as to when she could go. My partner now does some of the shopping on foot, because he doesn’t drive but has more time at his disposal, and also he helps his Mum with her shopping every two weeks, and can get the heaviest items then, because she drives.  He is at home all the time except when he nips round for an hour or two, once or twice a week to help his parents, but I am usually working at that time, and don’t feel the benefit of having the house to myself.  He’s easy enough to get along with, but like most couples or families, I could do with time to myself, when I’m not working. I really feel for those who have been confined, for example, to a small flat, without a garden, not being able to get away from the family, and even more for people who live with abusive partners or family members.  I have mentioned that we have daily Microsoft meetings at work, and I have also used it to have the occasional chat with my manager.  My family have also started using Zoom once a week, I think mostly for the benefit of my parents, who each live on their own.  My brother, also working from home, has it free because of his work, so the family is able to talk for an hour or so, and since my siblings and I ordered Dad some headphones, he can hear us better and doesn’t get tired so quickly.  We also keep in touch on a family WhatsApp group, although we were doing that before COVID came along.  It’s made a hell of a difference to everyone, as a convenient way to keep in touch. My sister is a music teacher, and has been teaching her pupils by video link, although of course it must be much more difficult for all teachers, let alone a teacher of a musical instrument, to teach by video link.  The colleague I’m closest to, my former mentor, is now trying to mentor the three newest newbies by Microsoft Teams, and she finds that much harder than face to face discussion.  I haven’t had more time for social media, but I did notice a big increase in activity on Facebook, since some friends had so much more time on their hands.  I have started following more people on Twitter, not because I have more time – I haven’t – but because I’m trying to find people who make cheerful reading.  I have unfollowed people who are heavily political and skim past people making very critical points about government and social situations (although I quite often share their views), and really just want to read witty and observational things that make me smile – not quite so much down the route of cute animal videos, heart-warming stories of people being selfless or worthy, uplifting philosophies (yuck). I still follow Have I Got News For You tweets, but unfortunately they don’t seem to have much new material to work with at the moment. Iwasn’t that interested in the shops opening because I will probably avoid using them as much as possible anyway, because it’s going to be a very long-winded process, and even in the old normal, I always used to give up quite quickly if I wasn’t enjoying a productive shop. And it’s not going to be the same if you can’t just mooch around, picking things up and putting them down.  Cooking and eating has stayed the same as far as possible.  My partner prepares the main meal of the day, and is not as open as many people to trying new things.  He knows where he is with the current repertoire, and knows he likes it.  Of course we have had to try new brands of stuff (e.g. rice), which of course have turned out fine, except for the jars of very oily sauce we had to resort to, for cooking the chicken, but now we can get the regular sauces again.  Phew!  Haven’t had to order food online –again, my partner is a creature of habit, and we’ve got by using the usual local supermarket. My Dad was already ordering his frozen meals from Wiltshire Farm Foods or something like that, and he has a very good friend nearby who was able to get him milk and bread and things.  We are all so grateful to this friend. A local stranger offered to get shopping for the sheltered residents on the same estate, and I was immediately defensive.  Although there was a big thing about the new NHS volunteers staying safe, I was more worried that unscrupulous people would be able use the guise of helpful volunteer to gain access to vulnerable individuals.  It turns out that Dad’s local stranger was actually known to the management of Dad’s accommodation, and part of a local help group, but I don’t think he needed to use her anyway, partly due to his local friend.  Mum, however, found it extremely difficult to get a delivery slot.  She couldn’t get one with her regular supermarket, despite them saying they were prioritising the elderly and vulnerable (she’s in her mid-eighties, but I don’t think has anyof the “vulnerable” conditions). For several weeks, a neighbour added Mum’s items to her own delivery order, which she had already been receiving for months, so was in the system, and then eventually Mum got a delivery slot with a different supermarket from the one she used to use. Haven’t had any spare time, and I already had a list of things I would like to do if I had the time – getting work done on the house, more cleaning and tidying, gardening, playing my keyboard (or guitar or the other thing), investigating my pension (see if I can afford to leave this job), beginning to prepare for the two exams I’m supposed to take next March.  Iwas supposed to take them March 2020, but they were rescheduled for September, then they were rescheduled again.  If I had lost my job, I might also have continued learning the language I had been studying before I got this job.  (Duolingo is good, with its interactive element and bite-sized chunks.) I have been enjoying some of the entertainment that has had to work around lockdown, for example Have I Got News For You, and some of the fun that musicians and others have had creating humorous videos for YouTube. I finally took the plunge and subscribed to Netflix (who don’t give you a free month any more sinceDecember – they must have known lockdown was on the way!) so we have a little more variety of stuff to watch, now that various productions have had to be put on hold.  I loved the 15-20 minute-per-episode series Staged, with Michael Sheen, David Tennant and others, where they are playing themselves trying to prepare/rehearse for a play, via video-link.  I found their banter funny, and I have watched it twice. My personal hygiene hasn’t changed in recent months.  The only thing might be that I used to wear a fresh top to the office every day, and now it’s every few days, but apart from that, nothing’s changed.  If anything, I perhaps give skin care slightly more attention.  Seems slightly more convenient at the moment, and I did get a chance to sort out my bedroom drawers and see what products I had, that I hadn’t been using. My sleep has been much the same as always, though I’ve actually slept a little better recently, since starting anti-anxiety medication.  I still seem to have to listen to podcasts as I go to sleep, in order to distract me from my regular worries, which tend to involve my family or whetherI’ve offended anyone by saying the wrong thing, somehow. I am very grateful that my worries don’t include losing my job, or, so far, any close friends or relations having contracted the coronavirus.  I don’t think I’ve dreamt about either the illness or the changed situation in which we find ourselves."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. I have been in lockdown with my wife and we have both been working from home. We have both been fine apart from the occasional feeling of frustration. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I have required no help. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? They have been very much up and down. On one hand I have enjoyed the good weather and being out in the garden and walking has lifted my mood. At other times I have felt a bit low as trying to work remotely has not been very easy for me and it has been frustrating at times. Also plans I have had have had to be put on hold which has been difficult. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I am using the BBC news on the television and online versions of the BB news and various newspapers. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I have been watching them but have recently stopped watching them as I feel that they are a waste of time. There is so much repetition and old news spoken that I find it annoying and frustrating. The health professionals do though speak clearly and well. It is mainly the politicians who spend their time pontificating and trying to avoid saying anything of import. Boris Johnson particularly is so full of bluster. The questions also seem to be repetitive and sometimes even unproductive. We are where we are, more importantly how are we going to get out of it. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I personally have had no problems accessing the news. I would be happy for subtitles/Sign language to be used if it means more people can access the information. I have occasionally caught the Scottish briefings and think they are much better than the Downing Street ones. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I have been working during the lockdown, but I have been working from home. I am fortunately still being paid by my employer. My experience of working from home has been mixed. For 8 weeks I had nothing to do but online courses which began to wear thin. However recently I have been able to do some “proper” work and this feels much better. I have also been having twice daily meetings with my colleagues which helps a lot as I miss being around them. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with?  How have you managed these challenges? It is just been my wife and I in the house as out children have left home. Home life has been much as normal during the working week as we have been both working. In fact it has been quite nice to have a tea break with my wife. The main issue for us has been the inability to be able to see our three children and two grandchildren. We have missed seeing them and although zoom is good it doesn’t replace real meetings. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I have been doing quite a bit of zoom with our children and friends which has been welcome as a way of keeping in contact. My monthly book group have moved to zoom. It has been good to have this continue and in fact a past member who recently moved has been able to join us which has been nice. I have also used facetime/WhatsApp video calls to talk with my brother who is in a stressful situation at the moment. It has been good to see his face and I hope our chats have been good for him. Zoom meetings are definitely not as good as face to face and quite difficult at first. I think now we are all experts! One of my grandchildren (7) refuses to join any family videos though. I think he is really missing us and seeing our faces, but as we are physically not in the room, would only upset him. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I use Facebook but not really much more than I do normally. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Initially food shopping was very difficult as there was not much available and I, like may other people I suspect, tended to buy things when I saw them and more than I needed. I tended to go shopping more often than I normally would just to pick up things. Now the food shops are much better I have reverted to my routine of a once a week shop at a supermarket. There seem to be no shortages of anything now. There are sometimes queues to get in but they are never very large and once in everyone seems well behaved and the supermarkets have done a good job. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? For us things have mainly remained the same. We did used to go out for a meal every couple of weeks but this hasn’t been happening. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? I have been doing much more gardening which I have been enjoying and also getting though my list of jobs to do. Inspired by a next-door neighbour my wife and I have sanded and oiled all our garden furniture. We are very proud of the excellent results. I am defiantly spending more time outside and have been doing daily walks which I have really enjoyed. So I think I am definitely getting more exercise than I used to. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. Whilst working I have been listening to radio 3 which I have enjoyed. When I return to work, I’ll probably be taking some earphones to listen there. On television we have mainly been following the same pattern of watching things on catchup rather than live TV. I have watched things like Devs, After life, Grace and Frankie, Gogol, History of England. I have also really enjoyed watching the last series of Springwatch. It is not normally something my wife would watch but she has become an avid watcher too. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My habits of washing and personal care have not been any different during this period. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I normally sleep very well and in the main I have continued to. I have had the occasional bad night with bad dreams as I suspect I am affected by the change in circumstance and worry. But it has not been excessive, rather occasional. My wife’s sleeping has been mainly the same as it is normally as well. I think I have been dreaming more than normal. I can’t remember any details now of them but do remember that I do normally remember them during the day after."
