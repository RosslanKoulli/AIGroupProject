Returning to ‘normality’ has not been good. I really liked the quiet, no cars, peace of Covid, to walk in the country and not be able to hear traffic. Obviously, it was really good for the environment but now the roads are packed, cities are packed it is just horrible. Returning to work. I mainly work from home anyway but one of my clients needed staff coverage and I have been working in an office environment since March. By the end of December, they will probably no longer need me. Initially, I liked it being back in the buzz of business but then got to hate it. I much prefer working from home. Rising energy bills I have told my supplier I shall be sitting wrapped in a blanket with no heating on this winter as my bills have doubled. Goodness knows how poor people are going to manage, I am sure there is going to be even more deaths of elderly people as they will not be able to afford to hear their homes. Some of the major companies have gone bust which is a shock. Red Poppy I am so pleased we are still remembering this and we need to continue to do so. It will get harder as the survivors die off but of course, it is not just about the famous wars but about all the armed forces. Murder of Sir David Ames This was a shock. A man doing his job, exhibiting kindness seemingly killed for no reason. Owen Paterson and Government U-Turn In my view, Boris Johnson has completely lost it. He is just doing one bad thing after another, I always thought he is a buffoon and he is definitely demonstrating this recently. I have no faith in him at all. HRH Prince Andrew – Lawsuit I think we all know he did it, what a shame for the Queen. A difficult one though. Can you imprison a member of the Royal family? I think you can, but I am guessing when it finally goes to court that won’t happen. Page4"

My emotions have been mainly up in the past few weeks. I believe this is because I have lived on my own for 24 years and also worked a lot from home, so the lockdown did not affect me as much as others. I am missing my family and friends but keeping in touch by Zoom and phone. The Government I believe the government, especially Boris, has done their best to cope with this extraordinary situation. There have been some mistakes but they are doing their best to correct them. Boris is very sensibly taking advice from all to assist is his decision making, unlike idiotic Trump who just bullies everybody, ignores their advice and does what he wants. The proposed steps are a slow return to work using social distancing and possibly masks trying to avoid another outbreak which seems fine to me. Using an app to assist in contact tracing etc. Hopefully, a vaccine will be found which will help and immunity will build up and by this time next year everything should be back to nearly normal….except of course the economy will be a disaster, there will be so many people unemployed and businesses in administration. News I watch the BBC News at 6pm every day to get an update of the current situation. I watch some of the daily press broadcasts at 5pm when I feel they are important, e.g. when Boris returned to work and thankfully, said he was going to continue the lockdown. I do not know of anyone who has challenges with access to the news. I find the BSL interpreters distracting but of course, were I deaf, I would love them. I am ambivalent about the use of them but can see how helpful they would be to the 11 million deaf people in the UK to know what is going on in their country and to be honest am surprised they are not used by the British Government. I know this is contradictory, but it is how I feel. L7499 Work and Home Life On the day lockdown was announced, I lost all my work. As a Virtual Assistant I work for a variety of different clients, all of whom decided to stop so my income stopped then. I had to apply for benefits for only the second time in my life (I had to when I was a single parent) but it is much easier now as you can apply online and it only took a month for it to be sorted. My home life has remained the same other than I have no work but still sit at my PC every morning as I am doing various courses and writing like now! I go for more walks as I have the time. I call my friends rather than seeing them and Zoom with my brothers. I speak to my neighbours when I see them, social distancing being easy as there is a path and lawn between us. I am also a member our village society and administer the website and Facebook page so am always adding posts to that mainly regarding Covid-19. We were going to have a Zoom AGM but a couple of the members can’t/won’t do Zoom so not sure how we will handle that! Technology As I mentioned above, I do use technology, none of it new to me as I was using it previously. I am using Zoom more and Facebook to update the village re fraud and scams as we are members of the Neighbourhood Watch scheme and they send us updates for me to post. I use Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram (a bit) WhatsApp a lot, Zoom and Facebook with ease and there have been no challenges for me. To use a phrase I like, I am technologically aware! Shopping and Food There have been challenges with this especially due to the idiotic people stockpiling for no reason. However, this seems to have settled down now. Unfortunately, I do not like going shopping because I have to be near people as the aisles are not wide enough. Our local Co-op has only recently created a one-way system and only so many in the supermarket. Our local Tesco has been doing this for a while and only allowing so many customers in at once. I am thinking that if this goes on too long, we will all become agoraphobic and not want to go out! My eating habits have mainly remained the same as I do like to cook for myself. Entertainment and Leisure I had started a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy course in January and not done much of it. Now I am concentrating on it but I am finding it quite challenging. I am also on Google Digital Garage doing some courses there. I have been writing a story about my time spent in Libya in the late seventies for years so am working on that too. might get it finished eventually… I do like documentaries so have recently watched Influenza: 1918 which was remarkably interesting, a lot like Covid but even more L7499 deadly! OJ; Made in America which I watched previously but watched again as it was so engrossing. One on Buster Keaton and others. I absolutely cannot stand shows where they are interviewing people on Zoom or similar. To me that is not a proper programme, so I avoid them. I have also gone back to learning Spanish on Duolingo and was surprised at how much I remembered as I have not done it for at least a year. Have done my usual spring clean in bits. I also play the drums sort of so go into my garage and play them (electronic so as not to disturb my neighbours) plus I have a small keyboard in my office (my grandson’s) which I play occasionally. I have also started sketching again and am planning to paint although I am rubbish at it. I am considering doing some photography but my mobile phone probably takes better images than my camera. I have also worked on the village website and my own in the hope of gaining work again once lockdown is over. Watched a lot of films, recently, The Butterfly Effect, Sleeping with Enemy, What I did on my Holidays, The Lone Ranger, Rush -all of which I had already seen but watched again because I enjoyed them. I started The Game but remembered I didn’t like it. I have recorded Notorious which is from 1946 so not sure I will be able to watch it. Downloaded BBC Sounds app but not listened to anything yet. I do use Google mini and Alexa a lot for info and the latter to play quizzes and games. I also play a lot of games on my phone, mainly word games, Scrabble, Crosswords and card games. Personal Hygiene This has remained the same other than washing my hands more thoroughly. Sleep My sleep has improved if anything as often I would go to bed with things on my mind and only sleep for 6 hours. Now I don’t really have anything to worry about so sleep for 7 hours or more! I know in reality I should be worried that I won’t get work and so on but I have decided in that case I will retire as I am 70 later this year and think I have worked enough. I have enjoyed this chance to relax and do the things I want; I feel rested and happy. I can understand, of course, the real worries for families, concern for how they are going to feed their children. There is going to be so many unemployed people once this is over and the economy is going to hell in a handcart so it is going to be a nightmare but If I have to, I will return my car, I have put myself on the housing register and I will move to a council home if necessary and manage. I rarely dream, although my daughter tells me I do dream but don’t remember them. So, I only occasionally remember a dream and they are L7499 weird and probably related to whatever is going on in my life at the time. Recently I have had none I can remember."

Pleased booster scheme has been rolled out but disappointed at slow uptake from a proportion of the population, especially those who have been bothered to go and get two vaccinations to stay safe but don’t feel that a third jab is for them – why not? As I write this on 4th February 2022, figures report 52.4 million people received 1st vaccination, 48.5 million their 2nd vaccination, yet only 37.4 their booster. . Returning to work in the workplace will certainly boost the economy for business and service providers in towns and cities, increase use of public transport but is hopefully done in such a way that employers are still willing to consider going forward a flexible way of working for employees. . On writing, mask wearing is no longer required on public transport or in shops etc. as of 27th January. Interestingly, and pleasingly for me, I notice so many people are still wearing their masks. Possibly they, like me, have weighed up the risks for themselves and in my case, the number of Covid cases was still extremely high in my area and I was happy to continue with mask wearing and probably still will for quite a while. . As for normality, what is normality now. I think for quite a while to come, people will establish their own normality based on attitude to risk, vaccination status, and that also all of us will live in a world where a new normality becomes established. Life will be determined as pre-Covid and post-Covid and we have a chance to establish a different, if not better way of living and being. Why go back to what we had when the world can move on in hopefully a more positive way. Energy: . While expecting energy bills to rise, as have so many costs in the past couple of years, I think the percentage increase being forecast for many householders is a lot higher than people might have expected. Yesterday the energy regulator Ofgem announced the price cap on energy would rise from April by £693, leading to many media reports about families being faced with the question of what they should spend their money on -food or fuel? I am lucky enough to be able to afford the increased costs but feel desperately for those who already live on the poverty line and for them, the increase, even with Government help, will still make life even more difficult. . When I investigated this a little, I read that 1/5 of the energy bill is in the control of the suppliers, the other part controlled by power suppliers and Governments through VAT and Green Energy surcharge schemes. I realise that the UK is not alone and wholesale prices are increasing all over Europe, affected by past weather conditions, lower gas supply from Russia and increased gas demand from Asia, especially China. It has been interesting to read what other European countries are doing to combat rising prices, and most have similar strategies in subsidies to households, subsidies to low-income earners and scrapping green energy surcharges. Interestingly, Greece have increased their national minimum wage by 2% and reduced by 13% their property tax, two measures that seem quite unique in Europe. France has ordered the energy supplier EDF to generate more nuclear energy, probably an easier move to make for that country as EDF is 80% Government owned. Spain have chosen as one of their measures to tax the increased profits of energy companies and it is this move I fear is missing from the UK Government’s raft of measures regarding the current energy price crisis. . I have listened twice on the radio to interviews with a representative from Citizens Advice Bureau who stated that currently they had been receiving one call every 40 seconds from people wanting advice in light of struggles with fuel debts, and it made me realise that so many people would get no help or assistance from their energy supplier and are having to turn to Citizens Advice. Maybe one thing to come out of this situation would be to reform how energy suppliers have to communicate with customers in trouble, and to enforce better schemes for assisting those customers in debt. . Some of the energy companies going bankrupt as a result of this crisis were smaller than I had envisaged, and while some of the larger, well-known suppliers deal with 100,000’s of customers, the smallest company I could seeing having gone bankrupt was Ampower who went out of business on 2nd November 2021 and supplied to 600 households. I was amazed to find that out of 70 energy suppliers at the start of 2021, maybe as few as 22 exist as I write. I am not aware of how much regulation is involved around setting up an energy company from scratch but when these businesses are supplying life sustaining goods and services to the population, more regulation initially would weed out the companies with no energy background or expertise, less financial backing and more likely to run into problems. Centenary of the Poppy: . Since childhood, I have known and recognized the red poppy as a symbol of remembrance, for those that died during wars. As I grew up, I became aware that beyond those that served, the red poppy also recognises civilian service and contributions, and acknowledges any civilians killed during conflict, or in situations arising from terrorism. I love the all-encompassing scope of the red poppy but also appreciate the symbolism of poppies of other colours. . White poppies, as well as recognising the dead, stand for peace, for those killed or imprisoned for refusing to fight and stopping the glorification of war. It was only when involved in a WW1 project from 2014-2019 that I read that the white poppy had been around for many decades, first having been thought of as a symbol as early as 1926. . Purple poppies commemorate the millions of animals that engaged in war, not of their choice, and so many lost their lives. I am aware that some people do not agree with the poppy symbol being attached to the concept of animal service but while I would not wear one, I have no issue in them being worn with pride by those that chose to do so. . As part of the research for the WW1 project, I read a book called ‘The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance and Redemption’ by Nicholas Saunders. I found it a fascinating dive back through the history and significance of the poppy, going back into Greek, Roman and Egyptian times, and then all the way through to conflict in Afghanistan connected to opium poppies. The book made me recognise the intrinsic value of this flower in many walks of life and re-emphasised the reason why I wear my red poppy each year with pride and hope to do so for many years to come. Murder of MP Sir David Amess: . As an MP, I am certain that you take on the role knowing that one of the key ways to understand the concerns of your constituents is to meet them and to communicate with them in person in your constituency. Since the murder of MP Jo Cox in 2016, the UK has been made very aware of the risks this entails for people in these publicly elected roles. Four other MPs were murdered before Jo Cox (Ian Gow, Anthony Berry, Robert Bradford and Airey Neave), seemingly all incidents connected to people fighting Irish republicanism causes. Certainly, with Jo Cox and David Amess, it appears that they were not murdered for who they were as individuals, but more for being representatives of an establishment and Government that the murderer felt aggrieved with. And while no MP should have to take on their role and be in fear of their life, I am certain it is something that is in the back of their minds at all times. . It was heart warming to hear the almost instant tributes to him from all across the Houses of Parliament, and wonderful that parliamentarians of all parties can unite when they need to, just a shame it had to be over something so tragic as David Amess’s death. What came across was how much he had achieved in his career as an MP and that his years in Westminster had been about serving his constituency, not just trying to further his own career. There must be more MP’s like him that never make the newspaper headlines, and it is a shame that we do not hear more of his ilk, and their important contributions to life in the UK. . The recognition of his many years of campaigning for Southend on Sea to be awarded city status came only three days after his death when the Queen agreed for the city status to be given. It was a wonderful decision but saddened to think that the man who had been behind this campaign for so long would never be aware of its success. I like to think the city status was awarded for what Southend on Sea has become over the time it had David Amess backing it, and not just as a reaction to his death. Conduct of Owen Paterson and Government U-turn: . An investigation found him in breach of parliamentary rules regarding consultancy work he undertook as well as his MP role. A 30-day suspension was recommended by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, he felt the investigation had not been fair but then through various means, parliament were asked to vote on whether the investigation process needed to be overhauled and his suspension should be ‘suspended’. Whether or not Owen Paterson is guilty of the charges against him, the controversy that broke out in the following couple of days was an embarrassment, a sign of a political party trying to save one of their own, and when the Government made a U-turn against the motion they had instructed a three-line whip on, for me it just added to a current crop of incidents where I question whether those in power know what they are doing. . I feel for Owen Paterson and his family that out of all this controversy, he feels a contributing factor to his wife’s suicide was in some way the pressure they found themselves under during the investigation and media scrutiny. I would not wish the loss of a relative on any family group, least of all by suicide, but his personal loss should not negate the investigation proceeding. . It might be that this case throws up the inconsistencies in the processes used by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and I would be all for a review of those processed using any factually correct information from the Paterson case being used as reasons for change. Duke of York lawsuit: . It is important to remember that he is an individual man being linked this case, and his titles and royal status should not interfere with the factual information that is known so far about the case. . Due to his royal status, what is presented via the media is a mix of fact, media speculation and comments from interested others. It is key that fact and speculation are separated and that as in any legal case or court of law, innocence is presumed until being found guilty. . While not aware of facts that could lead me to comment about his alleged part in the Epstein/Maxwell dealings, I cannot ignore his lack of sensitivity for the alleged victims in his BBC interview. I feel he was badly advised to take part in the interview and was possibly going it would be a way to clear his name, yet that should happen under legal circumstance and not as part of some media documentary/interview. . The fallout for him personally has been wide-ranging and I do wonder whether, even if cleared of any wrong doing, he will never be accepted again in the same way in public life, not because of what he was alleged to have done but because of his poor handling of the situation afterwards. Similar to many controversies surrounding Boris Johnson, the current Government and the No 10 establishment, it is not just about what happened – it is about how you conduct yourself afterwards – ideally with honesty and integrity. There are hard facts behind this case, yet his attitude and behaviour about it are all of his own making, there is no-one else to blame for his lack of judgement and sensitivity to those concerned."

I had to drive to the urgent treatment centre in the nearest hospital in order to have it extracted. The ‘operation’ took aminute and I waited onlyfive minutes. But it was alittle unnerving tomix with people for the first time for weeks even though there were relatively few day patients around. My underlying conditions – low level diabetes, risk of heart atrial fibrillation, tendency to high blood pressure and mild COPD are largely managed with medication. During the crisis, however, I have been told by my GP practice not to attend the surgery for routine appointments or monitoring tests which have been placed on hold until the lockdown ends. My one current problem is the sudden deterioration in my hearing which makes conversation and, especially, using the phone all the more difficult – and increases the sense of isolation. Just before the lockdown, I planned appointments to have this seen to but now I have to wait until normality returns. My emotions vary. Being almost totally isolated, as instructed by the NHS, due to age and underlying medical conditions, does, inevitably, induce feelings of loneliness and anxiety and sometimes lethargy. Most of the time I manage to cope by keeping busy or diverted and keeping in touch with family and friends by email and text etc. My emotions are, though, still affected by grief over the death of my wife of 50 years about three years ago. The sense of her absence makes isolation all the harder to live with. If we were still together, we would have found isolation much easier, even though we might have worried about each other, other people and the state of the world. We could have found enjoyment in doing things together and just securityin each other’s presence. Enjoyment and joy – very much in short supply these days. Increasing age doesn’t help either. I suppose this all amounts to a mild form of depression but at least I know why that is – it is not an inherent condition. And it helps a little to know that I am isolating to keep myself as safe as possible and to help protect others. Iamdoing ‘my bit’. I was made doubly aware recently of the seriousness of Covid-19 and the danger it poses when for some reason (possibly stress caused by technology) I suddenly felt hot and feared for a moment thought it could be the virus. Thankfully, when I checked mytemperature with aforehead thermometer, Ilearned that it was normal. Maybeit was nature’s way of reminding me to stay indoors. The Government It seems strange how a small news report about a virus outbreak in one part of a large country thousands of miles away (in January I think) has suddenly taken over and threatened and disrupted our lives. It seems that is often the unexpected dangers, the ones from the blind side, that cause the most harm. Certainly, the government didn’t see this one coming. During the early period when the virus began to spread, the government was still obsessed with leaving the European Community (‘Getting Brexit done’) and were late in the dayin taking action. The crisis has brought brough problems which would be almost insurmountable for any government but the present Tory administration could have done and could still do much better. We have not been well served, compared with other countries like Germany and South Korea. It is difficult to know where to start. I suppose with the fact that a wiser prime minister than a narcissist who thought that it was enough to sound like Churchill, instead of acting like him, would have chosen a more talented and less subservient cabinet. A better government would have coordinated public information more tightly so that the vital information it gave out was more consistent and less confusing. And an over reliance on saying that they are led by the science brushes over the fact that, as is necessary, scientists do not always agree with each other. Praising the NHS every five minutes is no substitute for acting effectively and in a timely fashion and presenting care workers with a badge is insulting when they are among those most at risk and up to now the least protected. Other concerns are: . A contingency planning exercise in 2017 seems to have largely been ignored which has prevented adequate stockpiling of medical supplies and personal protection. . The plight of residents and staff in care homes, especially vulnerable, has been virtually ignored until recently resulting in a high death rate which could have been prevented. . Anearlybeliefin the theoryof ‘herd immunity’ (allowing less vulnerable people to be infected and to mix so that they helped spread immunity) delayed the onset of social distancing measures, lagging behind other countries. . An inability to initiate testing for the virus early enough. . Confusion and inconsistency in the selection of ‘vulnerable’ people for ‘shielded’ isolation (as I am when I know older people than me with more serious conditions have not been selected) . The earlier cuts to health and social care funding of previous Tory administrations. As a result, the UK has recorded the highest total death rate in Europe (as I write we have just topped 30,000) and almost in the world. And, the UK economy and all local communities will suffer all the more damage. I think the government has now realised what is at stake and is probably acting in a more coherent and cautious manner. They have to find a way to balance managing the social distancing policy with the desperate need to re-start the economy. Relaxing the former too soon could risk the spread of the virus starting up again, forcing a second lockdown. But delaying economic regeneration too long could do even greater damage to the long term economic and social fabric of the country than it has already done. And if course, continue to increase the huge cost of supporting business and workers and the enormous public financial debt. It will not have helped to have left the European Community, of course – international cooperation has never been more needed. Now the government has their eye on the ball at last, I think (or maybe hope) that they will manage to restore normality gradually, using sound information and advice. News I read The Guardian daily – as I have done for 60 years and often monitor the news on the various news websites on my i-phone. In addition, I watch BBC News bulletins and their news channel almost obsessively. It is depressing but not so depressing and anger inducing as the daily TV news briefings on BBC TV which do little but to demonstrate the inadequacies of a singularly weak set of cabinet ministers. Most of what is said by government representatives is little more than cliché and waffle, learned by rote almost. The useful element is usually the contribution of scientific and medical advisors and their visual aids. I know no-one who has trouble accessing the news but many who don’t watch the news because they feel it is too depressing. Having hearing impairment, I always use the subtitles and I find that adequate. I am not sure if signing is also essential but have an open mind. Work and Home Life Being long retired I don’t, of course, work but before the lockdown I spent a good deal of time as a volunteer: as a befriender to vulnerable people and as a trustee and secretary of a small charity. The befriending is suspended. I am still doing a little work for the charity with writing and editing policy documents and promotional literature and will be joining meetings via video conferencing (Zoom). Much of the work and information is conveyed by email. Home life has changed a good deal in that all life is confined to the home: no visits to friends and family, no outside walks, reliance for exercise on an exercise bike, no pub visits (though those were infrequent anyway), more watching TV, a little more reading. My world has shrunk. One significant change has been the evolution of a strict daily routine to get me through the day, based on meals, writing, emailing people, exercise and treats (tea and biscuits, coffee, wine). One problem which I know is common to a lot of people in isolation, is not knowing what day it is. To solve that I have just bought a digital clock which displays time, date, and day. Technology Before the lockdown, I was already using a variety of online technology: email, text, WhatsApp, and Instagram (the latter only for sharing photos with family members). I do not (and still do not use) Facebook, Twitter etc. A distant friend uses WhatsApp for a weekly video call but I have not yet attempted to find out how to use that. I am having to learn to use Zoom for the charity but have found it difficult so far – I am getting to my limit in learning new technology. It does not come naturally! Shopping and Food My daughter has been very helpful and brings me small amounts of food and other essentials (I originally moved to live near her but never imagined quite how useful that would be). And several friends have offered to get me things. But for most food I use the Iceland delivery service online. I do though have great trouble in finding available delivery slots. I am told that the time to do this is at or after midnight but that so far has been a step too far. I have never managed to find a Tesco delivery slot. Many local shops now deliver but have limited resources. If all fails, my daughter will add to her normal weekly shop for me. She has one of my bank cards to use or for cash. But I have a full freezer and most of the time a reasonably full food covered. I have had to learn how to plan my needs a week or two ahead. My cooking has not changed a good deal. I am vegetarian (with occasional fish and chips). I am not a keen cook and no longer use recipes though I have learned some basics from my late wife who was a superb veggie cook. For about three or four days’evening meals I make a large pan of pasta sauce or other mixture of vegetables, meat substitute (eg Quorn) with herbs etc and make it last with variations – eg with pasta, rice, potatoes. This saves time and trouble. Breakfast and lunch are still pretty minimal if healthy. I know that is all the wrong way round (breakfast should be larger, tea smaller) but habits stay fixed after many years. Entertainment and Leisure This area has taken the biggest hit, not necessarily because of the lockdown but since my bereavement. I have not felt able to do anything new – I have dabbled in many things in the past and most,thanks to mypermanent state of ‘aloneness’, I no longer have the motivation to attempt: poetry writing, painting and drawing. I do write in a notebook – ideas for poems which never come about or observations and, of course, Mass Observation writing which has been helpful in giving my writing a purpose. One new activity is entering writing and photography competitions, many for the over 70s in isolation. Photography is now limited by having to stay indoors, though I still take phone photos of skies and interior images and now and then have the chance to photograph birds in the adjacent trees. But I have always done that. DIY is now unnecessary: there are things in the flat I could improve but I can live without them – ‘its only me’. Ss already noted I try to stick to a session on my exercise bike every day now with some floor exercises – this as a substitute for daily walking around town. Myabilityto concentrate is now limited, even affecting myTV watching: if a programme doesn’t grip my attention then I’m off channel hopping, looking for something better or, like a teenager, looking at news or You Tube on my i-phone. But there are times when a programme holds me. One recent example which I have seen through twice is a new serial drama about the on/off love affair between two teenagers / students set in Ireland. SallyRooney’s ‘NormalPeople’ (adapted from her novel) has received critical acclaim and I can see why. The acting and direction and spare script are remarkable and sometimes almost make the viewer hold their breath. If this is still available in fifty years’ time, it maywell be a classic. I watched it twice in quick succession using the BBC iplayer catch up service on the digital TV. There are few programmes of that quality and the virus crisis has caused the creation of many new programmes to be suspended, meaning more repeats for the next year or so. Already I am seeking out older programmes but there is, frankly, a lot of dross to wade through to find the odd gem. Currently, as well was the BBC i-player, I have access to Netflix, More Four (Channel Four archive), ITV Hub and Amazon Prime. But most of what is on offer does not appeal. I have noticed that, during isolation, I am instinctively drawn less to crime dramas and more towards family dramas, even comedies – ‘people stories’, seemingly a kind ofsubstitute for meeting real people in the flesh. And subtitles are essential to catch all the dialogue. I do read a little more than I did before isolation, preferably sitting outside in the sun, though I often fall asleep! Day time reading is non-fiction: history, politics, biography, art etc. Friends have lent me books and I have returned the favour. I read novels, mainly on my Kindle e-reader in bed before trying to sleep. I can become lost in them. I have been reading a lot of books about bereavement – somehow this helps, especially in isolation, but reminding me that I am not alone in my experience ofgrief: one impressive novelin these lines is Sebastian Barry’s ‘Secret Scripture’, set in Ireland and centred on a 100 year-old woman in a mental hospital and the hospital director who has recently lost his wife. It reflects many of my feelings and experiences in losing my wife. Grief has become a fascinating subject recently. I no longer listen to radio since my hearing impairment makes this too much of a strain. Personal Hygiene In the light of health advice, I have been washing my hands more often and for longer. As a result the skin on my hands has aged, dry and creased! I now use a barrier cream to try to offset this. Just before the lockdown started, a friend advised me to get a haircut before it was too late. I managed this with a day or two to spare. It should last me another month at least – I try to keep it a little trim using an electric shaver. But I do not want to cut any more drastically than that. So, if I emerge from isolation with shoulder length hair, so be it. I have thought of growing a beard. I wore one for most of my working years and shaved it off, at mywife’s insistence when I retired, asymbolof a new life. But electric shaving is no trouble and is an entrenched habit so at present I will stick with the status quo. Sleep I have had sleep problems for several years – mainly waking up two or three times a night needing the toilet, as a result of an enlarged prostate. Bereavement has made this a little worse. And my hearing impairment makes listening to the radio with earphones, which used to help send me off again, less effective. There has been little difference in isolation – I can normally get between six and eight hours sleep (in instalments). I have recently developed a routine to help go to sleep initially – to read, then relax and then run through in my mind the events and activity of the previous day and what I need or want to do the following day. I tend to go to bed later now and sometimes I do sleep or doze late – with no incentive to get up. But I think most of this is common to a lot of people. I rarely remember dreams. Those I do recall – waking up in the middle -often feature my wife as if all is as it was. She is sometimes warning me about something or telling me something. So far, no nightmares though. But I have had such dreams ever since she died. Isolation has made little if any difference."

In the last few weeks he has begun an alcohol-reduction programme with a Bootle-based clinic, guided by weekly phone conversations with a supervisor. If he can become clear of alcohol, he will need mental health treatment. As well as most needing face-to-face alcohol-reduction meetings he’s also due an ultrasound scan on his liver, but neither are materialising. As a result of this long-brewing problem, we’ve lost our only full-time income and are both dependent on public allowances (Sick Pay for C. and Carer’s for me). I’ve also had to re-shoulder all main expenses through having the most savings. This, the reduction in private indoor space and the recent suicide of one of my elder brothers in Buckinghamshire are making me heavy in spirit. I’m too wearyof the Covid-19 issue to have much to write about it. Until a fortnight ago, I subscribed to gov.uk’s email updates and have otherwise heard of developments via Radio 4, Radio Merseyside and the i newspaper. Apart from expecting upheaval to last at least for the rest of the year, I can’t reallyguess the government’s near-future actions, especially as they probablydon’t know themselves. I’ve never watched the daily TV bulletins or ben inclined to, only acknowledging them if they bump something of interest off the schedules. I don’t know anyone with access problems to the news and don’t have any myself, but BSL news interpreters would be a good move. The preliminary MO questions about lockdown life asked about amusing media I’ve come across. My favourites were the BBC’s stay-at-home reminders, specifically Miranda Hart conducting a vegetable orchestra; a picture in the Mirror of a large bowler-hatted Harris Lego man whose hands are in a washing machine (which we’ve put on our bathroom door) and a life insurance advert on Pick showing a worker at his laptop on the dining table, top half in office clothes and bottom half in boxers and oversized fluffy shark slippers. I haven’t formally written much at all during lockdown and not submitted anything for publication. As mentioned above, the main impactor on home life has been C.’s sick-leave. He is a chef at a clinic, so would otherwise have been going out to work through the lockdown. I’m no more techie now that before lockdown, so am continuing my usual use of a laptop for internet browsing, BBC iplayer and email communication. I’ve only heard of Zoom during lockdown when C. has taken part in Sunday quizzes with family members and a Britain Talks 2 discussion on it. WhatsApp has also come to my attention during radio programmes, but no specific context for it has stood out to me. I do use Facebook, but no more than usual (once or twice a week). Apart from strong wholemeal flour, I’ve not had any long-term difficulties in getting groceries. A downside has been using card to pay small amounts, another direct knock to my funds, when I have enough change and no belief that a grubby card-reader is more hygienic than coins to share with others. The only online food service I have used during lockdown, Hodmedod’s British organic flour and pulse producers, had full availability for the items I ordered, which were dispatched and delivered very quickly. I have not changed my eating or cooking habits. My daily occupations have not changed significantly, nor have my watching/reading/listening preferences. The only addition to my hobbies is beginning a jigsaw with C. My personal hygiene care is as diligent as usual and I and others around me have not experienced any lockdown-related sleep probems. 3"

PART 3. CURRENT EVENTS. I am a 54 year old woman. I am married to another woman. I live in a small village in the Saddleworth area near Oldham. I am a retired Detective Police Officer. Current event topics. COVID BOOSTERS. I am waiting to get my booster next week. I couldn't book it until 5 months after my second and when I did log on the earliest date will be the 6 month deadline. i would have had it earlier but there were no slots. In view of the new variant I,m even more worried and keen to have it. It also makes me worry that these new variants may breach vaccines and we will all be screwed. Things aren't normal but just before the new variant Omicron it was starting to feel a bit better. Now I feel pessimistic about the way things are going. I also think we are going to end up with another Christmas lockdown and it will be a last minute ,badly planned and communicated event AGAIN from the government. I think 18/12 is the announcement date. It will cause us problems as we are booked into a hotel to visit my wife 90 year old mum who has dementia . We had to cancel it last year and just went down to wales in the same day to see her. So i,m hoping we aren't locked down but i have a feeling we will be. I,m getting sick of it all now. Mostly because the communication and planning has been crap. ENERGY COST RISES. The recent rises are worrying ,especially for people struggling already or on tight budgets. I am lucky that I have no mortgage and my pension is enough so i can pay all my bills and have money over to live a decent life. I feel really sorry for anyone who is living cold ,especially kids or older people. Making choices between food,heating or paying the rent must be so stressful. I think energy poverty is such a tough thing . I think it should be a basic human right to live in a warm,dry home and have enough to eat. i read that the rising gas prices are the cause and it seems like Russia has some control to squeeze the price and supply to us and Europe in a very worrying way. There is also competing pressure that climate change needs us to reduce carbon fuel use massively but also have a system to provide energy. Also petrol prices are so high. I remember in the first lockdown it was about £1 a litre…now its about £1.50 . Thats a big difference especially for anyone on a budget and maybe driving a lot. The insulate Britain protesters really annoyed me because of their tactics ,deliberately blocking ambulances is disgusting. BUT…they have a valid point and as a country we should insulate homes properly. All new builds it should be mandatory and older homes need a refit strategy. If it was planned sensibly it could provide loads of jobs. I think we need a radical masterplan to totally change our energy plans for the immediate,mid term and long term . The red tape and boring plans need to be wiped and let the scientists and out of the box thinking put plans in place. Solar panel use,green energy in every industry. waste products used for other things and minimal waste in any process. We also need to not be hostage to any other country providing our power. we have seen that Russia can block it and the french have deliberately blocked our borders. We need to somehow be as self sufficient as possible. in the immediate term the government need to provide real financial help to people in need. They wasted millions on track and trace so when they want they have money. Tax big companies and target tax avoiders then use that cash for good. Get rid of the house of lords and use all their money . Then reduce the amount of MP,s to about 200 and use that as well. Charge high tariffs to any rich foreign investors buying property . 100 YEARS OF RED POPPY. I am very patriotic and find the poppy very moving. I think respect for it is waning and many younger people don't seem to care. That in my opinion is sad as they have too easily forgotten what people sacrificed.I always buy a new poppy each year and Christmas cards etc to support the legion. I always watch the remembrance service and find it very moving . MURDER OF MP DAVID AMESS. I thought the murder was shocking. It was a cowardly and evil thing to do especially in a church. the poor man was just doing is job and no one should die like that. They are vulnerable and in a difficult position as they need to speak to the constituents and hear their concerns but they need to be safe too. More concerns that yet another islamist terrorist has struck. Why was he in the country when he had been refused leave to remain 7 years ago . He had pretended to be Syrian and was actually Iraqi. he should have been deported as soon as his case was refused. So it begs the question how many more are there in his situation who have no right to be here and are spending years having shameless lawyers making endless appeals to frustrate the process and earn a fortune in legal aid whilst doing so.The immigration system is broken, It needs an immediate,dramatic overhaul and start deporting these people who should not be here as fast as humanly possible. Speed up assessments to allow genuine refugees asylum cases to be decided . They need to be honest and admit that there are thousands who don't fit asylum claim status but they are seeking a better life and are economic migrants. we can,t accept every person from every country who just fancies coming here to use all the health,education and benefits system because we are an island and ALL of our systems are already unable to function and provide care to people already here and people born here who are entitled to these systems. You can’t say this though as you will be immediately labelled as racist if you do. For me rules need to be followed . Every country has the right to decide who comes to their country. Will that person be a positive member of the society or do they pose any threat to the country. Will they be an added burden or a benefit all needs to be honestly assessed. I think politics is getting more hateful ,especially online. I wish they could all start being a lot more civil to each other. You can disagree with someone without being abusive. Angela Rayner saying Tory Scum just before the murder and repeatedly refusing to apologise didn't help and is an example of how toxic society is. She blamed Boris Johnson and said he had said wrong things so she would apologise for her behaviour if he apologised for his. 2 wrongs don,t make a right. I think all MP,s need a reset and should treat others the way they would like to be treated and their behaviour needs to Improve massively. They do not do themselves any favours fiddling expenses,lying,having affairs breaking rules etc. Today I read that the speaker is calling in the police as they tested the toilets in Parliament and the majority swabbed positive for cocaine, That is appalling . How can they be making our law when they're high on coke. Unbelievable. Having said that it doesn't excuse the murder but if they behaved better it would set an example. I expect their security needs to be increased or changed . Nothing seems to have improved or been learned from since Jo Cox. CONDUCT OF OWEN PATERSON AND GOVERNMENT U TURN. Another example of bad conduct by an MP. They get paid a very large salary and expenses  and for me it is just pure greed when they're getting paid even larger amounts like this. Lobbying is seedy in many ways . When very rich companies or people can sway decisions behind the scenes it is just bent . I think it is sad that his wife committed suicide but that cant excuse what he did. He also seems to have no acceptance that what he was doing was wrong. The government trying to excuse it and change the rules was just a car crash and so unethical it was embarrassing. I think it was yet another big blunder that will cost them votes at the next election. I am just just sick of the dishonesty across all parties  . I don,t think they should have second jobs and if they do they only get one wage. PRINCE ANDREW LAWSUIT. I think the whole thing is really sleazy. The way he was trying to avoid being served papers was pathetic. The trial of Ghislaine Maxwell is ongoing and it all sounds really nasty to me. Pilot saying he flew in 14 year olds and  the prince as well as the other dubious cast list including Trump,Clinton,Spacey . I think it will end up being that it boils down to rich arrogant men using their wealth and influence to have young vulnerable women to use sexually and it disgusts me. Its high level pimping . I don,t know if he will ever end up in criminal court but his explanations have been ridiculous that he was out having pizza and doesn't remember meeting one of the young women,despite there being photos of them. His weird plea that he couldn't have done it as he doesn't sweat ??? REALLY. No doubt some very well paid dodgy lawyers will try to discredit the victims and witnesses and a lot of it happened pre internet days so not sure if theres any other physical evidence . His reputation is a car crash now and it has shamed the royal family in my opinion."

We will be asking you about COP26 as one of the next Directive themes, so please hold your thoughts and opinions on this for now. In the third part of the Directive, we have made a list of events you might wish to write about: . COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” . Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” . The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 . The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess .

Please take some time to comment on any of these subjects, or on any other items from the news, which you feel we should be covering at this time. We want to hear your opinions, along with details about conversations you have had, or stories and experiences and reactions to reports in the press. I intentionally avoid the news, so I know nothing about Sir David Amess or Owen Patterson. Boris Johnson is in trouble for hosting a Christmas Party at Downing Street though, I haven’t been able to avoid that. It’s interesting that people are making a fuss –it’s not like it is out of character, or worse than his manifest culpability in the deaths of many of those who died of COVID, so it’s odd that the media and those leaking news to them have chosen now to get rid of him. They’ll play their games without my input though, so I’m going to giveit any thought. I’m not sure where we are with COVID. I’ve had my third jab, but I think we still have to wear masks in public spaces. I am wearing mine regardless, but if there are other restrictions still in force, I don’t know about them. I’m not really out and about much anyway –I don’t really see the need to go into the office, I’m still doing things like my evening classes online (and I think the Council are keeping those mostly online anyway to save themselves opening buildings). So I’m not living directly under restrictions, but the two years of restrictions have reshaped the life I’m living. Having said that, I have been to the pub a few times, and went to a restaurant during Restaurant Week. And I suppose I have been back doing things like the dance sessions with the pensioners I met when Iwas in academia. I’m not back at pre-COVID levels though, and I don’t think I ever want to be –it’s quite nice to not be out two nights a week, or to have to navigate Eldon Square shopping centre, or whatever. Maybe everyone else is back to normal –it’s hard to tell. It feels like there are a lot of people out around town whenever I pass through, but I think any people would feel like a lot now. The electricity thing was something I noticed – we had people door-stepping to try and sell us a new power supplier, and my aunt had her company go bust on her. I think I renewed mine on a fixed price contract before everything went haywire, so I’m probably doing quite well relatively speaking. My bills are higher than they predicted, but I think that’s a standard thing – they always underestimate your usage, probably so their prices look lower when you do the price comparison. I read an article in the London Review of Books which explained why everything was so expensive, but I’ve now forgotten what the reasons were. I had not realised it was the centenary of the red poppy. I am a pacifist, so wear the white poppy, which is a bit younger (89 years, I think – the first was 1933 created by the Women’s Co-Operative Guild). I think the red poppy has been co-opted in favour of war and violence – it has been made to stand for ‘sacrifice’ rather than ‘loss’, shifting the story from something tragic to be mourned and avoided to something heroic and so desirable.You see the same in things like ‘Help for Heroes’– already that name gives the lie, because if they were valued as heroes they wouldn’t be reliant on charity, but it turns people who kill for a living and suffer the trauma of that into positive role models. I try to avoid Remembrance Sunday and the hype surrounding it, I find it depressing as it glorifies war and makes it more likely. I’m writing this late – in January 2022 – so by this point Prince Andrew has been stripped of his royal status (I think, I’m hazy on the details, I’m not sure what ‘being stripped of his royal status’ actually entails. He used to play golf with dictators, but that was because he was a ‘trade envoy’, so maybe he still gets to do that, but not while wearing his special hat?). What with himand Charles’ son, I do wonder if there will be any Royals left by the point the Queen dies. No great loss if there aren’t – Barbados got rid of the Queen quite recently and replaced her with Rhianna, so running out of Royals would create the space for Grace Jones to finally get the recognition she deserves. Andrew is being sued in the US for sexual assaults on an under-age girl, which have come to light as part of the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking allegations. (Alleged in Epstein’s case, as he was murdered before he was brought to trial, I think Maxwell has now been convicted.) I have no opinion on whether he did it or not –but I wouldn’t be surprised, the powerful often abuse that power because, consciously or not, they feel they are above the rules. I think it’s good that someone who feels they were abused will have their day in court, particularly given how few cases of sexual abuse and violence reach the courts. (Although, it’s worth noting this is a civil case –as in the UK, it’s near enough impossible in the US for you to get your day in criminal court for sexual violence. Vera Baird, the Victim’s Commissioner, recently said thatrape in the UK was essentially without consequence, because so few reported rapes led to a conviction.) One thing which did happen in the UK recently was that standing returned to the terraces of a top­flight football game for the first time since the Taylor Report. Chelsea reintroduced it, along the German model. I watch lower league football, where we’ve always been able to stand, but I think it’s a good thing that it’s come back higher up. In an ideal world, this will push ticket prices down, allowing more people to access the game, and will improve atmosphere in the grounds. The Taylor Report into the circumstances of the Hillsborough disaster was deliberately misread by clubs – taking out standing and replacing it with seating allowed them to charge more for tickets and gentrify their fanbase. Rather than take the Report’s recommendations that standing be made safe, they opted for seating. They’ll be reintroducing it now because they think they can make more money that way, but sometimes a good thing can happen for poor reasons."

Covid 19 and time March to August I was working on the bed apart from one day a week when I went into the office to collect and process the post.   In August I took an extended DSE (Desktop assessment) and was given permission to return full time.   I explained that MDW was also teaching from home, with video and there was no more space for another desk and chair that I was having to take meetings and calls in the bathroom, for security and privacy, since the students could hear me, and that my back was hurting.   The boss made it clear the other 3 officers and 5 assistants should continue to work from home, and that I had to jump through a lot of hoops to return.  At the start I was shopping once a fortnight in gloves and mask; this changed to once a week.  MDW did not go into a shop till about September. I did not always take the daily exercise since by the river, where we live was very busy.  Homelife I had never worked at home before lockdown. The VPN was a pain, and much slower working on one screen rather than the business need which is 2. There was no clear airlock between work and home. Normally the 25 minute walk back with music, is my chill out time.  I did take my full hour break, rather than working through as usual, since I was preparing a mid day meal for MDW.  As we live in a studio flat, it is quite cramped.  I bought a special, very heavy bag, to store my work stuff at home.  The summer was when we could not go out, our friends from Sweden had to cancel their visit, once I was back the weather turned.  Lots of rain.  Very cold.  Married Cambridge Admissions Officer Now I am back to work, I carry all my folders on my back and have to carry the laptop in my hand. There are 38 steep stairs to my office, the lift is out of order. The heating is turned off as apparently this does not meet covid requirements so very cold in the office.  I have been wearing 2 cardigans and a scarf - but still better than working at home. I am up and down the stairs all the time. The cafe nearby, Area, is open so I mask up to get my takeaway lunch - a hot chocolate with plant milk, and a grilled mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich on brown bread. MDW is my priority - he had first dibs on the workspace as teachers always do a lot of work at home even in normal times, prepping lessons and marking. His school is in the top 1% of the top 1%.   My office meets 3 x a week on Skype, no video to check in on workload and everyone.  However we chat throughout the day for work related matters on pop up Skype messages.  Appraisals, which I administered to TC and PA for the first time, and my own were done on Skype meetings.  The same is true for 121s.  We MUST have 4 a year though pre covid it was once a month.  As my line managees are part time I do theirs every 6 weeks.  Homelife  When I was working at home for 5 months I logged in at 9, and took full lunch break 1-2. Then finished work 5-5.30 and started tea. I did do less laundry, as we went out less and I could wear an outfit for more than 1 day, as I have a new outfit every day at work.  This is just as well as when I went to the bank for change for the laundrette, I was in the queue for 2 hours.  I was not impressed.  Even now the only bank open on a Saturday will not give out change.  26 years a customer and they refuse change which I know they have.When the shutdown first happened there were a lot of shortages - could not get flour, eggs, pasta or toilet rolls.  Even when supermarkets put restrictions on them.  TC brought me eggs and flour in exchange for an Ipad cover.  This must have been what it was like at the start of WW2 before rationing.  I spent ages going to shop to shop for items.  Married Cambridge Admissions Officer At least TC meant I could bake my own cake in May. We have not saved money as instead of being able to borrow library books every week I bought them from Ebay and Amazon. Also other things we could not get in the shops.  Mealtimes are mostly set by me but also to fit with lessons breaks for MDW. We only had a couple of arguments.  Luckily we get on well so much - many of our friends are divorced. I read and he games or we watch Netflix or Amazon Prime. Our favourite restaurant near work has closed forever. They did amazing steaks for him and salmon for me.  My brother in law, nephew and niece all lost their jobs.  The latter 2 are young and have got some work now.  Our best man, who has a high flying job, was unemployed for 10 months.  Media and technology Yes.  Skype meetings only for work.  Have not seen the majority of my colleagues since March and those that came in for IT since August were for 10 minutes.  So weird not to hug them.  PKA was fed up so I posted nail varnish set to her for her birthday. VPN log in when WAH. Online medical appointments do not work for things that need to be looked at e.g. cancer, injuries.Also I pay for flu jabs and cannot get one for love or money. Shopping online OK for Iceland but not for other shops - cannot get slots/prefer to shop in person/do not like their substitutions.  I always use a paper diary, I made more notes from calls, I use notepads to log the books I read, and I have a gratitude diary.  I am not a fan of working at home - I get that if you travel a lot to work, it is a big saving on time, and petrol.  But I walk.  I am also the first aider and deputy evacuation controller.  On the first day in August I was called to a collapsed female.  She only needed to go home, as it was faint.  But if I had not been in, work would have called 999 - as they would not take a chance.   Most of my call outs involve ambulances, or A and E/GP visits.  Cambridge  Admissions Officer It is rare only a plaster or Icepack is needed. Waiting  Yes - very much so.  Not seen mother in law since last Christmas - we would normally have seen her at least 2 or 3 times and taken her to the coast.  We afraid in case we take the virus to her. Saw my mother twice - short train journey away.  But not my 5 year old nephew whose party was just Mum and Dad. MDW has been to the pub a few times with a workmate - I am too afraid to join them.  We are waiting to see if we will go to tier 2, as the students have had parties/not distancing and are up to 180 cases per 100, 000.  Before term started it was 43. Waiting for a virus vaccine. Waiting, always waiting. Delays in getting drs and hospital appointment. NM is in hospital - do not think she would be if had been seen in time.  I need some painkillers but such a pain to get through and then get phone call back.  There were huge queues for Tesco at the start BUT they had a second queue for keyworkers, which I am and have the card, so got in sooner.  The bank - horrendous queues."

I wear a mask in situations where I don’t want others to feel uncomfortable and I have a strict hygiene regime, but otherwise there are no activities which I avoid. The remaining restrictions I find irksome, but I follow the guidelines. I will be receiving my booster jab next week and I do not worry about catching Covid. If I do catch it, so be it, but I am not prepared to restrict my lifestyle just in case I might become infectious. I feel that the world has got to learn to live with Covid. I have always thought there were too many energy providers in the UK, so I am not surprised that so many were running on such tight budgets that they have gone bust. I would prefer there to be just one or two energy providers, who charge more or less the same price for fuel. Constantly switching fuel providers to get cheaper deals has always seemed like a waste of time and energy to me. I welcome the centenary of the red poppy and am pleased that we still show support for the Armed Forces community. Long may this continue. The murder of MP Sir David Amess was shocking and highlights the need for MPs to take care and have protection when they hold their meetings with constituents. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and others such as Geoffrey Cox is questionable. I would suggest that any MPs who have time for lobbying for firms they have close associations with or who earn vast sums for work undertaken in addition to their parliamentary duties are not devoting enough time and attention to their constituencies. I am not sure whether I think that Prince Andrew is guilty or whether he is the unwitting victim of a litigious American woman who thinks she can extract a tidy sum of money from him. However, the interview with Emily Maitlis did him no favours and he seems to have been badly advised on how to handle the allegations."

Most of these already take anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety medication anyway, so it is perhaps no surprise that their moods have been affected. Some have had to increase their medication level or access online counselling sessions. My initial anxiety sent me into a flurry of excess activity. The house was cleaned from top to bottom and I completed many outstanding tasks. I also felt the need to communicate with friends and family more once the lockdown started, so I have made a point of keeping in contact with people regularly via video, email or social media. Overall, I think the government has coped pretty well considering the country was desperately ill-prepared for a pandemic. It is such a shame that we sold off most of our diagnostics companies to folk in Germany, Switzerland and the USA years ago. The UK has had to start from scratch to get diagnostic testing operational on the scale now required. In general, I think the daily updates from the government have been measured and informative. However, the fiasco over lack of Personal Protective Equipment has been lamentable. The other aspect of the whole situation which I deplore is that old people (the most vulnerable category) were sent from hospital back to care homes without tests having been carried to check they were not carrying the Coronavirus. It’s no wonder there have been so many deaths in care homes. I use my phone, the radio and TV to keep up to date with the news, although I limit the number of times I access the information each day to avoid feeling overloaded or unduly pessimistic. No, I haven’t come across anyone who does not have adequate tothenews. My husband’s profoundly deaf cousinhas nothadany difficultiesfollowing the news and understanding all the guidelines. I have done some work whilst in lockdown. I completed the final chapters of a local history book I am co-authoring and I have been helping various people around the world with compiling their family trees. Generally, I have enjoyed the time being at home with my husband during lockdown. We go for a walk each day and appreciate nature, as well as keeping fit and healthy. The only new technology I have started to use during lockdown is Zoom. It’s not my preferred way of keeping in contact with people, but I put up with it, even though I tend to get a headache after each Zoom session. I can only access it via my phone. For some reason it is not compatible with my desktop. I use Zoom for my regular weekly groups e.g. choir rehearsals and National Women’s Register meetings, but have drawn the line at doing my usual Pilates class via Zoom. For communicating with younger family members I tend to use Facetime occasionally and Whatsapp frequently. It’s the old-fashioned telephone for conversations with my elderly parents. I have continued to shop for food in supermarkets and have not experienced any problems. During the first week of lockdown it was difficult getting items like toilet rolls, pasta and bread, but since then I have generally been able to get whatever is on my list. There is adequate social distancing in the supermarkets. I tend to go first thing in the morning before queues have started to develop. My eating habits have not changed at all. My main entertainments at home have been reading, family history research and watching pre-recorded TV programmes. My favourite viewing is history and archaeology documentaries. The daily walk has been much appreciated in order to stay fit and get plenty of fresh air. My husband and I have also completed lots of DIY and garden projects. My personal hygiene regime has remained more or less the same. I have probably had more relaxing baths than usual, to soothe aching muscles after the daily walk. My husband calls anything under 5 miles a mere stroll, so we have probably been walking between 5 and 10 miles a day. I am a poor sleeper at the best of times, so it is difficult to tell whether my sleep is better or worse. At least during lockdown, if I have not had much sleep, I can retire to bed for an afternoon nap if I wish! (Please also see the Coronavirus diary I have submitted separately. See below on the next page.) MO number: B725 Female aged 59, married, living in Chester, retired FE lecturer, now Co-Director of archaeology company, family and local historian Coronavirus diary (17th March until 10th May 2020) Week beginning 17th March 2020 Having studied epidemiology at university as part of his medical biochemistry degree, my husband’s initial reaction on hearing ofthe virusinWuhan in January was that this would be a pandemic. Sadly, this has proved to be the case. Gradually, countries have had to impose stricter and stricter restrictions on movement of people and contact between people and this has brought out the best and the worst in people. Some are selflessly helping older and vulnerable people, while others are stealing donated food items from supermarkets and stockpiling toilet rolls. This week the supermarkets are totally out of items like bread, rice, pasta, kitchen roll, toilet rolls, tissues, canned foods, cleaning products, fresh meat and paracetamol. People have been bulk buying as though for a siege. Perhaps it will seem like a military siege during the coming weeks as more and more people have to self-isolate. Having spent time twice with a friend last week who is this week in bed with a high temperature rather concerns me. She assumes it is the Coronavirus but does not know for sure because at the moment only people who are admitted to hospital are being tested. This seems crazy to me. If my friend has indeed had the virus and this was confirmed by a test, she would know she would be in a position to help others once recovered. My parents, who are 87, are self-isolating at their home in Macclesfield, so family members are not visiting them at the moment. However, we are in contact by phone frequently and we are keeping plenty of petrol in the car in case we have to go over in an emergency. (It’s about 40 miles away.) Given that my parents don’t go out much anyway, self-isolating is not too much of a chore. They phoned the other day and their main concern was that they had run out of lettuce seeds! I was instructed to buy a packet of seeds and post it to them forthwith. There are more and more posts on Facebook each day. It’s taking up quite a lot of time scrolling through them. I tend to scroll quickly through anything that looks negative or panic-inducing and concentrate on the humorous or interesting posts. One photo that made me smile was of a Chester garden containing topiary ducks. Each of the ducks had been fitted with a safety mask! We are in an interim phase at the moment in the UK, with social distancing but not total lockdown. Whilst we can, my husband and I are taking a daily walk, to get some fresh air and remain fit and active. All the clubs and societies that we belong to have been temporarily halted, although there will be virtual internet choir practices and online Pilates classes arranged. Just getting used to an altered daily schedule, in preparation for when we are not allowed out at all except for emergencies. Fortunately, I am able to work at home with local and family history research. All the lectures I was due to give have been postponed until laterin the year, but this isn’t aproblem for me. I don’t rely on money from them because my husband and I receive private pension payments. I feel dreadfully sorry for all those on temporary contracts or zero hours contracts, who will be unable to pay their rents or mortgages in the coming months. It is hard not to feel a sense of dread and panic, particularly with the media whipping everyone up into a frenzy. A couple of days ago, one of my friends, who is a primary school teacher, was asked to take over running a class when another teacher was suddenly taken ill. My friend ended up having a panic attack and the Director of Studies had to take the class instead. My friend felt terribly guilty afterwards, but she is so worried at the moment because her middle daughter and new born granddaughter live in Lombardy in Northern Italy, where there is a total lockdown and she dreads them getting Coronavirus. Spotted the following poem on Facebook, which captures the mood in the UK this week: 24th March 2020 What a difference a week makes! My poorly friend is now in the cough/respiratory phase of Coronavirus, but thinks she is on the road to recovery. Another friend is now ill in bed with the virus. She has gone through the first few days of fever and now has the cough. She is hoping she will be alright and that her asthma doesn’t flare up. She is widowed and lives on her own but there are plenty of people keeping in contact with her. People’s reactions to the way the government has handled the crisis largely seems to depend on who they voted for in the general election. Those who dislike Boris and the Conservatives think he is making a shambles of the situation (a polite way of putting it), while those who like Boris think he is doing a great job and showing leadership and statesmanship. A polarised electorate once again. I have been impressed by the calm and measured statements made by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, irrespective of whether the UK is implementing the correct anti-virus measures. Life has changed drastically for my brother, who is Lead Director of Coronavirus for Public Health . To say he has been busy is an understatement. He is advising the government and is responsible for setting up hospital provision for people in who get the virus, in addition to all his usual Microbiology Consultant duties. He was ordered home at the weekend for two days of rest as he is not likely to get much sleep this week as the number of poorly patients increases. My older son is a dentist (specialist endodontist). As we are now in lockdown, the two dental practices where he works have temporarily shut. He is self-employed, so will have no salary coming in for the next few months. Fortunately, he always keeps six months’ salary in easily accessible savings accounts for emergencies. He will stay at home looking after his daughter aged 4 and son aged 2 while their school and nursery are shut and his wife works at home. She is a medical negligence solicitor. Our younger son and his wife are both pharmacists, so essential NHS workers. They will continue to work and their 4-year-old daughter is entitled to one of the nursery places for key emergency workers. My husband and I would love to be able to look after any or all of our grandchildren, but now the lockdown is in place we are not allowed to see them. There has been criticism of the government delays in imposing the lockdown, but I gather the delays have partly been due to the NHS desperately trying to source extra supplies, ventilators, staff etc. before the peak of the disease. The incredibly worrying thing is that the UK still only have half the number of ventilators and critical care beds that Italy has and Italy is struggling to cope. I remember a couple of weeks ago seeing TV footage of people being treated in hospital corridors in Italy. That’s what happens here on a normal day without a pandemic. Most hospitals have people waiting in corridors in A&E all the time and others waiting for hours outside hospitals in ambulances. The ambulance crews can’t deposit the patients, therefore can’t attend other emergencies and it is not uncommon for ambulances to wait for many hours, occasionally even up to 24 hours. Whether or not toencourage ‘herdimmunity’ is acontentious issue. Immunologists and virologists tell us that until a vaccine is developed, the disease will keep spreading until over half of the population have had it. The point of staying at home is to try to slow the spread of the disease until a vaccine is developed and this seems a sensible approach. However, there are some that think that we should encourage herd immunity by allowing/encouraging young and fit people to get the disease and recover before the virus has chance to mutate into an even more deadly form. This is risky because the young would inevitably end up spreading the disease to some vulnerable groups and cause deaths. Bizarrely, the UK seems to have sat on the fence and adopted both approaches in turn. Who knows whether this will prove in the end to have been helpful or a useless approach. The sad fact is that many lives will be lost regardless. The only consolation is that ‘experts’ from around the world are analysing data from all countries and comparing it with the approaches taken by individual governments. If nothing else, it might make the world more able to cope with the next pandemic whenever that happens in the future. 30th March 2020 Still healthy and well after a week of lockdown. My husband and I are making sure we go for a daily walk from our house while we are still allowed out to get fresh air. This is particularly necessary for my husband who is bursting with energy because he is no longer allowed to do his mile of swimming five times a week or his regular 20-mile walks with his friend. I’ve presented my husband with a very long list of DIY jobs to keep him busy, including painting and varnishing. I am limiting the amount of time I listen to/watch the news as it increases my stress levels. I can only cope with a certain amount of doom and gloom. The weekly classes I go to I amnowdoing online via Zoom(Choir, SlimmingWorld andNationalWomen’s Register), so they keep me entertained. The rest of the time I am busy with family history research or Chapel Archaeology research and/or writing. The builders closed the site behind Chester Cathedral where Chapel Archaeology are carrying out an archaeological watching brief, but not before my colleagues had worked up a good number of hours. We now have enough in the Chapel Archaeology bank account to keep going for about 3 years, even if we do no more paid work, so no worries there! On the subject of cash, the government schemes to help people through the lockdown are helpful, but so many people I know are excluded from the schemes and will have either nothing or just Universal Credit coming in. We stocked up with food on Monday. Have plenty of stuff in the freezer if we become ill and have to self-isolate. My parents, aged 87, continue to self-isolate in Macclesfield, but we are in regular contact by telephone. They have neighbours and the local church who will deliver groceries or medications. One of my friends with Coronavirus took a turn for the worse a few days ago and ended up at the local hospital. After stabilising her breathing, she was sent home to rest. It was deemed a safer option to return home. Plans are afoot to draft NHS dentists into hospitals to help tackle the influx of Coronavirus patients. This is worrying a lot of our son’s dentist friends who have young families. They may be required to go to the new field hospitals being set up e.g. in London, Manchester and Birmingham. On a lighter note, it is lovely that the air is so much fresher now there is less traffic on the roads. I am enjoying seeing a greater variety of birds come to my bird feeding station and love hearing woodpeckers when we walk through our local park. Spring is definitely here. 5th April 2020 Another week in lockdown, seven more days of long walks from our house. We have discovered streets and alleyways we never knew existed and I can tell I am developing new muscles in my legs. For the most part, people are being very compliant about keeping two metres away when we are out walking. The health secretary, during the daily Coronavirus update, was warning that he may even need to stop people going out for a daily spot of exercise. My husband, who is full of energy, would hate that. We have a large garden, but there’s a limit to how many times we could walk round the garden before getting fed up and wanting to spread our wings further. The supermarkets have imposed strict new rules. Only one person can shop at a time and then only for essential food items. No browsing or dilly dallying in any of the aisles. In the queue for the checkout, each person must stand on a cross, which is two metres away from other shoppers. Some shops have stopped accepting coins or cash, others prefer people to use contactless credit cards, rather than using the chip and pin machines. The most difficult part of self-isolation is not being able to see or look after our three grandchildren. Yes, we can Facetime them or speak to themon the phone, but it’s not the same as having a cuddle and a good snuggle up with a book. We usually look after our four-year-old granddaughter each Wednesday, but we are not allowed to at the moment and she is clearly missing our trips out and about. She asked us over the phone, “When is there next going to be a Wednesday?” I do wonder what young children are absorbing from the TV news. When I asked our granddaughter about her favourite nursery rhyme, she said it was Little Bo Peep. I casually asked her whether Little Bo Peep’s sheep found their way home and she exclaimed, “No, they all died in the field”. Perhaps our granddaughter keeps hearing the daily death total from Coronavirus on the news? Over 500 deaths a day in the UK, at the moment, sadly. Sobering to hear that almost a million Brits have claimed benefits (Universal Credit) in the last fortnight. Even more depressing that they are desperate for money and have to wait five weeks for the first payment. Yes, they can apply for a loan, but then that money will be deducted from their benefits in the future, making it even less likely that they will get back on their feet financially. My parents, at 87, are still in self-isolation and still well. They seem to be taking everything in their stride so far, despite the fact that two of their elderly friends have died of Coronavirus in their local hospital. They are not impressed that they can’t go to their funerals, but understand why. I gather there are now no church services allowed for funerals and the only people present are the vicar and a maximum of four relatives. Whilst most people are self-isolating, others, in the health service in particular, are working flat out. It is uplifting to open our front door at 8pm each Thursday evening and clap for the contributions our healthcare professionals are making. As well as clapping, people cheer and some even set off fireworks. People in other essential jobs are continuing to make sure vital services remain functional. We heard yesterday from my husband’s old school friend, who is electrician at the National Exhibition Centre outside Birmingham. The NEC is being transformed in to a huge, temporary Nightingale hospital to care for those with Coronavirus and he is busy laying the electricity cables. He had to order 64 miles of cable, which meant a cable factory had to re-open to fulfil the order! I think these temporary hospitals are an excellent idea. If patients with the virus can be transferred to separate hospitals, then a more normal service could be resumed in other hospitals. Currently, all non-emergency surgery and most chemotherapy has been cancelled, which must mean a lot of people must be suffering and/or be in a lot of pain. 12th April 2020 A third week in lockdown. A sobering and worrying week, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in intensive care in hospital with Coronavirus. A relief that he has now been discharged from hospital and will rest at Chequers for the foreseeable future. As the daily death toll rises, and has now exceeded 10,000, we are told that the UK has still not reached the peak of the disease curve. What concerns me is that the 10,000 deaths figure does not include those dying in the community or in nursing homes of Coronavirus. In Northern Ireland, records suggest that 50% of deaths are occurring outside a hospital setting, which means the true UK death toll may already have reached 20,000 people. Can’t believe I had topost apacket of four toilet rolls tomy 87-year-old parents this week! They live 40 miles away and were running short. Their neighbours had been unable to source any toilet rolls locally. Anyway, by the time my toilet rolls arrived in the post, the neighbours had managed to source a pack of 16, so I know my parents won’t run out anytime soon. On a more worrying note, their next-door neighbour is ill in bed with Coronavirus. She’s a hospital doctor, so presumably caught it at work. It’s concerning to think that I can’t visit my parents because of the lockdown and that the virus is alive and well and just a few metres away from them. Today is Easter Sunday and what a peculiar day it has been. No visits or celebrations with family or friends, although we were able to have Facetime video sessions with our three grandchildren. They were all high as kites, having consumed Easter eggs. At least they were in good spirits. The weather was fine and sunny so they were able to have Easter egg hunts in their gardens. There have been harrowing stories this week of families who have lost their jobs and have absolutely no money coming in. They have applied for Universal Credit but have not received any payments yet. One family with four children reported that they were being given donated food by their children’s school so they did not starve. There are the first rumblings in the press about the future economic impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. Some economists are pushing for the lockdown to be eased soon before there is a profound slump in the economy from which it will be difficult to recover. It’s tricky deciding when to allow restrictions to be eased because it is essentially a trade-off between increased deaths and prosperity for those who survive. I’m just glad I am not a politician. Let’s hope that my diary entry next week is a little more upbeat. It’s hard to see the positive side of anything at the moment. I shall endeavour to seek out and remember any uplifting stories I hear of this coming week. In the meantime, I will console myself this evening with some Easter chocolate and ‘keep calm and carry on’. 20th April 2020 Well, I am not sure I can be very upbeat when the UK death figures from Coronavirus in hospitals are over 16,000 and there have been at least 4000 deaths in care homes. Some officials are saying we may have passed the peak of the outbreak, so that is positive news, but there is no word on when the lockdown may be lifted. It has been extended for a further three weeks, much to the dismay of some parents, who are struggling with home schooling. It is worrying that up to 40% of children in some poorer locations have no accesstoalaptop or theinternet.There’s noway they can complete the lessons they have been set and so it looks inevitable that they will fall behind with their schooling. I heard one mother describe how she is struggling because she had five children at home and only one laptop. Her children are having difficulties keeping up with the timetables/lessons they have been set by their school. Our elder son is home schooling one of our granddaughters, which is going well and they are both enjoying it. But our two-year-old grandson is not so impressed and wants to go back to nursery school. He is fed up of all his toys, although he does enjoy the daily walk to feed the ducks in the local pond. Our son, on the other hand, is finding the walks tedious. Yesterday was visit 22 to the pond. The ducks are putting on weight. Hopefully there will be ducklings soon and they aren’t just suffering from obesity! There continue to be issues with not enough personal protective equipment in hospitals and care home settings. One of my friends, a keen sewer, has been making scrubs for the Nightingale hospitals. Unfortunately, she has run out of material and cannot source any more at the moment. She is feeling frustrated that she can’t continue to ‘do her bit’ to help the NHS. Boris Johnson is still recuperating from coronavirus at Chequers. He is reported to be reading all his old Tintin books, so I guess he is not up to returning to politics quite yet. He has commented that he fears a second outbreak of Coronavirus if the lockdown is stopped too soon. Nonetheless, I have noticed around Chester that some companies are starting to operate again. It’s mostly people who have their own businesses such as window cleaners, plumbers and electricians. I guess there is a lot of pent up demand for their services in the community and they don’t want their businesses to fold. 26th April 2020 Boris will be back at the helm as Prime Minister tomorrow after recovering from Coronavirus. Not sure that will mean an end to the lockdown quite yet though, as he is evidently anxious not to cause another a second deadly wave of the virus. In the meantime, accident and emergency departments at hospitals are only seeing about 40% of their usual number of patients. This is consistent with reports that deaths of non-Coronavirus illnesses, such as heart attacks and strokes, have soared. People are clearly either too frightened to attend hospital for fear of catching the virus or worry that they may overload the NHS. Doctors and indeed the government are now urging people to seek emergency health care if they suspect they are having a heart attack or a stroke. My husband and I have been busy volunteering this week. My husband periodically gets paid by the government to assess business grant applications. He was asked a couple of weeks ago if he would be willing to carry out assessments for the government's emergency funding for small businesses (on a voluntary basis). He agreed and this week he has completed thirty-two assessments. On the other hand, I have helped out two people with their family trees. Both ladies contacted me via the Ancestry website because they were stuck – one lady from America and one from Essex. My efforts may not have helped with the Coronavirus pandemic, but at least I have enabled a couple of people to move forward with their research whilst they are in lockdown. I belong to the National Women’s Register and one of the topics we are due to discuss is the consequences, intended or unintended, of the lockdown. Here are my thoughts: Positive outcomes: I have enjoyed the increased bird song and the peace and quiet from traffic. It has obviously been good for reducing pollution levels. The air has felt so much cleaner and fresher. My husband and I have felt less stressed without all the caring for relatives (87-year­old parents and three grandchildren 5 and under). We now realise quite how much of the average week is usually taken up with caring duties. I have completed plenty of family history research, both my own research and research for others. I have been able to enjoy reading more novels. I now realise how much I create stress for myself by taking on too much. Even in lockdown I have had a tendency to try to get more projects/tasks completed than there are hours in the day. Note to self: be more realistic. An increase in community spirit and kindness. Negative outcomes: The rise in deaths due to fewer people attending casualty at hospital because of fear of contracting Coronavirus or worry about putting strain on the health service. The increase in unemployment and financial hardship has perhaps been greater than anticipated. It has exposed how many small companies and families operate on a week to week basis without any savings or safety net. Increased famine, particularly in third world countries. More domestic abuse. Many vulnerable children not attending school, even though there are places for them. I am sure there are and will be more outcomes, some perhaps not evident at the moment. Some are saying that famine will be of Biblical proportion. Five countries named as being at risk, in particular, are Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela, South Sudan and Afghanistan. Even in the UK, food banks are reporting more and more people are struggling to feed their families. 3rd May 2020 Boris returned to work as Prime Minister on Monday 27th April and then at 9am on Wednesday 29th, his fiancée gave birth to a baby boy, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. What a busy year Boris is having! I like the fact that the baby’s third name is Nicholas in honour of the two doctors called Nick who looked after Boris in intensive care when he had Coronavirus. Boris has given his first interview about his experiences in hospital with the virus and has revealed that he was given many litres of oxygen to keep him alive. He remained conscious and was only too aware that contingency plans were afoot should he not survive. A statement announcing his death was even drafted. What a relief that he survived, not just to serve as Prime Minister, but also to welcome his new baby son. On our daily walks, my husband and I notice that more and more people are returning to work. We suspect that companies which were temporarily shut have now put in place measures to allow workers to keep two metres apart in the workplace. We also reckon some people are suffering from ‘cabin fever’ and that more social visiting is going on than might be expected in a country in lockdown. We continue to miss seeing our grandchildren and hope that we will be allowed to see them soon. My husband and I have been enjoying nature walks this week, actively looking for wildlife. We have seen herons, some donkeys, ducks, Canada geese, moorhens and a wide variety of small birds. It’s good to get some fresh air and to see that, despite the Coronavirus, animals, plants and trees are thriving. With so little traffic noise in our area at the moment, we enjoy hearing woodpeckers. Other European countries are coming out of lockdown and the UK waits in anticipation to see which restrictions are lifted and which will remain in place. Churches re-opened in Germany today. Services were held, but no singing was permitted. That makes me concerned that it could be a while before the choir I belong to resumes normal rehearsals. It’s not the same having a ‘virtual rehearsal’ each Wednesday evening via Zoom, although that is better than nothing. Whilst longing for an end to lockdown, I am concerned that there will be a second spike in Coronavirus deaths later in the year. This is no time for complacency. Until there is a vaccination or treatment for the virus, vigilance is required. 10th May 2020 After six weeks of lockdown, my 87-year-old parents in Macclesfield finally consented to us taking some shopping over for them. They live about 40 miles away and were worried we might be stopped by the police on our journey. The government have told people not to travel anywhere unless absolutely necessary and not to visit family members; my parents have been diligent in ‘staying home to protect the NHS’ and banning family visitors. What I find rather curious is that they haven’t had one of the letters fromtheNHSconfirmingthat they should ‘shield’ athome for12weeks because they are in a vulnerable category. Presumably they don’t have any of the qualifying underlying health issues. I thought cardiovascular problems would have counted, but evidently not. (My mother has had four heart attacks and has a stent and my dad has had one heart attack and has a pacemaker.) Various neighbours have been getting fresh food for my parents during lockdown, but it turns out they didn’t like to ask neighbours to buy non-essential/treat items. We had to take over"

We are just waiting for our appointments. We went to our local doctors luckily. Some people have had to travel miles to get theirs. It was really well organised. Thank god it was a dry day though as there was a queue outside even though you are given a time slot. It was quick to go in though. I think I mustâ€™ve only been outside for around 5 mins. They checked your temperature before you entered the building, made sure that you sanitised your hands and had on a mask. Within a couple of minutes the doctor came into the room and gave you the jab. Job done. I think there was around 2 or three doctors and they were basically taking it in turns going from one room to the next so it was quick. We had the Astra Zeneca (oxford). Everyone beforehand was saying that they were ill after having that one with flu like symptoms knocking them out for up to a fortnight. I just chucked some paracetamol down my throat every 4 hrs. For the first 24 hrs. and I was fine apart from a dead patch on my arm . Im still following guidelines and im still working from home. Im hoping to keep working from home as long as I can as I love it. I can do my work AND get the housework done all at the same time. None of that sitting in the office fretting cos youâ€™ve got a load on the line and itâ€™s raining or the opposite, itâ€™s a sunny day and you couldâ€™ve got your washing out. Itâ€™s great. I almost feel like semi-retirement. Im still tending not to go out much which is a good thing as itâ€™s saving me money. I just canâ€™t be bothered with the queues to get into places or just the extra time it takes to do stuff so I tend to stay at home and shop online instead. With something like this, i.e. a pandemic which is spreading so quickly I think that the vaccination should be mandatory if you want to continue a normal life. Yes you should be able to prove that youâ€™ve had both jabs if you want to travel abroad or in the future go to events. Maybe not have a passport as theyâ€™ve been on about but maybe a covid card with your registration number on it. Almost like your national insurance card. That way it can fit in your wallet, you can flash it, it has your number which is stored on a national database and so once scanned, youâ€™re good to go. Whatâ€™s wrong with that? The only thing annoying me at the moment is the fact that certain countries still wonâ€™t let you in. we were supposed to be going to Germany in September for a wedding of a lifelong friend. Despite by then us both having our both jabs (technically) they have closed the borders. However, if they opened it, they would want us to pay for a test before we go which is Â£250 and then another one when we are leaving to be organised there (How??) and then quarantine in a hotel here for 10 days paying separately for each person not per room as per the norm which would cost around Â£3,000 and then, have another test after that at another Â£250 each. Thatâ€™s disgusting. Talk about money making. Ive got a load of lateral flow tests that I ordered from the NHS the other week. I could take those and use those so why should I pay Â£250 to go and have one done at a test centre which would be the same thing? They need to sort something out with that. Surely if youâ€™ve had both vaccines and they are as good as they make out to be, then a lateral flow test when you fly should suffice, one as you go to leave the country you have gone to, an then another when you get back after 4 days maybe to be repeated after another 4 days (seeing that it can take 7 days to show up) should be enough. Someone like me who has pre prepared and got them already and enough to be able to do that, should be allowed to. They have the travellers track and trace scheme so they will know if we are back in the country and doing the tests so we should be penalised for doing the right thing surely"

Two words that conjure up different parts of the body. The health, the body as such and the wellbeing, well, your brain I guess. Healthy bodies have meant different things over the years. Years ago, we didn’t really think about it too much. It was more a case of if you were fat, you weren’t healthy but if you were slim, didn’t smoke etc then you were. In the 80s growing up and throughout generations even now I guess, if your parents can’t afford to feed you the so called healthy food then you won’t get it. When we were kids, yes we had veg but food was home cooked or whatever you’re mum had in the cupboard. It wasn’t always the healthiest food. My mum grew up on bread and jam and not a lot else. Her siblings suffered with their teeth because of it. However, my Nanhadnomoney,shesimplycouldn’taffordit.Rationingwasalsostillonforsomeyearssothefoodwasn’t available. Even now, if you were to do two trolleys. Fill one with frozen convenience meals and the other with all the ingredients to make the same meals. Which one will cost more? The second one that’s the one. Where’s the incentive to try and cook from scratch when it costs you double? A lot of houses either don’t have the time or just don’t have the money to fill their trolley with fresh food. It may be unhealthy but if it means that the kids eat then so be it. Ask most parents. All they want for their kids is for them to be fed and happy and healthy. But when you ask them what they mean by healthy, we mostly mean that we don’t want the kids to have any nasty diseases / cancer etc. we don’t mean that we want them to have a BMI of minus 6. Nowadays healthy bodies means a whole host of things.from people going to the gym to work out, not smoking, suddenly becoming vegan, juicing, taking 6000 vitamin pills a day. All ridiculous really. You can get hit by a bus later on in the day. Each to their own I say Ive tried all the stupid diets. I lost a couple of stone on slimming world. Put it all back on and more now though. Lost nothing on slim fast bar the will to live. Lost nothing on the eggs and grapefruit diet, nothing on slimming pills etc etc. A lot of it I guess is just down to cutting out the shit and moving your arse around more. P3373 I used to be a bit of a bean pole. A 5 ft. tall bean pole but I was an 8 to 10. I used to do a lot of dancing several times a week which kept me fit. Then the old bones started to grate, ligaments stretched. Then having a baby knackered the hips up even more and so now on doctors advice, Ive had to give up the high impact stuff I used to do. Can’t do yoga or Pilates etc as “you are stretching the ligaments that are already overstretched” (diagnosed with hypermobility – osteo arthritis and fibromyalgia) so now im 5 ft., in my words chunky (size large 14) and not happy with it. Im not over eating. only have 3 meals a day and don’t buy cakes or biccies etc. don’t smoke etc. so god knows. No im not running 10 miles a day. Would you consider me unhealthy??? Probably. However, I never fry food. Rarely have take out . Don’t smoke. Drink in moderation. Run around after the dogandkids,always cleaning thehouse andgenerallydon’tstop. So maybe imactuallyquite healthy. Idon’t know. How do you quantify health??? As for wellbeing. I always see that as being your mental state. All of a sudden we are being taught “mindfulness “ and living “ in the moment” twenty years ago if you were living in the moment and feeling the world around you then you were either considered a hippy or irresponsible. Now you are basically encouraged to do it I guess though a lot of it IS in the mind. Healthy mind healthy body eh?? If you’re going to be a morose moaning old hag, then your bodies going to reflect it. I guess you’re going to be depressed, sluggish etc. you’ll certainly depress everyone else so that’s not healthy. A lot of things are positive thought. Ive now got to the point in life where I just need to feel content with myself. Im 46 for god’s sake. Im menopausal. Got droopy tits, a cake shelf belly and chunky thunder thighs. Im no longer a 20 something size 8 with pert little 32 b boobies, cute little ass etc. who am I trying to kid? The only fellas im going to attract now is going to be the ones over 40-50-60. Im not going to attract 20 yr. olds so why should I pressure myself. I need to live the age I am. Not that I mean to act like a little old lady cos I don’t feel that I am one. I just need to have the acceptance that people change, your body changes, your personality changes. Im a completely different person to the one I was 25 yrs. ago. Why should I feel guilty for eating a slice of pizza or cake? Why should I die hungry?? It’s always constant pressure when you diet or whatever you want to call it. You feel awful and regretful when you eat “something you shouldn’t “and although you feel good and “what a good girl I am “because you can count your daily calories on one hand you are also left with the feeling of deprivation when you see the rest of the family in a restaurant enjoying their burger or steak followed by apple pie and all you’ve had is a glass of water and a bowl of salad leaves. Die happy and full. Don’t die hungry. Maybe healthy body does mean having a healthier mind-set. Maybe one assists the other. Accept that you are who you are, you aren’t going to be the person you were all those years ago. I’ll get off my soap box now"

I was putting off going to any shops. Even the once a week food shop was something to worry about. It took me twice as long and for some reason panicked me, and stressed me out. It wasn’t even just the covid thing I don’t think. It was change. I hate change. To have to go into a shop and sanitise myself on the way in, put on a face mask , barriers being put up, not going near anyone or panicking and shouting at people who came close to me. It was weird and has had a strange reaction.   However now, I getting used to it. It’s the new normal. I don’t mind going out. Ive always got the mask in my car so can put it on. Im used to now sterilising all the time, barriers  / screens in front of tills etc. it’s weird how quickly you do get used to things and adapt. It’s not bothering me. Im now used to having to queue to get a table to eat, hand my name over, order from the table etc. if anything it’s even quite reassuring to see that the tables, chairs and everything around you is being cleaned before you use it. It makes you ask how grotty things were before. The only bind is at the moment that most shops don’t let you try things on. I can’t be arsed to buy, take it home and then take it back when it doesn’t fit. I’d rather find out that it looks shit, or doesn’t go up past the thighs when im in the shop.   However, im saving loads. Im not going anywhere. It’s great. The bank account has never seen so much of my own cash in it rather than the banks cash. It’s actually in the black rather than being in the scarlet red.   Working from home, has been great. I want to eke this out as long as possible. Im so chilled. I can do my work, get the housework done at the same time, go and sit in the garden with the laptop when the suns out, it’s great. One happy little soul reporting for duty.   Most meetings are being done remotely over Microsoft teams. It’s still nice as you get to see each other on screen and still have the meeting. Ive enjoyed seeing the inside of other people’s houses. It’s different. I can see that it’s going to be one thing that stays in the future. It’s so much easier than traipsing across the city, having to find somewhere to park and then attend a meeting. It takes too long a time out of your day and is inconvenient. This way, you just log into the meeting in your office, have your chat and then log off. Job done. You don’t need to leave your seat. It’s great. No time wasting.  Ive just got to remember to either turn the camera off or mute myself when I either come out with an “oooo for *&^*% sake “or need to roll my eyes at something. Im known for that unfortunately. You can read me like a book.   Ive not gotten fed up of staying at home. Im loving it. I get up, put on the lap top, sort my work out, log off, it’s great. Im getting much more done. Just the sound of the clock ticking and the stroke of the keyboard that’s the only sound I need.   It’s nice to have a quiet house. At the moment, im waiting for our son to go back to school. He can look after himself, hes 13; I don’t need to run around after him. Hes usually upstairs on his Xbox chatting to his mates or out with his mates on their bikes. It’s been nice for him to be at home too. In fact, it’s a shame he can’t stay at home and do his school work at home. I know he would prefer it.   Hubby goes to work. Hes a self-employed builder working alone so it doesn’t bother him. Hes been working through most of it .his routine hasn’t really changed.    Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to"

We will be asking you about COP26 as one of the next Direc@ve themes, so please hold your thoughts and opinions on this for now.  In the third part of the Direc@ve, we have made a list of events you might wish to write about:  • COVID-19: boosters, restric@ons, returning to work and “normality” With Omicron variant coming I have tried to get a booster but I am not able to yet.  They don’t seem to know much about it and there are mixed messages coming out.  I will just plough on with mask wearing and trying to get a booster. Since both my children have had covid in the last few months I am more relaxed about it. They weren’t terribly sick.  School disrupEon is my main concern and the NHS being overwhelmed even further. They need more support. • Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” Yup our Neon electricity company went bust.  I know it could happen having worked in the .nancial services it was clearly an area that was being exploited but I needed to get good value electricity, I tried to go green but that company went bust too.  The whole market was not a real market so it was always going to fail.  Ofcom is .oored but it happens all the Eme. As long as the going is good no one does anything about risk.  Who would kill the golden goose?  Human nature is di.cult to manage! • The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 On and on we go. I fully support the armed services.  The endless harking back to WW1 and WW2 less so. The poppy is de.nitely hijacked by right wing naEonalists so I wear it for the week and then remove it. • The murder of Conserva@ve MP Sir David Amess This was very very sad.  He sounded like an amazing man.  A real leader.  I proper MP serving his consEtu­ents with honesty and integrity. Knife crime seems to be on the rise.  I don’t know what MPs can do about safety but I think it is very sad that they are not safe.  But are any of us? • The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn  Hilarious because it was so outrageous.  Owen Paterson was found to behave below the standard expected of him, but he and the conservaEve party have a lot of quesEons to answer about many of the behaviours and bank balances of friends and relaEves.  To try and rig the standards commi:ee and make it biparEsan was unforgivable.  I do not trust this government and unfortunately- because not all MPs are bad and self serving - they have made MPS appear to only care about their personal enrichment and advancement.  This PM is not a public servant.  The country feels very much like some of the corrupt countries in Africa where I have lived where the MPs are immune to punishment and the populaEon have to watch and suck up the corrupEon as the only alternaEve is violence which leads no where. I understand the sense of powerless­ness that those people I met in Nigeria and Kenya felt.  • The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York.  Autumn 2021 MARRIED MARLOW, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WIFE & MOTHER I am sorry for the Queen. The courts should decide his guilt.  It is all so seedy.  But I have had some seedy advances from older men in my Eme.  Are men really reformed?  I don’t know, I am too old to a:ract much a:enEon these days!!!  This whole case does raise the issue of young women, parEcularly vunerable wo­men. I wonder if you had asked them at the Eme of the abuse whether they saw it as abuse they would agree.

It is an unpopular attitude but I believe there should be some way of identifying those who refuse to participate so that restrictions could be placed on their movements and attendances to protect the majority of us. The rising cost of energy has been caused by the mis-guided policies of selling off utilities. As a result we are now held hostage by international concerns controlled by foreign governments/companies. The wearing of red poppies is the least we can do to show our appreciation to those who fought and died to ensure our ability to enjoy our lives and freedoms. The murder of MP Sir David Amess is a good example of our misguided policies of pandering to minorities and escalating their “rights” over the good of the individual. The conduct of the current government (that is all MPs) just emphasises how little they consider the needs of society and of the ordinary people. Basically it is a case of “do as I say not as I do” Prince Andrew knew what he was doing and now deserves to be punished."

Identify as QueerGlasgowRetired Social Care Manager/Writer & Life ModelAutumn 2021Part 3: UK EventsContemporary Events In The UKIt is strange to write about things in the UK as the 'UK' has never been more divided in political and cultural approaches to the challenges of 2021.I am so thankful I live in Scotland as the approach here from our Government has been so much more person centred focussed than the debacle that has taken place in Westminster.COVID 19. It came it saw it conquered. It is now life. Westminster made a total disgrace of everything to do with dealing with eh crisis. The idiot of a Prime Minister should be jailed for his scandalous behaviour. Or at very least sectioned. Here is Scotland we have had a much more realistic and sensible approach to things. Unfortunately, the devolved parliaments are not allowed to borrow money so we can't instigate a lockdown ourselves. Otherwise, I believe we would still be in lockdown and our borders closed.I hope the Public Inquiry into the crisis is scathing about the Westminster government. It will make no difference though, they will all still be sitting with their millions and their pensions. I'd eviscerate them all. The rising cost of energy has been a big worry for many people. The decline in use of fossil fuels has not gone hand in hand with enough development of alternatives. It is good we have price capping at some level, but if it means businesses going bust then that is unfortunate. But we need to remember we can't have a free-market economy where people can make massive profits, and that's what the companies who went bust were in the business of doing, and also over protect them. They took the chance and lost. Tough. Move on. I don't understand why we can't nationalise the energy sector and everyone's fuel bills be set at a standard rate. Also housing districts should be able to buy energy in bulk and pass on that saving to their tenants.The Red Poppy. It doesn't bother me in the way it does some people. I don't see it as a glorification of war. All it does is act as a casual reminder that we recognise the sacrifices of others on our behalf. It is about remembrance and even if only a milli-second you think of the forces personnel who have been sacrificed then that in its own way is its own immortality. I also see no problem with having white poppies for peace, or rainbow poppies, or pink or yellow or black or whatever.The murder of David Amess was shocking. However, he was a very right wing tory, so I feel no grief that he is no longer in the world. He was lauded as a 'man of the people', yet he voted against abortion, gay marriage and many other things that are people's basic rights. So basically it was only some 'people' he was a man of. He was basically a smiling fascist. I'm glad there is one less in the world and I am surprised more desperate people aren't driven to commit more random acts of violence. The government is corrupt, and sleaze ridden. The Tories are all obnoxious people, you can't be a tory and not be mentally deficient, it's like saying you can have a nice Nazi. I am never surprised by their appalling behaviour, and it's obvious they couldn't even spell the word 'shame'. I am more surprised that other people get surprised by their behaviour. It is clear they are there to represent only their own interests and regardless of what they say have zero understanding of what it is like to liv in general society. I'd jail them all simply for being a member of the Conservative party. I remember Iain Duncan Smith crying on TV when he was talking about meeting an 18-year-old woman living in poverty with her child, and it made him reflect on what his own daughter's life could be like. He cried on TV but did nothing, absolutely nothing, to help the 18-year-old woman. They are all scum. Prince Andrew is a sleaze and obviously has some very questionable morals. We need to remember though that all the royal family are basically mad and live in an alternative universe to us. They should be in a Zoo and not allowed to infect the general public. Prince Andrew is one of the worst. We all know these guys, the ones who swan around offices thinking they are the cock of the walk, making on-the-edge comments, leering at people, thinking making farting jokes is funny, thinking the world revolves around them. I hope Prince Andrew is exposed as the criminal he clearly is. I pity the poor girls who only choice in life was to have sex with him. The thought of him on top of me makes me feel sick, and I've slept with some rough and ready men. You'd be scrubbing the smell of him off you for weeks. If this was Victorian times, he'd be shown the gun in the library drawer and put us all out the misery of having to know he is taking up precious air and space. A few years in Broadmoor would do him good."

I was born and educated in England, where I lived until I was 30. My partner and I moved to New Zealand in 2003. We live near the capital city, Wellington.   I work as a self-employed Business Analyst. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * * Back in January my partner was going on about a virus in China, and how this could be serious and I thought he was being a bit melodramatic. In February New Zealand recorded it´s first case of Covid19. In March the case numbers here started to climb and politicians were talking about ´self­isolating´ and ´social distancing´. On 19 March borders were closed to everyone who was not a resident or citizen and by midnight on 25 March we were at Alert Level 4 (the highest level) of the Covid19 alert system and locked down at home in our 'bubbles'. And so started a very peculiar period that I suspect we will be talking about for the rest of our lives. New Zealand has managed to keep virus case numbers low (around 1,500 with 21 deaths at the time of writing this). We are past the (first?) peak and are in the process of moving down through our Alert Levels.  On 28 April the Alert Level was reduced to 3 and about two weeks after that we moved to Alert Level 2 which is where we are at as I write.  Most people can get back to work and school, although there are restrictions around the sizes of gatherings and behaviour in public spaces. Border controls remain in place, and the Government is scheduled to review restrictions on 25 May (after a couple of weeks at Level 2). My experience over the last 2 or so months has been a mixed bag. Emotions have been up and down. In the beginning I felt very anxious and was waking in the night and not being able to get back to sleep. I was worrying about my parents in the UK and when I might see them again. I was worrying about losing my job and what that would mean for our finances. My partner describes me having a ´meltdown´ as the seriousness of the situation became more apparent. I had strange dreams that I couldn´t exactly remember but that I woke from feeling really stressed. A few weeks into lockdown and on the surface the anxiety levels started reducing - I was adjusting, and we seemed to be getting a handle on the virus in New Zealand, and I had dramatically reduced my News intake so I wasn´t living and breathing Covid the whole time. However both my partner and I still had little outbursts: getting disproportionately annoyed or angry about a tiny thing, or just waking up in a really bad funk that soured the whole day.  There was this kind of adrenalin rush because this dramatic world event was evolving, but at the same time my everyday life was very humdrum and non-dramatic so I felt a disconnect between the level of worry and my experience. My partner was onto the Covid story very early, reading stuff posted on reddit from people around the world who were seeing the virus first hand. There were also disturbing videos on YouTube showing terrible scenes from China of people being dragged from their homes to be quarantined and hospitals overwhelmed and mass graves. At the same time I was reading The Times online (we have a subscription) and The Guardian, and they didn´t seem to have much reporting about Covid (maybe just one article a day). But I was doing a little bit of cover teaching at a language school in January (last year I got an ESOL qualification and have been trying to get a bit of teaching experience) and there was some concern there about students returning from China after the holidays, which made me feel that this event was closer to my life. As the news story and the case numbers started growing around the world it was quite frustrating trying to understand what was going on - the information was so incomplete. I was sucking up as much detail as I could and starting to feel like things were a bit out of control. The more I read, the worst I felt, and eventually I decided that I needed to pull back. I have continued listening to The Guardian Science podcasts about covid, for some hard facts about the science. I try to plan my lunch break so I can watch the New Zealand daily briefing, and I have started watching the 6pm News on TV (something we had fallen out of the habit of before Covid as we tended to get our news online). For New Zealand news I have been reading the Radio New Zealand website, and I still dip into The Times and The Guardian online when I want to know more about the world picture. The Prime Minister started doing daily briefings to the media just before lockdown, often with the Director General of Health (chief civil servant at our Ministry of Health), occasionally other Ministers and the Director of Public Health stand-in, and more recently the Director General has done the briefings alone. The briefing is normally at 1pm, and is broadcast live on one of the main free to air TV channels  The New Zealand briefing always has a sign language interpreter (or actually a few that swap in and out). I think sign language is the third official language of New Zealand, alongside English and Maori. Recordings of the briefings are available online, on the government covid website and on the TV channel website.  More recently the briefings have stopped happening at weekends, and instead the Ministry of Health releases a written update on virus cases and test numbers. All the New Zealand case and test numbers and a number of graphs and charts are also published on the Ministry of Health website. I believe that in general New Zealanders are happy with how our Government has handled the pandemic. Reading about what is going on around the world it feels like New Zealand has dodged a bullet. The lockdown has felt very extreme at times, given how few cases we have had in comparison with other countries, but I am grateful our Government has given us very clear direction: we had to stay home and our wages were subsidised rather than us having to weigh up the risks ourselves of whether going out to earn money was worth it. From the beginning the focus here was on saving lives by trying to eliminate the virus completely This was explained as a health  response that would also give the country the best chance economically, as the period where the economy was shut down would be shorter.  It is too early to know if this was the best approach, but I think it has been easy for the country to get behind the message of staying home to save lives, and putting people before profit. As we got towards the end of our initial Alert 4 lockdown there were people speaking up about we should be getting back to work quickly, but I think the progression down through the alert levels has been well handled and I have confidence that our Government is using the best information they have to make sensible decisions. Now in Alert level 2 there is more chatter about whether specific rules are good or bad and about how the Government isn´t doing enough to help particular sections of society or particular industries, but this is around the detail rather than the substance of the Governmetn response. Compared with the New Zealand Government I think the British Government response was too slow, and they haven´t prioritised the right things, and their communication has been muddled. I have been working from home throughout lockdown. I am self-employed and am part way through a 6 month contract which usually requires me to work at my employers premises. On Monday 23 March we were all sent home from the office after a Government announcement about the plans to move up the alert levels. I was told to take my laptop and anything else I needed to work from home, and to assume I would not be back in the office for a long time (ie don´t leave any perishables). The office building only opened back up on Monday 18 May, but will be run at 50% occupancy until further notice. Staff have been split into two groups and are allowed into the office alternate weeks. However, for most people it is optional to come into the office at all, so many of my colleagues have chosen to stay home for now.  Some people are staying home because they are still nervous about the health risk, others because it is more convenient for them. I am due to be in the office for the first time next week after 9 weeks at home, but at this stage will probably only go in one or two days. I am fairly confident that working in the office with hardly anyone there is pretty low risk, but I am concerned about catching a train to get there. I have not enjoyed working from home: I have felt isolated and unmotivated and have found the amount of time I am in front of a screen and on conference calls very tiring. I do not like the way the lines between work and home have been blurred during this period. I have tried to combat this by working in one room (our spare bedroom) and closing the door and trying not to go in that room at the weekends. But it is one of the darkest, coldest rooms in the house and being stuck in there all day might be worse than having work spill out to the rest of the house. I have had feelings of guilt because compared with people who have lost their jobs or whose financial situation is more precarious than mine, I am very lucky, but I am still annoyed by it all.  My workspace at home is pretty decent, I have a large desk and a good chair and can close the door on the rest of the household (my partner) if needed. I was having trouble with just a laptop screen (at work I have two large monitors) so we ordered a monitor online and that has made things easier and me a bit more productive. I have continued to be paid at the same rate for all hours worked, up to my pre­lockdown standard working week of 30 hours. Before lockdown I used to do my 30 hours over 4 days (roughly 7.5 hours per day), and have one day off each week.  Having a day off a week was a bit pointless in lockdown, so I changed to working my 30 hours over 5 days, ideally 6 hours a day, but this proved difficult some days because people booked meetings assuming I worked full time hours, so if I have done too many hours on previous days I try to finish work at lunchtime on a Friday.  As we head back to the office and have more freedom to get around I am trying to move back to my 4 days a week situation. I am currently working in a team of 6, within a larger department of around 50 people. My team has a regular daily 'stand-up' meeting that used to be at 9.30 in the office, but moved to 8.30 whilst we have been at home because no one has to commute and so we were finding we were ready to start work earlier.  We are moving it back to 9.30 now as our routines get more back to normal.  Some of the people in my team have enjoyed working from home because they have found it easier to concentrate, although there has been frustration about the number of meetings some days. We used to have a weekly coffee catch-up when we were in the office, which we have moved online.  We meet via online meeting software (Microsoft Teams) and all turn our cameras on (for most other meetings we keep them off and just have audio) and talk about things other than work.  Some team members like to relocate outside for this (weather dependent), or include their pets. We also tried a team lunch one time, where we sat at our computers with lunch and chatted while we ate. It sounds weird but it was actually nice. We are quite a new team, who only started working together in February, so this online socialising has helped us to get to know each other a bit better.  One of our team had twins last week and we all got to meet them online this week which was lovely and maybe something that wouldn´t have happened in quite that way pre-Covid. I was also on a call this week with someone who I know outside of work (his partner is a very close friend of mine), and his daughter heard me and came on the call to say hello, which was cute and seems to be okay behaviour in current times. Our department has a weekly general meeting where the leadership team makes announcements and gives updates on how things are going. Again this is done via Microsoft Teams which was a product we would use sometimes before lockdown for meetings with colleagues in other locations. We are all asked to mute our microphones and turn off our cameras and then just the person speaking turns on their camera and microphone. Any questions are via a chat session in the meeting software or privately afterwards. Some team members are not very good at following these rules and so we sometimes get to watch someone eating a biscuit, or yawning, or staring aimlessly out of the window obviously not realising everyone can see them. And then there are the random background noises, or the loud typing which can be a bit annoying. I think someone was loading their dishwasher during one meeting! Our department also tried hosting a weekly social  hour on a Friday, to replace end of the week drinks in the office, I have never been to this in lockdown, it just seems like it would be awkward. I am also invited from time to time to meetings with more senior staff for general updates and a bit of morale boosting - 'you´re all doing a great job in the circumstances' kinds of stuff.  Where the attendance is larger some senior managers are using Workplace (Facebook for businesses) to broadcast.  There are regular emails and online posts (on the work intranet) keeping us informed about what is happening around the business the same as before lockdown. My manager said she would be calling to check in on all her direct reports 1 on 1 each week, but I have only had 3 (or 4) calls in 7 weeks. I am not sure if that is because I am pretty low maintenance, or because I am contractor rather than a permanent employee. I think in general the company where I work has been trying to support us all at home, and as far as I know there have been no redundancies, although it will be interesting, as everything opens up and the longer term financial impacts become more apparent, to see if there will be job losses. My partner has his own business and was unable to open under alert levels 4 or 3, so he has only gone back to work this week. 7 weeks is a long time for a business to have no income. Luckily he is his own landlord so he could pause rent payments, and the Government wage subsidy enabled him to keep paying himself, his business partner and his one employee something over the lockdown period. He is now looking at what other Government relief he can access to provide some cashflow while he waits for things to get moving again. He thinks his business is still viable, but it is clear that a lot has changed around the world and it is hard to know how that impacts his ability to make money.  Luckily we are both savers and have a financial cushion that means we are not under any financial stress right now. Our bank has allowed us to reduce our mortgage payments for the next 6 months, and our expenses during lockdown were very low.  I have noticed however that our supermarket shop is more expensive than pre-lockdown. For the first 5 weeks of lockdown my partner was at home all the time whilst I was working, which was sometimes tricky but also less lonely.  He started getting up later and staying up later, and one morning stubbled from bed into my office and a (only audio luckily) meeting.  He was wearing only his pants and asking me what the time was - which was funny in retrospect but a bit embarrassing at the time. Over the first couple of weeks we developed a lockdown routine where we would sit together for lunch and watch the daily new briefing at 1pm. Then I would finish work around 3.30 and could go and do my daily walk, or an online exercise thing. He was doing all the food shopping and most of the cooking. We started having our dinner earlier than normal because we were home, and also started going to bed earlier (because there is a limit to what you have to talk about when neither of you has been anywhere). We have both put on weight during lockdown, from a mixture of eating more and moving less. To fill his time my partner took bike rides (going out for daily ´local´ exercise was permitted here), planned elaborate meals, baked bread and found projects to do around the house and garden. When the projects that it was possible to do without access to DIY supplies ran out and he was bored of cooking, he got grumpy and played online games. Since we moved to level 3 he has been going to his business premises most working days, doing sorting and organising and cleaning ready for opening again. He also stores parts from a car he is restoring at his work, so when he ran out of ´work´ things to do he has been cleaning and sorting those. I think he has enjoyed having time for projects, but has not liked having no income. We have both been keeping in touch with friends and family a lot more than normal, partly from worry and partly as something to do to fill the time. As we live in New Zealand and have lots of family and friends back in the UK we were already using Skype and FaceTime before Covid19 came along. Before Covid19 I would talk to my Mum roughly once a fortnight, via a paid for Skype service that allows me to call her landline from my computer or phone (she does have Skype on her tablet, but doesn´t keep the tablet on all the time or near her to hear the Skype calls coming through). Now I am talking to her 2-3 times a week and checking in with my sister to try and spread our calls out throughout the week, so Mum is talking to someone most days (she lives alone). My Dad calls me via Skype about once a fortnight which is similar to how often we talked before Covid19. He is locked down in England with his lady friend - they were not living together before this. My sister and I would usually talk once a week pre-Covid19, now it is 2-3 times per week with a lot more text messages in between. My partner would FaceTime his parents once a month, but that is more like weekly now.  He also has an Uncle who lives in New Zealand, and they FaceTime fairly regularly normally (once a week/fortnight) - the frequency of those calls has also increased. My brother and I would generally speak via Skype or WhatsApp calls once every few months - but I have spoken to him 4 or 5 times since the start of lockdown. In the beginning of lockdown I heard from a few old friends, and I also reached out to friends overseas. I have been using messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, a lot more since lockdown, to just check in with people with a quick note. Depending on the time difference I might end up having a bit of a chat if they respond straight away.  I have been very careful with the tone of my messages as I am very aware other people may be having a very different experience to me.  I have been having better and worse days, when I am feeling more or less positive about the future and when my energy levels are higher or lower, so I figure everyone else is similar but on their own scale. Most people seem happy for a message and are trying to make the best of lockdown, at least thats what they tell you in a quick chat. There is also quite a bit of joking and humour, about new activities tried and gone wrong, or home schooling/home working problems. A couple of my friends are in pretty tough situations, which is hard to hear about, but there isn´t anything to do except for listen. Early on in lockdown I called my Aunt in England.  I usually communicate with her by email rather than calling, but I was thinking of her and her husband being in the vulnerable category, and also that she doesn´t have any children of her own who would be checking up on her.  She was keen to stay connected with me and my siblings and suggested a group chat. Apparently her husband´s family were doing something like this so that relatives in different countries could feel connected.  After much backwards and forwards another Uncle set up a group that includes me and my sister and brother and their kids, and my cousins and the original Aunt and Uncle.  We have shared some photos of our lockdown walks and home baking, and compared experiences around the rules where we are living and our working or schooling situations. The level of communication on the group has dropped quite a bit since we first set it up. I am finding I have less energy for keeping in touch as the lockdown goes on, and there is so little news when we are all just stuck at home that there is nothing much to chat about. Also as we in New Zealand start to come out of lockdown and life here gets back to normal I feel awkward about being so much better off than others - which is not to say that anyone in the chat is having a particularly difficult time. My energy for most things has dropped off during lockdown.  The first few weekends I set myself tasks to sort through long forgotten cupboards and boxes. I sorted through old photos and letters, and I don´t think I was alone, I have been sent old photos by friends and family that they had uncovered obviously during similar sorting. I tried to get into some stay at home hobbies too: I tackled a few jigsaws and some embroidery; I wrote letters; hunted out my kindle although never actually read anything on it; in the garden I got down to my ready for Winter weeding and my partner tackled some major excavation in preparation for a vegetable patch we have been planning for a couple of years. I went back to trying to learn Indonesian, despite my major motivation for this -a plan to go and teach English there - is not really viable at the moment. Without a commute I was 'home' from work early, and with trying to stick to my 6 hour work days, and my partner not working at all, we started having dinner early (5pm) and then being ready for bed by about 9pm having watched enough TV and not having anything to talk about.  As lockdown stretched out my motivation for hobbies faded and my major past time now is watching TV: Netflix, Lightbox and TV OnDemand as well as a lot of The Chase (UK version shown at 5pm every day here).  I have watched a number of UK drama series that are available via our free to air channels here. I have also been listening to a lot of podcasts, including a few new ones that I have found during lockdown. My commitment to exercise at the beginning of lockdown was really good, but has reduced through lockdown to almost nothing now.  In the first few weeks I was getting out most days for a walk around the suburb (maintaining physical distance from others of course). From our house I either walked down the hill and up another road to do a loop, or crossed the highway at the bottom and walked along/beside the beach. I generally walked at lunchtime or after work in the week, and early morning at the weekend to avoid meeting too many people. One time my partner and I took a walk together, but mostly he preferred to go cycling.  The weather was pretty good for the first few weeks we were home, and I noticed an increase in birds around - presumably because there was less traffic noise.  My weekly dance exercise class was cancelled before the lockdown, but the teachers made daily classes available for free via instagram, and I tried those out 2 or 3 times. I also did yoga a couple of times along with YouTube videos by a lady called Adrienne, whose online classes I have done from time to time in the past. After 3 weeks or so that all started feeling too hard, and around that time our clocks changed and it started getting darker earlier in the evenings. As we moved further into Autumn we experienced a couple of storms that kept me in for a few days and next thing I knew I had not left the house for a week! Now, as the lockdown is lifting there is no real restriction on being out and about walking, but despite meaning to get up and go walking at the weekend I haven´t managed to recapture the initial lockdown enthusiasm for the outdoors. As soon as lockdown was announced I decided I was going to do an experiment to not wash my hair - isn´t the natural balance of oils supposed to return eventually so you don´t need to wash it? I lasted a couple of weeks, at which point my hair was really gross and greasy.  I was rinsing it in the shower, but no shampoo.  I was having to tie it back everyday and was really embarrassed to turn my video camera on for work calls. At this point my partner observed that it was hard to tell if I was wearing pyjamas or not because my clothing was so casual it looked like sleepwear.  I was also showering less, and some mornings would just fall out of bed and pull on something loose and elasticated about 10 minutes before my first meeting of the day.  I usually dress quite smartly for work, although it isn´t required and most of my colleagues just wear jeans. I generally have separate clothes for work and home, but this division had blurred and I was 'going to work' wearing things I might slouch around the house in, but never wear out in public. One day I just decided to wash my hair and I felt really great afterwards and I realised that not bothering to get dressed properly or wash my hair had not been good for me and I felt much more positive for making the effort.  Since then I have been showering daily and washing my hair every couple of days - my pre-Covid normal schedule. I have long hair at the moment, and I usually get it cut every 6 or 7 weeks, so I haven´t minded too much not being able to go to the hairdressers. I also stopped dying my hair a few years ago when the battle against the white hairs was becoming too time-consuming, so I haven´t been missing having it coloured. I am booked in to have a cut next weekend now that hairdressers have been allowed to reopen, I am a little bit nervous about it, but I also think I should try and get back to normal things. My hairdresser called to reschedule after my usually appointment didn´t go ahead due to lockdown. It was really nice to hear from her, although she is not exactly a friend, she has cut my hair for lots of years and it was just good to speak to someone different!"

Age: 65; Occupation: Retired teacher Part 3: UK Events . COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” I write this the day after 99 MPs voted against the government’s shift to Plan B following the emergence of the Omicron variant. Tighter regulations around Covid Passports being required for a numerous events and locations, and advocated by most scientists, were rejected by many MPs leaving the general population rather confused. This comes in the wake of the publication of numerous photographs suggesting that Government officials attended Christmas events / parties last year in contravention of the guidelines in place at the time and when Christmas plans for the general population had to be cancelled. Our own family holiday had to be cancelled just 24 hours before we were due to leave. Unsurprisingly, many people are upset that those setting the policies and standards for the rest to conform to were ignored by some. As a result, I have lost confidence some of the country’s leaders; many others seem to agree with me. At a time of serious threat (Covid) leaders need to set the right example and to mirror the standards expected of everyone else. Frustratingly, too many are not! If the Omicron variant impacts too much on the health services, as suggested by the modellers, and the government asks for even more strict rules, I suspect many will resist. A return to our pre-Covid lifestyles still seems some way off. Travelling abroad, mixing freely with people, partying, and using public transport without the need for wearing a mask all feel unlikely for the foreseeable future. Planning for the future seems fraught with difficulties. . Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” Sadly, this was inevitable with the pressure on gas prices. Many of the smaller companies offered a quality of service the large companies struggle to match and this will be missed by those who have had their provider switched. . The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 There were numerous events at which the support for the work of the armed forces were profoundly moving. Many people wore poppies with pride. One hopes that the wearing by millions of this important, poignant, and powerful symbol goes some way to demonstrate to both serving and former military personnel that their efforts, both in and out of conflict, are recognised by the public at large. In recent weeks, for example, the military have supported the vaccination programme, and those affected by flooding, providing essential support at difficult times. . The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess This took place near to where I grew up. It was a shocking and sad event that raised all kinds of issues around the security of MPs. For a brief time, the tragic events surrounding David Amess united the UK population in opposition to violence and a concern for the safety of people serving the public. The discussion and debate that followed the murder on Sir David Amess, and the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, however, quickly subsided and were overtaken by events of the days that followed. The behaviour of MPs was called into question as people argued that people in the public eye too often set poor standards in terms of the language used when debating in the Commons are when talking about others who do not share their own views. In so doing they are failing in a key dimension of successful leadership. Based on the extensive reporting in the media, Sir David Amess did set high standards in support of those he served as an MP, making his death even more difficult to process. It is important for leaders to set the highest of standards. Too often, the language and behaviour of leaders and people in the public eye leaves much to be desired. Too many fall short of the standards outlined in the Nolan principles of public life (selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership). . The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn On balance, and based on the reports in the media, it is right that he resigned. He fell short of the standards expected of people in public life and I was shocked at how the government flip-flopped on the issue. Another example of poor decision making from those in power. I feel sorry for Patterson’s children in the wake of their mum’s suicide and their dad’s fall from grace. I hope they are all being well supported given how the events played out in the media spotlight. . The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York. Even my ageing and frail mum (now 88), and a huge supporter and advocate of the royal family, feels that Prince Andrew has let the country down. I agree. Whether or not he ever faces the consequences for the allegations he faces, and that others might well have done without the enormous privileges he benefits from, only time will tell. I am looking forward to the film that will inevitably follow at some time in the future! Or maybe The Crown (popular series on Netflix) will include this story line in a future series?"

Autumn Directive 2021. L6048, Male, 72, single, Leicester, writer. Part 3 (of 3): UK Events • COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” I had my second COVID jab in February and my booster jab in late September. Following the end of the lockdown, in England, on 19th July, I started to go out more and also attended concerts of live music on a regular basis. Some of these events bore a semblance of the old normality -we did not have to wear face coverings, we could touch each other, we did not have to keep our distance. Now that Omicron poses another severe threat, it looks likely that we are all going to have to go back to masks and distancing. I retired some years ago so I no longer go out to work. Even before I retired, I spent many years working from home. That was something I was well used to. For me normality was being at home at lot during the day. That was never a problem -I had plenty to do. During the lockdown there were restrictions and I complied with most of them most of the time. • Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” My energy is limited to electricity. I recently switched provider. This was primarily because my then provider was attempting to charge higher amounts per month than I was prepared to pay. This happened before the hike in energy prices. I switched to an alternative provider. As a result, the amount being taken each month by direct debit has gone down remarkably. I also got a credit of £50.00 to my account with the new provider because a friend (who was also with them) had recommended me and I accepted the recommendation. Shortly after the switch began, my old provider went into liquidation. I felt I had got out just in time. When I left, my account was in credit so now I am waiting for money to be paid into my account from the credit with the old provider. (I received this payment a few weeks after the switch over was completed.) I wonder if too many companies came into existence and created too much competition. Each attracted too few customers to be viable. When I first joined my previous provider, I was very happy with their tariffs and with the amount they charged. As time went by, however, they kept demanding more and more money each month. This lead me into conflict with them. I accused them of borrowing money from their customers at nought percent interest by asking for more money each month than the energy were actually using. I told them I was not prepared to spend more than £100 per month and if they were not happy with that I would switch to an alternative provider. I told them that if my account went seriously into deficit that I would be able to make a payment online to bring it back into credit. My opinion of British energy providers is that they almost always put their profits ahead of their customer's interests. I supported the government bailing out some of the providers when they faced bankruptcy because not doing so would be worse for the economy. The government's imposition of a cap reduced the viability of some providers. It solved one problem but in doing so created another. • The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921. I have supported the British Legion poppy day appeal in the past. These days I do not go out much and have failed to find anywhere that had an outlet for the poppies. None of the shops and supermarkets I used had poppy day trays. I call myself a pacifist; but I am not a strict one. If our military has to fight to protect people then I am content to support that. I do not like war but I also do not like the impact of aggression even more. I am happy to honour those who gave their lives fighting for the freedom of others or died in the service of their country. It is not something that plays an important role in my life. • The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess. Even though I am not a Conservative voter, I found this very shocking. Amess was portrayed as a good man. His loss was particularly sad because he was a good man. As far as I could tell from the news reports I saw, his killer was someone with mental health problems. I doubt he was politically motivated or a real terrorist. Just some deranged guy who did not receive any help with his mental failings. This has happened many times before. I recall the murder of Lee Rigby. It reflects the fact that the government has not funded a strong health service capable of dealing with the increasing number of people who suffer from mental ill-health. • The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn. This episode has exposed the weakness at the heart of the Conservative government. It also shows that the Johnson regime is affected by public opinion, even though it has a large majority. Several other issues similar to this have emerged since the Paterson affair. Johnson is himself under attack on several fronts, including how his flat conversion was funded. As I wrote this, in December, many see Johnson as being under notice, some say 'one more strike and you're out.' There have been several times when the government has been forced to backtrack on its decisions. • The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York. I have no doubt that Andrew was guilty of what his accusers alleged he did. All families have their black sheep and so does the royal family. Just because a family is related to the monarch does not mean they are any different from the rest of us. What angers me is the way that Andrew has continually denied his abuse and struggled to wriggle out of its consequences. There is no justice for victims and any justice they do manage to wrest out of the various legal systems takes an inordinately long time to come about. The whole case was complicated. It involved people from different countries and courtrooms in both this country and north America. It was very brave of those women to seek justice in the courts knowing how difficult and costly it would be to fight their case. ends Please post your response to: Freepost: RTGU-AYJE-YSSC, The Mass Observation Archive, The Keep, Woollards Way, Brighton, BN1 9BP or by email to: moa@sussex.ac.uk.

Time has not been disrupted for me very much during the epidemic. Bear in mind that at my age and being retired, my way of life is an even plateau and one day is very much like any other day and has been since I retired. Because I am retired (and am not employed) I did not experience any changing pattern to my working day. Where 'work' is what I do, at home, as a creative artist. During the lockdown, I did not stop doing anything that I used to do before it started - other than going to the pub or to music concerts. In the first days of the lockdown, did your daily rhythms, routines, or habits change? If so, please say how and describe how this felt. Can you recall how these changes came about? Were they connected to specific government regulation or advice? During the lockdown my daily rhythms continued just as they had done before it. There was no need to change much. I stayed at home more than I did before the lockdown. Going into town to do shopping was curtailed for quite some time. Even so, I still went to the local shops to get supplies. Main grocery supplies were often ordered online from supermarkets, using those that offered free delivery for people who were selfisolating. My daily routine, during the lockdown, remained much the same as before.  It was my habit to go to a music concert at least once a week, if not more, before the lockdown. This was the main thing that changed as all the venues closed. I was still able to go for an exercise walk in the park every day. One or two of my friends stopped visiting me because they had underlying health conditions and were self-isolating. There were fewer visits of friends to my home and I rarely went out to visit anyone else. When the government allowed people to form support bubbles, I was able to visit my neighbour in the same apartment block. In what ways have different aspects of your life sped up or slowed down? For example, have you been furloughed from work or taken on caring responsibilities? Maybe you’ve been studying online or have taken up new hobbies. Please describe your experience of this.  I retired in 2014. I have never had responsibilities for caring for anyone. Both of my parents died a long time ago. No relatives of mine live in my home town. During the lockdown period I did an online course about COVID-19 with the organisation called FutureLearn. I did the course because I was writing about the pandemic and needed to understand the background to it in terms of its virology and epidemiology. The course was produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I did the course in April but I later did a follow-up course that was an update on the first one with the same provider. I also watched a number of films, documentaries and movies about mass viral infections. I also have an online account with the Open University and have completed a number of modules using that. These were mainly about literary subjects such as poetry or drama  Some would say that my main hobby is writing. I prefer to say that my work is writing rather than a hobby. It amounts to the same thing. In 2020, I have written several lengthy articles about coronavirus and COVID, some as background essays and others in the form of journals where I have narrated the course of the epidemic in this country and the pandemic around the world on a daily basis. To the narrative about what was happened in the world outside, I added detailed notes about what I did and this affected me personally. The only other thing that is a hobby I enjoy is compiling my family tree. I use online searches a lot to do this. I also collect old photographs from relatives. I sometimes have long telephone conversations with my few surviving relatives about our family history.  The only other hobby I had, during this period, was reading. I got through a large number of novels and nonfiction books and did more reading this year than I have ever done in the rest of my life. To date (September 2020) I have not had the virus and have experienced no symptoms related to it. The two tests I had for the virus both came back negative. Many people have spent more time than usual in their local environments. If this is the case for you, have you noticed anything in particular about the rhythms of the environment around you, such as the timing of seasons, plants, animals, the sun and the moon? 2020 has been variable in the city in which I live. Some months were particularly hot. I live in a flat that is at the top of an apartment block and it has a flat roof. Hence, it is always hot and stuffy when the sun is shining all day and remains hot at night as the concrete roof releases its latent heat. I refer to this as my 'overfloor heating.' Going for a walk in the park, during the hot weather, was a welcome relief. My house plants needed watering more frequently and the pots of seeds on my kitchen windowsill did well. The cat was very lethargic during the hot weather. She does not go out so she suffered from the heat as much as I did. Outside my flat there are many trees and I was able to observe them turning from leafless branches to their full summer luxuriance. As I often say, I live in the canopy, my flat being at the very top of the block. Having large picture windows in my lounge I observe the rhythms of the changing seasons on a daily basis. Are your rhythms and routines changing again now? If so, in what ways? Do you anticipate them changing again in the future? If so, please describe how you feel about this? My city is still under extended lockdown (in September 2020) but there have been some relaxations in restrictions. I am now able to go to the local pub. I started doing that again in August. Concerts have resumed at the local live music venues but those in the city centre have applied tough restrictions on how people can attend. Groups only are allowed to attend so that rules me out. We were told, recently, that the jazz sessions will start up against in October but with only recorded music rather than live bands. Wearing a facemask, I am now able to go shopping in the city centre. It is obligatory to wear a facemask on public transport.  The one thing I have not been able to do is to leave the city and visit friends on neighbouring towns. Had there not been an epidemic and a lockdown, this is something that I would have done this year, as I have done in previous years. I feel a bit cooped up having to be in the flat so much and being unable to do some of the things I did before the virus took hold. I have coped with this situation. I feel my life has not changed that much from the middle of March onwards. Those things that have changed, I thought, were not of immense significance. Homelife For those of you spending most of your time at home, how do you make distinctions between different times of the day? Do you describe these times – to yourself or members of your household - in any new ways since lockdown? For example, do you have particular times of the day you leave the house to take a walk or have meals? What factors influence the organisation of your time? My day, during the lockdown, has fallen into a pattern. In the morning I write. During the afternoon I read and go for walks. In the evening I watch the television and streaming films on Netflix. The day is broken up by mealtimes - morning tea, elevenses, lunch, dinner and supper. There are always things to do at home such as washing up, cleaning and laundry. I have to feed the cat several time each day. Each day has its own routines and patterns mainly separated by mealtimes. Owing to my underlying health conditions I sleep a lot during the day - something that happened less frequently in normal life before this year. For those of you living in households with others, how do you negotiate time in relation to one another? Do some people’s time matter more than others? Is this determined by work, caring responsibilities or maybe access to computers? I live alone so I do not have household members to worry about or am affected by.  I have a desktop computer and am on the Internet every day. I go on Facebook every day and am able to keep in touch with my friends (either real or virtual friends) using social media.  I watch the news on the BBC television and listen to it on the radio on a daily basis. I also visit the BBC website news pages every day. Being retired and living alone, my time is my own. I rarely have to negotiate time with other people. I am free to use my time in whatever way I wish. That carries with it the requirement to find things to do. To fill my time with what I like doing. It can be difficult at times when I lack inspiration to get on with something enjoyable. There are always times when there are things I should be doing. That does not mean they get done. In what ways have your lives come to be ‘in synch’ with or at odds with one another over the period of lockdown? During the period of the lockdown (from March through the present day in early September 2020) I have not had to make any adjustments in my life to meet the requirements of other people. I have very few surviving relatives and none of them live in my home town. The elderly relatives that I do have are spread out all over the country. We very occasionally keep in touch using the telephone. None of them use the Internet. Had there been no lockdown I would have met up with friends far more frequently. I used to go to music gigs to meet the people I know.  What changes do you anticipate in the time of your homelife in the future? I cannot foresee any changes to my home life in the near future and neither do I plan t make any. As and when the lockdown is lifted and we can return to whatever kind of new normal exists, I might well go out more. I look forwarding to being able to go to live music concerts once again. I look forward to being able to go to the pub with my mates. Visits to places of interest out of town will become possible. I hope. Hopefully the theatres will reopen eventually and I can go to see plays and productions. Media and technology Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to family or colleagues using online tools, having online medical appointments and/or shopping online? If so, has using these tools made a difference to how you manage, schedule or plan your time?  I am on the Internet on a daily basis, using my large desktop computer system. I have a smartphone but it is not connected to the Internet. If I want to speak to surviving relatives or family members I have two telephones for that and social media for my younger friends. I have been able to attend for medical appointments at my GP surgery in the city centre and this has generally not been a problem during the lockdown. Only once or twice has a doctor's appointment had to be changed because of COVID-19. I have done more online shopping this year than ever before. When the shops were closed, it was the only way I could get certain things I wanted and generally deliveries have been excellent. I order repeat prescriptions from my doctor's surgery using online ordering through their website; my medicines are available at the local chemist a few days after I place the order electronically. When I have had to communicate with colleagues (usually in the writing 'business') I have done this using text messaging or social media or emails. I do not have to schedule my time; it is my own and I can do with it as I please. As I said above, my day is ordered by a fairly invariable schedule of writing, reading and eating. I have never done video conferencing. None of the elderly relatives that I still have use computers. We communicate with each other using the landline telephone or my sending letters in the post. There is no one I want to communicate with (some distance away) for which video would be the only option. Hence, my never needing it or wishing it was available. Did other materials – for example, notepads, diaries, wall calendars – feature as well? What did you use them for?  Throughout this year I have kept a daily diary but this is something I always have done for many years. I also write articles for my personal journal - using the computer. I do not have wall calendars. I have no need of them. I keep notes on the computer about significant events that happen - things I might need to refer back to, such as when the plumber came to fix the immersion heater. Some things can be dated by looking at my bank statements. If specific things need to be done on a date in the future, I write them in my desk diary. I do not have a 'paperless office' but prefer the old-fashioned methods of writing things down with a pen or printing them out using my reprographics system. I enjoy writing so much that I plan to take up calligraphy as a hobby and now have a quill pen and bottle of ink. All my banking is done online. On the one occasion when I needed to visit my local branch of the bank, I had to wait in a queue for a very long time to get into the bank. Most one-off payments are made using BACS or cards. I have used less cash this year than in any previous year. I keep a small amount of cash in my wallet but I rarely use it. It is there for emergencies. I am now part of the cashless society, more or less. If you used new media, technologies or materials, or changed how you used them as a result of COVID-19, do you anticipate that you will keep using them in the same way in the future? The Spring Directive included a similar question. If you answered it, have your views changed? I have been using the Internet ever since it started in the UK. I use it every day. I am on it all day and all night. This is not likely to change any time soon. As a writer, I am continually having to do research or look things up on the Internet. The epidemic of COVID-19 has had little impact on this apart from needing to do more of it in order to research the articles I have written about the pandemic. Before the lockdown I was able to do research in libraries. This has stopped. I maintain a number of websites and have had to write content for these on a fairly regular basis. I could be said that I am a blogger. I also contribute to online forums. This is what I do and I have no plans to change. The COVID epidemic in this country has not affected my use of the Internet. Connectivity has never been a problem for me. Bandwidth has been normal since the start of the lockdown. There has never been any loss of supply on my broadband. Waiting For some people, it seems as if life has been put ‘on hold’ during the pandemic. Does this feel relevant to you? If so, please say how. Have you experienced a particular pause or a delay, for instance in waiting for appointments, activities, a new job or for work to resume?  Yes. For the rest of the world, life has been put on hold. It has not been relevant to me. Other than being disadvantaged by other people having their lives 'on hold.' There has been little I have wanted to do this year that I have been unable to do. I do not go on holiday so that is not something I have missed. I last went on holiday in 1999. My domestic circumstances prevent me from going away even for one overnight stay. I have to be here to feed the cat. Being made to wait for appointments has been extremely rare for me. I even cut my own hair. I last went to a barbers many years ago. Visits to the doctors (which I have to do on a regular basis) have not been greatly affected by the lockdown, as luck would have it. I have not been ill during this year. I have underlying health conditions but they have been under control. I have attended for a variety of clinical tests during this year and they have been little affected by the epidemic and its restrictions. Being 'on hold' has not been relevant to me. What is your experience of waiting? For example, you may have spent time queuing outside shops, waiting for deliveries, or waiting to see friends or family. Please describe how these times felt. I mentioned earlier about queuing to get into the bank. I spent much of the lockdown period waiting for deliveries at home. Sometimes deliveries arrived late and sometimes they came earlier than expected.  I have had more deliveries this year than the whole of my life put together. I have not had to wait to see members of my family. Friends, a little different. One or two of my friends are been self-isolating so I have not seen them as I would have done before the lockdown. Generally speaking, this year has felt more isolated than in the previous years. There have been times when I have felt like a hermit. Living a monastic existence. I have read about the life of hermits living in complete isolation in the middle ages and have known how they might have felt. They did not have the Internet. That makes a big difference. I have occasionally had to queue to get into a shop but not for long. It has not been a great inconvenience for me. I have done most of my shopping during the afternoon when queues have been less.  I have not seen the tiny number of family members I have at all this year. Had there been no lockdown I still would not have seen them. They have been isolating and the local restrictions have meant that I have not been able to travel to see them (or vice versa.) But then they live so far away I would have been able to see them anyway. For those who have been directly or indirectly affected by illness during the pandemic, how have you experienced time and waiting in particular in relation to incapacity, recovery, loss and grief? None of my elderly relatives have been ill and none have died. I do not know anyone who has died from  COVID-19. Only one friend of mine said he had contracted the virus and became ill. All my significant others have been free of the virus.  I think I must be very unusual in that respect.  ends Please post your response to: Freepost: RTGU-AYJE-YSSC, The Mass Observation Archive, The Keep, Woollards Way, Brighton, BN1 9BP."

The bins serve us really well although as we recycle as much as we can we also have an extra bin for cardboard and cans because our recycling bin usually fills up by tea time. I spent a great deal of time looking for something suitable which didn't include standing too many things in the kitchen.  These were well priced and are plenty big enough, with the addition of the extra grey bucket for cardboard. The three bin combination was from mail order and cost about £60 in 2020 whilst expensive it is perfect and I had read the comments before buying it too, to make sure it was big enough for our family.  We tend to empty the recycling and glass every night after supper and washing up, but we try and not empty the rubbish bin until it is full every other day or so usually. The larger bin at the bottom of the combination is for glass.  As our collected bins are separated into recycling, rubbish, glass and garden, I thought it would be easier to separate them in the same way indoors to help with ease of emptying and that was also ensure the boys, who empty the bins when asked for part of their pocket money allowance, put the right items in the right wheelie bin outside. To also help the boys know what to put in which bin in the kitchen I have discretely labelled those too: Rubbish, Recycling and Glass. I keep bread bags for many different uses, I also keep plastic tubs for leftover food from meals to be kept in for lunch the next day and kept in the fridge. We also keep jam jars and honey jars and some sauce jars so that I can use them for jam and chutney and pickling vegetables that we grow. We look for the arrows in a circle symbol to get an idea if the item is recyclable. We are aware that some of the items from the supermarket are not recyclable so we make sure those go in the rubbish.  I particularly like it when the bags are made from potato starch, these I put in our own vegetable and compost pot -in the image this is the small light blue pot hanging on the side above the grey cardboard bin. Recycling Collections Our recycling wheelie bin is collected every two weeks on a Wednesday.  The glass collection from a box is also collected on the same day.  Bins must be placed at the boundary of your property, not blocking the path by 7am on the morning of the day it is to be collected. Our recycling bin has a blue lid and green body.  The garden waste has a brown lid and green body and the rubbish bin has a green lid and a green body.  The glass box is grey.  All have the Southampton City Council logo on them and we have added our own street numbers to them also to identify them in the street. So it is called a kerbside collection as the collectors are not insured to work on our properties so to keep them safe the bins are not delivered back onto our drives but left at the side of the pavement.  They are not supposed to block the paths at any point on a collection day. Garden waste is stated as not kitchen waste but garden cuttings, weeds and small branches are collected along with the rubbish bin on the alternate Wednesday to the recycling bin and glass box. I have a composting system in our garden and compost peelings and egg shells as well as some paper and cardboard through a hot bin and then it is mixed after two months with our chicken manure and garden chippings in to an outside open compost heap with several compartments to turn each month and after 5 or 6 months this becomes potting compost and mulch for our garden. I have lived in Southampton for 20 years and the fortnightly collection is a relatively new enterprise which I think started about 5 years ago. There is no textile collection and so I bag these up and take them to one of the many metal collection boxes located around the city. If I have brick a brack or books and such like, I take them to a charity shop. If we have a pile of large items like timber or metal or similar from gardening or house maintenance then we make an appointment at the local recycling centre with our car registration and take it along to the bins there where it is segregated into dedicated materials, wood, metal, plastics etc. Recently we have had problems with the glass collection not taking place due to there not being enough staff to drive the lorries for collections and the City Council prioritising rubbish collections.  Our neighbour regularly takes any overflowing glass items to the bottle bank at Waitrose when she does her Saturday shopping early in the mornings. If I have a lot of glass, not often, but I would take them along to the bottle bank rather than leave them for the council to collect.  In this instance I would have to drive.  I would say I would visit a bottle bank maybe once a year or so and the household recycling centre about once or twice a year. With growing children, we visit the charity shop to take items probably 3-4 times a year.  Those clothes which would fit our neighbours son, are given to his mum, but for most other items they go to the textile bin or charity shop depending on their condition. As we have moved and downsized considerably two years ago, we have recently refurbished and have been clearing out as much as possible.  So visiting the charity shop and such like is rather a common trip at the moment. I am motivated to recycle for environmental reasons and to reduce waste.  I was influenced years ago when I bought my first house in Dorset and the council there were very proactive and one of the first in the country to start recycling schemes. I am now motivated to reduce waste and be sustainable.  I have been disappointed in the past when camping and finding that a campsite does not actively encourage recycling giving only a large skip for you to put rubbish.  It makes me feel rather uncomfortable to be honest. Once our recycling is collected I think it is sorted into different types of materials and I think with the case of some it is cleaned. Shopping choices I love to see products which state -I am made of recycled materials, and what exactly they are made of. I would definitely go out of my way to purchase recycled materials and those which could be recycled further after use. I do not think my recycling has changed since COVID, in fact I would say if anything it has made me do more sorting and clearing out because I have had time to.  I have listed items that others would purchase second hand, like furniture and bicycles and have made a little bit of money in this way.  I have also bought second hand bookcases etc, to furnish our home too because I have had a little more time to list and search for things. We have been budgeting through the pandemic due to having building work at the same time and watching our costs which escalated.  So this too has led to the listing of items for money that we no longer use and buying what we would rather have second hand too."

There is a sense of weariness about life, and I know from conversations with others that many feel the same as me. Over the past couple of years everything has been subject to disruption and the levels of uncertainty come and go in unremitting waves.  Now there is a new COVID variance which may or may not be resistant to existing vaccines.  Inevitably there will be question marks over Christmas and seasonal get-togethers as a result.  I have arranged a family Christmas, but it may not happen if it is decided that new restrictions need to be established.  I am so tired of all this. I’m not frightened but I am tired. No doubt I, like many others, will shrug my shoulders and just get on with it.  What else can we do? I certainly won’t be taking to the streets to shout and yell.  What’s the point of that?  Nobody listens anyway. I’ve had all of the jabs and I’ve also had my flu vaccine so I will trust that I’ll be ok, even if I get COVID. There is no such thing as normality now. What we regarded as “normal” has gone for ever. There is a new normal now and we’d best get on with it.  There are some things which are good and other practices which are tiresome but that is the way of things. In establishing the budget for next year we have allowed for significant price increases across the board. That will have impact, of course, upon our levels of disposable income. We were hoping to be able to travel to Australia to visit my son and his family.  We haven’t seen them for over three years, and I know that it is getting to him as much as it is to us. Whether the changes outlined in the above mean an extension of this period is difficult to know.  The current situation is so fluid that it may well be that we cannot travel for some time yet. Our biggest concern is that we will get over there and then find that we cannot get back.  There is still a need for caution at the moment, so we’ve decided not to book anything until after winter has passed. Our current energy providers are established national companies (British Gas etc) so I assume that there will be few problems there in terms of provision, but I do expect significant price rises to follow.  I am reducing the levels of use in terms of heating and lighting because I do feel that we waste a lot of energy (lights on in rooms which we aren’t using and so on) and I am engaged in a constant campaign with my husband over this. He seems to be more cavalier in approach and I seem to spend a lot of time in going into rooms, switching off lights that he’s left on. It really irritates me. I always purchase a poppy badge every November.  My dear father was in the Royal Artillery during the war, and I know that he had a pretty dreadful time in the Far East. Since then others have made similar sacrifices.  It is not a comment on the politics of the situation.  It is an appreciation of the commitment that such men and women have made, and it is not something to be taken for granted.  I’m happy to think that my few quid can assist in making those lives a little easier. I lived in Basildon when I was first married.  David Amess became the town’s MP in 1983. He was prominent in the town and seemed to be an affable soul.  I didn’t always see eye to eye with his politics, but I could see that he had the courage of his convictions and I respected that. Later, once we had moved up north, he became MP where my daughter lived in Leigh on Sea. They were also poles apart politically but my son in law taught at the local comprehensive and Sir David visited frequently. DG showed him around the school, and they discussed educational matters which affected the school.  DG did not share his political views, but he did accept that he was sincere in his beliefs and wanted to do the best for his constituency and for the people who lived in it.  They simply had different ideas as to how that might be achieved. DG also played in a local band and Sir David always turned up to the Leigh on Sea Folk Festival, held every year before COVID caboshed the whole thing.  From that point of view he will be missed, a fine constituency MP, who genuinely cared. For that reason alone DG and my daughter will miss him. The terrible violence of such an attack upon such a man is abhorrent in the extreme and my thoughts are with his wife and family who have to carry on knowing of the horror which befell him. I don’t mind governments doing U-turns if it is done for the right reasons, (i.e. we’ve made a mistake, we were wrong to think that and so we don’t do it). I wish that I could believe that this is the situation re the Owen Paterson incident.  I fear not. They have been rumbled and had to take steps which wouldn’t have happened had they managed the situation properly in the first place. The whole situation re politics at the moment is causing me great disquiet.  There is a lack of dignity, honour and truth here.  Maybe that has always been the case, but I never used to think so. We seem to be out of control, scrambling from one buffoonery to another. The other fact is that the mistakes which are made are so basic that you wonder how on earth we can carry on in this Keystone Cops fashion.  A bunch of clowns steering a car which is about to fall to bits in the middle of the circus. I am not a member of a political party.  In terms of beliefs I tend to steer a middle course, a little to the left of centre but not excessively so. If you really need to affix a label to me I guess that I’m a left of centre Conservative (yes, there is such a thing and there’s quite a few of us). I believe in compassion for the weak and help for people to establish better lives for themselves, as it will be paid back ten-fold if we do that. But the entitlement brigade can bugger off.  Some people in this area, who’ve never done anything worthwhile, are selfish and ignorant, and feel that they are somehow entitled to this that and the other just because they are of a certain age.  No. You’re not. HRH Duke of York has never been a favourite of mine. He comes over as being selfish and feckless.  Now I am aware that this image is rather engendered by the media and so I do approach this with a degree of caution.  But it is clear that something has been going on and he should be doing his utmost to assist the authorities to get to the truth.  The interview in which he participated was a total embarrassment.  If there is nothing to be ashamed of he should simply co-operate and let the legal authorities in the USA know that he is willing to help.  This apparent reluctance to help does rather raise suspicion that he has been involved in a murky situation. How dare he be so arrogant to consider that it is unnecessary for him to help where it is clear that he may be able to. Poor Queen simply doesn’t need this on top of everything else. He needs his arse kicking."

I took early retirement at the age of 50 and haven’t regretted it for a moment. I completed a part-time degree course in Landscape Studies at Sussex University in 2006, obtaining my BA. I live at Southwick in West Sussex, and I am married with two grown up daughters, and three grandchildren, the youngest of whom is 19. I had a heart attack in November 2012, and was fitted with a pacemaker/defibrillator in August 2013 which was replaced in May 2021. AUTUMN 2021 (No.123) Part 3: UK Events As I have got older, I have taken less and less notice of the news as most events have little or no relevance to my daily life. So my knowledge of your items is scanty at best but I will endeavour to make some comment. COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work, and ‘normality’ This is one item that has affected me and my lifestyle. I have had both my injections and, after a bit of pushing, my booster jab. Holidays seem to be a thing of the past, and mask wearing in public places is now the norm so life has changed. Eating out is also a rarity; I think I have only been out 2 or 3 times since the pandemic began, whereas it used to be a regular monthly event. Being retired, working from home does not affect me, but both my daughters do this, and continue to do so, only going to their offices on an occasional basis. This seems to be the new normality, and the COVID virus will always be with us. We should now try and get on with our lives and treat this virus as we do all others, such as flu. A Global panic mode seems to have set in, which shows no sign of ceasing any time soon, and our own Government gives so many mixed messages that no one is quite sure how they should act. Rising energy bills and energy companies going ‘bust’ I am not unduly concerned at the potential rises in costs for electricity and gas, as these have always risen, although gas has fallen back over

December, and whilst the gas has increased by 13p per unit over last year to 54p per unit, it is equivalent to what I was paying in 2013 and less than the two subsequent years. The electricity has increased to 24p per unit, an increase in line with the general trend. I cannot therefore see why there is now so much fuss over these prices. I have stuck with the original suppliers on the standard tariffs, and whilst I may have saved some money if I had shopped around and moved to these smaller energy companies offering cheaper rates, I might now be scratching around for a new supplier to replace the ones who have gone bust. The Centenary of the red poppy I think it is important to remember the sacrifices made by so many, who gave their lives to ensure our freedom from tyranny. As these great world conflicts (and lesser wars since) fade into history, we must not forget. The red poppy symbol brings this to the forefront of our minds each year. The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess Whilst all murders are tragic, this was not the first murder of an MP, and in today’s violent society probably won’t be the last. I was aware that it happened, but did not follow the event closely and cannot make any further comment. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn Nothing MP’s do surprises me, and I took no interest in this case at all. MP’s should be beyond reproach, as they are our representatives in the Governance of the country, but some, when ensconced in the Westminster ‘bubble’ look on it as a gravy train to line their pockets as much as possible. The lawsuit involving Prince Andrew, The Duke of York I have paid little heed to this case, having no interest in it whatsoever and therefore cannot make any informed comment. What I would say is that Prince Andrew is a man, subject to all the foibles of his gender, but, as the Queen’s son, and in a privileged position, he should use more discretion in his private life."

Mass-Observer M7145 describes themself as female; age 65; widow; retired administrator.;The Directive 'UK Events' was issued on 1 November 2021 and asked Mass-Observers for their opinions on recent events that had taken place in the UK, including 'COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and 'normality''; 'rising energy bills and energy companies going 'bust''; 'the centenary of the red poppy'; 'the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess'; 'the conduct of MP Owen Paterson and government U-turn'; 'the lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, Duke of York'.","MO 7145, Female, 65, widow, Plymouth, retired administrator AUTUMN DIRECTIVE 2021   PART 3: EVENTS Rising energy bills and energy companies going ‘bust’ Although the energy situation is the culmination of a number of events, not least the invasion of Ukraine (I realise the latter was not an issue at the time the directive was set) I believe the issue of companies selling energy at unrealistic prices, was avoidable.  There is always the capacity for poorly-run businesses to fail, but I think in this case that Ofgem has a big responsibility here. What on earth was their regulatory approach towards these rock bottom price companies and protecting the interests of consumers. Their role is supposedly to regulate the industry and they failed to strengthen the rules that could have avoided collapse of so many companies. Such cheap energy was never going to be sustainable, from an economic and environmental point of view.  Green energy requires investment and companies going down the route of encouraging people to switch to the cheapest tariffs, driving down standards, just to get the customers, was just asking for trouble further down the road.  It was akin to sticking their collective company heads in the sand.  My fixed term contract ends in June 2022 and I am facing a rise from £96 to £139 a month. I’ve been buying green tariffs for many years and switched three years ago from a green tariff with a supplier, to Good Energy, a company that buys 100% of its energy directly from independent green energy generators. Although I could have found a cheaper tariff at the time I last switched, supporting green energy companies was the way I wanted to go.  I have decided to accept the new variable contract, despite a likely hike again in the Autumn.  The alternative was a one year fixed contract at nearly twice the variable one. I am fortunate in that I qualify for my State Pension this summer, so will have additional income which will more than cover the rise in my energy costs. My friend W is younger so doesn’t have that buffer, and has already incurred a similar rise, but she says she would rather know exactly what she will be paying for the next year.  So she has taken a fixed contract which is hitting her quite hard.  It remains to be seen whether I will lose out in the Autumn.  I am hoping not, even if it goes up another 50%, it should still be lower than the fixed rate I have been offered. The energy crisis is really worrying for many people on fixed incomes and limited resources.  Some friends recently criticised members of the public being interviewed on local news programmes, saying their mantra of ‘eat or heat’ is down to ignorance of how to manage money, of home cooking and of wearing the right clothes.  I think this is harsh and over-simplification, as many of us older residents don’t have the burden of a mortgage or rent.  The latter especially has seen such big rises recently, people on low or even average, incomes, are finding they have less and less to spend on services and food.  I do feel that budgeting and cooking doesn’t come easily to many people and seems to have been missing from the national curriculum for years, so it’s not surprising that young people aren’t learning the skills. My nephew and wife are in their 30s and 40s and in early 2022 managed to secure a mortgage for the flat they have rented for three years.  What a relief that has been to them, no longer having to face rent rises, being able to improve their living conditions, their running costs and insulation, knowing they are investing in their own property.  They saw a big rise in their energy bills in 2021 when their supplier went bust, so now at least their housing costs are more under their own control. The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 Coming from a military family, this is a subject close to my heart.  The red poppy is an iconic symbol and the Poppy Appeal is essential in raising funds for the important work the RBL does to support serving personnel and veterans and their families. I have volunteered with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission since 2017, when the Poppies Wave sculpture tour came to Plymouth.  This was presented by the CWGC and 14-18 NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the First World War centenary.  It was part of the UK tour of the poppy sculptures, Wave and Weeping Window and the tour began at The Tower of London in 2014. The installation there was called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red (artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper) and the dramatic title beautifully evokes the impact of the flowing blood-red sculpture against the stone walls. There was great publicity at the time and the image of the poppies seemed to really resonate with people around the world. 888,246 poppies were sold off for charity from the London installation and a project in later years aimed to track the poppies down, digitally map them across the globe and record the stories of why they were bought and where they are now. The Plymouth sculpture took the form of an installation of individual bright red ceramic poppy heads on stalks, arranged in a sweeping arch that flowed down over the CWGC Naval Memorial on Plymouth Hoe.  It was a very moving sculpture and I spent August to November in all weathers (Plymouth Hoe is an open, south facing, level public space high above the waterfront overlooking Plymouth Sound), helping visitors to enjoy the installation, talking to them and listening to their own stories.  Being a Naval town, Plymouth has many serving Armed Forces personnel, veterans and their families, so the sculpture took on a particular resonance to them.  The Poppies tour went to other cities around the UK, being installed in places such as public gardens, cathedrals or museums, but this was the only sculpture on the tour that was actually installed on a war memorial which made it quite significant. A picture containing sky, outdoor, building, redDescription automatically generatedMany school visits were made to the sculpture, which was intended partly to bring the legacy of the First World War to life for the younger generation.  The poppy campaign year on year continues to commemorate loss in that War, and of those that came after, but also hope for the future. One odd phenomenon was that owing to the Plymouth Register Office being located at the rear of Plymouth Hoe, a few newly-wed couples came to have photographs taken by the sculpture.  Most were brief visits, some wanting to place a bouquet near a family member’s name on the Naval Memorial, or just take one photograph, but one couple stayed much longer, using part of the display as a backdrop, first for the happy couple, then the bridesmaids, then the family etc – as if this was a backdrop just for them.  They were obstructing other visitors from viewing that side of the sculpture, so it took some diplomatic work by the CWGC staff to persuade them to move away. The poppies were, to the vast majority of visitors, a symbol of sacrifice and memory and those of us on duty that day, and some members of the public too, felt the bridal family was quite disrespectful in the way they were using the sculpture.  I had decided to volunteer for the project earlier in 2017 as a way of keeping myself busy following the death of my husband in the April. I had some counselling that Spring and when I spoke of signing up to do the work, my counsellor observed it was interesting that I had chosen a volunteer role connected to loss and commemoration. I was glad that the volunteering opportunity arose at that time and I think the sculpture resonated with me because of family connection to the Services, to my interest in art and heritage and knowing the impact of the original installation in London.  Talking to visitors about their own family history, their losses sometime, often felt sad, but also helped me put my own situation into perspective.  I wore a CWGC ‘uniform’ for the role, and as I travelled on the ferry across the water to the Hoe, occasionally people would talk to me about the poppies, what the flower meant to them, and how important they felt it was as a symbol for them and the nation."

In fact many of them tie up with one another - and your request to leave out COP26 for now does away with the really big picture.Covid-19 rumbles on apace and will do until we help to actively co-ordinate the world vaccination programme. It seems to be causing the conservative party to fight like cats in a sack which gives me some pleasure and at least makes Labour look unites, but doesn't rectify our terrible death toll - so much worse than most other countries; in spite of good devolved leadership. Yes, vaccinations have been brilliantly invented, ordered and administered and for that I'm grateful - being one of the 'vulnerable'. But our leadership has been poor-to-non-existent and has lacked any kind of coherent, regular messaging. This 'Brexit' government was poorly prepared and inexperienced, and our Prime Minister a cad and a bounder, yet even he appears more kind and socially inclined when compared to his awful, right-wing back-benches who'd like to call the shots. People like me have been lucky through the pandemic so far, knowing few people who got Covid, whose communities grew closer, and who never had to worry about jobs and money in our retired affluence. My daughter and granddaughter haven't suffered too much as we were able to form one household, and although my son and family were cut off from me they had his in-laws. Rising energy bills is a very interesting one! My smart meter flashes 'overbudget' almost permanently at me and to keep my little house at 16°C is costing me £100 pw. I've turned it down to 15°C and got used to wearing several upper layers, but it's still £10 a day for dual fuel. The reason it's interesting rather than devastating is because a) I can afford it b) we need to understand the terrible environmental and political cost of fossil fuels and c) in my own case it's gone up because I no longer use my fireplaces but instead use an all-renewable dual fuel supplier. I believe it's definitely worth paying for! That's not to say its not going to be a dreadful time for most users, particularly young families and older people than me. What worries me most is that we rush into more nuclear, with all the expense and danger associated with it. We need more wind and solar grants to go local with it, more geothermal; and roll on the Holy grail of fusion! In the meantime get your personal thermals on and build better housing!I'm afraid I have little to say on Owen Paterson and Prince Andrew. Those who live by the sword and have few moral scruffles die by it - eventually. In the case of the former, I think the public are now at least seeing a pattern they don't like the look of. In the case of the latter, it would be very sad to see the Queen's last months blighted by worry over this: whatever we think of monarchy, she's led a life of duty.I'm very good at giving my own opinions, aren't I? Apart from that, I don't have conversations much these days and have never read reports in the press so not much use to you on the scene either. Rather than wrap this directive up, I'll keep it on hold for the next 'event' which I have a feeling could be only hours away......!Also before I go yu wondered if I had something to say on the murder of someone who sounds like he was a very good MP. This I dismissed as a topic as just 'mental health' but of course it's a very important matter because there will always be a proportion of humans who suffer mental health problems, often exaggerated by circumstances. Sometimes prominent people, usually well-known and popular, are seen as legitimate targets for those whose brains have been adversely affected by genetics/trauma/damage and/or the difficult/complex situation in which they spent their formative years. These days its often internet sites and their 'echo chamber' groupings and information sets that have the biggest influence on these sensitive minds looking for an outlet. In the past it might have been vengeance for stolen food, or faces in the clouds or dreams. If there is an answer to this one it's better understanding of minds in trouble ie far greater mental health provision and services. That's not to say there's not what seems like a rational 'cause' behind such aggressive action, but too often the cynical leaders of such, usually political, grievances use those suffering from paranoia as their footsoldiers, sadly.Now it's the New Year, and what better way to start it than to hear that the UN has got a commitment signed by the US, UK, Russia and China not to use nuclear weapons. So we can all breathe more easily on that scene for now at least. Happy 2022!"

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to Please start each part of your Directive reply on a new sheet of paper with your MO number, gender identity,  age, marital status, the town or village where you live and your occupation or former occupation. Remember not to identify yourself or other people inadvertently within your reply. It is best to use initials instead of real names. different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. mine, muscles, slim, active, sport Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. The line drawings of naked man and naked woman from school biology text book. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I think my identity has probably had a positive influence on my health. I am not male, so I don’t feel the need to soldier on until I drop dead. I am white, so I am more likely to be the same ethnic group as the healthcare professional I see, which probably helps. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My mum Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? School did a lot of telling us not to smoke and not to take drugs. Can’t recall any actual positive advice. PE was like something out of First World War propaganda: it was all about doing your duty for the school and not letting your team-mates down. Pro patria hockey and all that. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I am very aware of my body. This is from 20 years of martial arts training. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I have already had to stop kung fu. It was full contact and I was getting injured faster than I could heal myself. I expect my endurance fitness to remain good for many years so I should be able to continue to run, swim and cycle. When the covid restrictions end, I’d like to take part in triathlons. I already take some steps to safeguard my mental health. I have an evening put aside for writing every week and I make sure that work does not “bleed over” into family life so that I am always-on. I expect this to be even more important as I age. I have some concerns about mental health during the menopause as this is already a problem for some of my friends. I try to support them now. I hope that by “paying in” in this way they will be able to support me when it’s my turn! As I get older and older I worry about whether I will ever be able to afford to retire. State pension age will be 70 for me. I have been paying into company pension schemes since I was 22, but there is no final salary pension for my generation. After all these years, I’m predicted £5000 a year. I am not yet sure how I will balance needing paid work with an aging body and mind. I am trying to pay down my mortgage and think of some alternative investments while I have a good income. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Health is only loosely related to external appearance. In swimming and running races, I am beaten by people of all ages, shapes and sizes. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I once tried to be thinner. But it made me feel sad, cold and tired all the time. Fuck that for a packet of biscuits. I’m a healthy weight for my height. Everything else is bullshit. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My mum has spent her whole fucking life on a diet. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Olay factor 15 day cream. I could live without it. I’d just be drier. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? My mum’s actual leaving-the-house ritual went like this: running late for school, be unable to find car keys. Yell, “Nobody’s going anywhere until I find my car keys!” at children. Search house in bad temper. Yell, “Well, they won’t be in there!” at children for looking in stupid places like the cutlery drawer. Find keys. Chivvy children into family Morris Marina. Give it too much gas trying to start and flood the carburetor. Wait 5 mins for it to drain slumped over steering wheel in dramatic despair while children exchange worried glances. That’s not what you meant though. All I remember about her beauty routine was that it was the 1980s so she wore blue eyeshadow. The lesson I take from this is that how mad you act makes more of an impression for good or bad than what colour your eyelids are. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I have never routinely worn makeup for work. I have a wash and brush my hair. In the days when I worked in the office instead of from home, I would wear black trousers and a smart top. For an evening out I might wear lip gloss and mascara (never could stand the pore clogging gunk that is foundation)."

Remember not to identify yourself or other people inadvertently within your reply. It is best to use initials instead of real names.  COVID-19 has disrupted life as we know it. For many of us, our daily rhythms and routines have altered significantly following different government and workplace guidelines. For some, the days may seem to have bled into each other while for others the pace of life has become more frenetic. Time is generally something that is taken for granted but the pandemic has made many of us notice it in new ways. In this Directive, we ask you to tell us how time in your daily lives may have changed– or stayed the same – as a result of the pandemic. At this moment (August 2020), as lockdown is gradually easing in the UK, we would like you to please look back on your experiences of time and COVID-19 so far, consider what it means to you for life to get ‘back to normal’ (if it is) in the present day, and imagine what you think the future might hold.   As always, please include anything that is important to you that you feel is missing from our questions.  Rhythm and routine of the day In what ways, if any, has ‘time’ in your daily life been disrupted?  In the first days of the lockdown, did your daily rhythms, routines, or habits change? If so, please say how and describe how this felt. Can you recall how these changes came about? Were they connected to specific government regulation or advice?  As we first went into lockdown I thought a lot about accounts of people who lived and work in isolation; in space, on the British Antarctic Survey and so on. I thought about the Biosphere II experiment1 and the experiment to see what we could expect when we sent people to Mars2. I remembered the findings that the crew had lost their circadian rhythms and subsequently had difficulties sleeping, concentrating and staving off depression. I determined that as far as possible, the whole family would stick to our pre-lockdown routine. So: 7:00am get up & dress 7:30am I have breakfast or exercise outdoors. Husband and child get up 8:00am Husband and child have breakfast. I start work if not an exercise day. 8:30am Child starts school work online, supervised by husband. I get back from exercise, shower and eat 9:00am Child and I tackle as much of the day's maths as possible 9:30am back to work for me 10:30am child has 20 minute break and a snack 12:30pm lunch  13:00 - 13:30 back to work for afternoon for me. School work is finished by now so husband and child might go for outdoor exercise or they might each do their own thing for the afternoon. Reading, minecraft, scratch coding for child; DIY for husband. 16:30 finish work. Go for a walk as a family. 17:30 - 18:30 Dinner  19:00 child goes for a wash 19:30 child reading in bed 20:00 child lights out 20:00 - 22:30 Adult recreational activities. (TV, reading, knitting, wednesday night is creative writing night, husband goes out on mountain bike, life admin) 22:30 bed 23:00 lights out.    1 2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARS-500   In what ways have different aspects of your life sped up or slowed down? For example, have you been furloughed from work or taken on caring responsibilities? Maybe you’ve been studying online or have taken up new hobbies. Please describe your experience of this.   Many people have spent more time than usual in their local environments. If this is the case for you, have you noticed anything in particular about the rhythms of the environment around you, such as the timing of seasons, plants, animals, the sun and the moon?  What a strange question! Surely everyone knows this stuff anyway. Perhaps city dwellers really have been astounded to discover green growing things around them - but that sounds like a pile of patronising crap made up by range rover types in the home counties, to me!  I did particularly enjoy Flying Ant Day this year. Because I was at home not doing a lot I got to watch the sparrows that live in my hedge peck up the ants as they left their hole.   Are your rhythms and routines changing again now? If so, in what ways? Do you anticipate them changing again in the future? If so, please describe how you feel about this?  It is harder for me to stick to my routine now the school holidays have come. Couldn't find any clubs or so on for the child so she is hanging about the house most days, while I try to work. Husband is an outdoor pursuits instructor and we have been trying to arrange family life so that he gets a chance to work during the summer, after all the bookings he had from Feb - August were cancelled. Unfortunately, people often want to book activities with little notice. I have to try and move important meetings or sort things out so that I can be around for the child while he's out. Sometimes she has had to entertain herself for a whole day because I am home with her but can't re-jig my schedule in time to spend all or half of the day with her. I'm using my leave to do summer child care rather than taking a break.  So now work is all at sixes and sevens and I'm constantly playing catch up. It's harder to get out of bed and start work early or go for a run now that the other two are just doing recreational activities. And the child goes to bed later leaving less evening time to relax before the next day.    Homelife For those of you spending most of your time at home, how do you make distinctions between different times of the day? Do you describe these times – to yourself or members of your household - in any new ways since lockdown? For example, do you have particular times of the day you leave the house to take a walk or have meals? What factors influence the organisation of your time?  For those of you living in households with others, how do you negotiate time in relation to one another? Do some people’s time matter more than others? Is this determined by work, caring responsibilities or maybe access to computers?  During lockdown, I became the sole earner and my husband saw his role as doing whatever it took so that I was able to carry on working from home to the best of my ability. The plan was that if the company had to make redundancies, he wanted me to have the best chance of not being laid off. For that reason, my time was considered more important on weekdays, but at the weekend I “owed” him time to do whatever he wanted as he’d been on homeschool and childcare duties all week.  In the holiday period, he has taken some bookings and been able to earn some money, so the balance has shifted again. It works like this: S has an online booking form for customers. Most days show him “unavailable” which actually means he’s looking after our daughter while I work. He leaves a couple of days a week free for customers to book and I take those as annual leave. We had a couple of cock ups where I work from home and look after a bored child at the same time. The logic behind this is to try to keep husband’s business going as it is kind of a hedge against my employer.  Each of us likes to have an evening off for recreation. S likes to have a night mountain biking and I like one Writing Night a week. S likes his ride to be a movable feast. In contrast I prefer it if Wednesday Night is Writing Night. And there are rules for writing night: No drinking, it doesn’t matter which piece of writing you work on but you must write, if someone is daft enough to speak to you on writing night they can’t expect more than a grunt in return.  In what ways have your lives come to be ‘in synch’ with or at odds with one another over the period of lockdown?  What changes do you anticipate in the time of your homelife in the future?  HR have advised tech staff to continue to work from home until January 2021.   I imagine this will mean much more involvement in V’s school, which is both a good and a bad thing. Previously as S mostly worked from home and I mostly worked from the office, he did the majority of the taking and collecting. If school needed to phone us, it would usually be S that they could reach.  Media and technology Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to family or colleagues using online tools, having online medical appointments and/or shopping online? If so, has using these tools made a difference to how you manage, schedule or plan your time?   Did other materials – for example, notepads, diaries, wall calendars – feature as well? What did you use them for?   If you used new media, technologies or materials, or changed how you used them as a result of COVID-19, do you anticipate that you will keep using them in the same way in the future? The Spring Directive included a similar question. If you answered it, have your views changed?  S and I have had a shared google calendar for years, now. If you want to do something, you must put it in the calendar. Without official notification, via the calendar, your spouse has no obligation to fall into line with your plans. Working days, non-working days, child social occasions, medical appointments, MOT expiries etc are all in the calendar. Now that I see S every day, I don’t think I’ve looked at it for weeks. I’ve not had much to put in it, either.  There is also the calendar for S’s online booking form. That now determines when he will let people book him.  Waiting For some people, it seems as if life has been put ‘on hold’ during the pandemic. Does this feel relevant to you? If so, please say how. Have you experienced a particular pause or a delay, for instance in waiting for appointments, activities, a new job or for work to resume?   Compared to some, I don't think I've been badly affected at all.  The biggest wait is waiting to see what will happen in September. My daughter's school plans to open but what if my town becomes another Leicester in the meantime? I am trying to avoid buying any uniform until I know for sure it will actually be used!  I'd like to change jobs, but many of my programmer friends are unemployed right now. Since I have a job I think I'll just sit tight in it for the time being.  My half-arsed triathlon ambitions are also on hold. There are no competitions this year and the only official training sessions are a couple of runs a week.  What is your experience of waiting? For example, you may have spent time queuing outside shops, waiting for deliveries, or waiting to see friends or family. Please describe how these times felt.  For those who have been directly or indirectly affected by illness during the pandemic, how have you experienced time and waiting in particular in relation to incapacity, recovery, loss and grief?"

His Royal Highness? Prince? Duke of York? Are we still supposed to be living in some kind of children's fairy tale land where the subjects are meant to look up to a small number of privileged people with bizarre titles who wear ludicrous uniforms and enjoy anything involving marching? It seems we are. I find it astounding that so many UK citizens treat the royal family with such admiration and awe. I have friends with left wing political views who adore the royals and don't see any contradiction in this. Some of them would say that most of the royals are a waste of space but the Queen is marvellous (and William and Kate and Princess Anne) and the pageantry (those fabulous weddings!) is uplifting and whatever would we replace them with? Something far less colourful that was bound to be worse.How perfectly decent people (some of them celebrities) can bring themselves to kneel in front of one of the royals and accept an 'honour' from them, I've no idea. The specific language they're told to use, the bowing and curtseying, the deference required...it's stomach churning. Kudos to the ones who turn the offer down. Why haven't we got an honours system that avoids the royals and any mention of the British Empire yet still allows people to be rewarded for their good works? I'm not including retired politicians here, who seem to get honours just for having been politicians. So back to the unmitigated horror that is his Princely Highnessy Royal Dukeness, who from now on I will call PA, because Andrew sounds a bit too chummy. Well, he's come across as a distasteful character for a long time now - a posturing idiot who just expects to be provided with a lavish lifestyle as his birthright without actually doing anything to earn it. His ex-wife seems to be cut from the same cloth too. Why did he and Sarah ever split up? Theirs was a marriage made up of billions of flashing £ signs, so...a perfect match. PA seems to have got himself into a current nightmare by, like other fallen rich and privileged types, believing that he can do pretty much what he likes because, a) The Rules (of law and of society in general) don't apply to him, and b) there'll always be someone around to get him out of any sticky situation should it be necessary. I have just steeled myself to watch the infamous November 2019 Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, not having seen anything but short clips from it before, and it was excruciating. I watched most of it through my fingers. Here was a man showcasing his arrogance and displaying a total lack of understanding as to the effects of his actions on the young woman involved. He blustered his way through it, showing no humility and no contrition, making jaw-dropping comments such as that sex crimes were 'unbecoming' behaviour, and that he didn't regret his association with Jeffrey Epstein because he'd got a lot of benefits from it in terms of introductions to some very useful contacts.From what I've read/heard, the bones of the case are as follows:PA was pals with Ghislaine Maxwell who introduced him to her once (?) boyfriend, Jeffrey Epstein, an American 'financier'. This was after PA's divorce when he was single and carefree again (Yeh!). During visits to JE's various luxury apartments/mansions/island hideouts/private jets, PA never cottoned on to JE's sexual proclivities or paid much attention to the number of young girls that seemed to be around giving massages to older me. He was too used to the presence of 'servants' to remark on that. But in 2008, JE was convicted of sexual offences. According to PA the conviction did give him pause for though and after JE was released, PA decided to go to New York, in 2010, to JE face to face (the only honourable way) that their friendship (which had never been close) was off. During the three day visit, PA stayed in JE's mansion because it was 'convenient'. They parted amicably but somehow they did manage to bump into each other again on more than one occasion. In 2014, Virginia Giuffre, one of the above young girls in JE's circle, alleged that PA had had sex with her several times when she was a minor under US law. She produced a photo of PA with his arm round her and with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background, and claimed that she had been pressurised and threatened by JE and GM to comply. PA said he had no memory of ever having met her and it was possible that the photo was a fake.The accusations rumbled on and in November 2019, PA agreed to the Newsnight interview, erroneously thinking it would be a great opportunity to come across as a good chap and clear his name. Sadly for him, he came across as arrogant and stupid and his reasons for why he was innocent (his inability to sweat, being in Pizza Express in Woking at the time) were ridiculed across the globe. Immediately after the interview, all his public duties were cancelled so that the changes of him embarrassing the Palace further were minimised. In August 2021, Virginia Giuffre brought a civil lawsuit against PA and much ducking and diving from PA and his lawyers ensued which included trying to blame VG for this and that (being involved in sex trafficking herself, having signed a non-disclosure agreement), and it all sounded increasingly whiny and desperate. By then, JE was dead (suicide while in prison again) and GM was about to be convicted of sex trafficking. Thou shalt know a man by the company he keeps...In January 2022, the Palace seemed to have had enough and PA was stripped of a ton of royal titles (they have so many - who invents them all?), including HRH, and his social media accounts were closed. The nation (especially me) waited agog for the case to go to trial so we could see what sort of a hash PA would make of testifying - the Newsnight interview blown up to gigantic proportions - when in February 2022...the case was settled out of course. Huge sums were to be handed over, partly funded by the sale of PA's skiing chalet in Verbier, but we were being denied a satisfying outcome.There is much talk of where the money is going to come from. Will the Queen pay up? Will a single penny come from the UK taxpayer - perish the thought. Will we ever find out, because the details of the royal family's wealth are notoriously murky. However huge the sum required, they can easily afford it because they own numerous properties, vast tracts of land, countless precious jewels and artworks and are rich beyond the dreams of most of their 'subjects', some of whom, as I write this are plucking up courage to go a food bank for the first time and/or wondering how they are going to pay their fuel bills. And young, vulnerable women and girls will continue to be exploited by monsters like Jeffrey Epstein and his pals, some of them gormless twits like PA (I'm being kind to him here) who might at the time have been thinking, 'Wow, smiling young girls willing to do anything to please me - all my Christmases really have come at once.'PA will probably live out the rest of his life in royal comfort while being unable to do x, y and z. And part of his tiny brain will forever be muttering: but I didn't do anything wrong! Why can't I wear that uniform any more - I looked really good in that one. I bet Charles is going to be beastly to me when Mummy dies. Etc, etc. Well, tough."

We always wash any food container prior to putting in our bag and flatten any cardboard. We live on a narrowboat so we keep the bag in the engine room out of sight. We don’t have a huge amount of space, so we use a large ‘bag for life’ and when it is full, we take it to the recycling bins provided by the Canal and River Trust. This is a 5-10 minute walk from our mooring. The bins provided are one for general waste, one for glass and one for other dry mixed recycling. We put a lot of plastic in the recycling that I think must have been recycled before – soft fruit trays being one-that I’m not really sure are suitable, but I put them in anyway. I think the recycling bins for the houses are collected fortnightly in the area we are moored in. Unlike at our house in Bolton, where we had 4 different wheelie bins for separating recycling and waste, here in Cheshire they are still using a mixture of wheelie bin for waste and plastic tubs for recycling. I’ve not studied them, but most houses seem to have at least two separate tubs alongside their waste bin. The only things we don’t recycle are egg boxes and toilet/kitchen roll tubes. The are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, we use them to light our wood burning stove in winter and our fire pit in the summer. Secondly, some of the egg boxes are from the free range egg stall in the village, so we return them. In all honesty, I don’t really know how much of our recycling ends up in landfill but I do know that some of the items may end up being burned to produce electricity and the vast majority will be genuinely recycled. I work on an industrial estate with a waste sorting facility and they have a huge conveyer with operatives sorting commercial waste, it’s super busy! There is obviously money to be made from rubbish! I certainly try not to buy overly packaged items but it can be difficult. I like to shop at our local farm shop every now and again, but the cost is prohibitive. I don’t mind paying extra for fresh, better tasting, seasonal fruit and veg but I simple can’t afford to. It is an affluent area and the prices reflect this. I could travel to the market in the nearby town but the saving I make would be cancelled out by more car miles. I also work full time and so, like most people, for convenience I shop at the supermarket I drive past on my way home from work once a week. I don’t think my habits have changed at all during the past year or because of Covid. We have recycled for years (we also compost our food waste) and nothing about our personal circumstances changed very much (we were both still working full time). The only thing that really changed was our location, we changed our mooring from Burscough in West Lancashire on the Leeds Liverpool canal to Northwich in Cheshire of the Trent and Mersey canal. The nearby recycling facilities at our new mooring are much better which saves us taking it to the bins provided at the local supermarket, which is what we had to do before."

The rise of the omicron variant has made me more cautious about going out and mixing with people.  This is as much about not assisting in the spread of this variant as protecting myself.  The more people who have vaccinations, including boosters the better it will be for people, enabling some normality and protecting people. I am happy to continue to wear a mask when in shops, and I continued to do so when restrictions were relaxed earlier this year.  I think that the wearing of masks in shops and crowed venues should have continued, not only as a way of protection but also as a way of reminding people that the pandemic is not yet over. I ask myself what is normality.  This changes over the years because of changing circumstances.  When I was young going abroad was unusual, certainly not normal, now many people expect to be able to go on holiday abroad, and seem to think their rights are being infringed because they are restrictions.  (Death from Covid is quite restrictive to a person.)   Also when I was young, even when I was at university, parties where not the norm, and nightclubs were not visited by the majority of students.  Now many young people accept them as the norm and think they are missing out on their life.  I cannot see what was considered to be normality returning for quite a while.  It might lead to a new normality, with what might be thought of as restrictions becoming accepted as the norm.  I think back to the compulsory wearing of seatbelts when I was younger as an example of how a behaviour has been become accepted.  Before seatbelts were to become compulsory there was much talk about it being a restriction on freedom, but now it is the norm to use one.  With the surge of the omicron variant I will accept further restrictions, even a lock-down, to protect people.  Some Conservative politicians seemed more concerned about protecting the economy than people.  The economy is an abstractions, people are real. More recently the number of omicron cases has been increasing rapidly leading to many people self-isolating, and shortage of staff.  Many people seem to have reduced their social interactions because of the omicron variant.  Both these will effect the economy.  I cannot but think that more restrictions might have been a better approach, and actually reduce the economic impact over the long term. Energy Companies When some energy companies when bust I wondered how useful is competition for something as basic as energy.  Also I wondered how easy it was for energy companies to be set up. It seems that the companies that hit problems had a relatively large number of customers on standard tariffs, and not very many on contracts.  This meant that they were more dependent on buying energy, particularly gas, on the spot market, and more likely to incur higher charges which they could not Autumn 2021 Part 3 1 of 3 4 January 2022 MO 3231 Male, 72 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) pass on to their customers.  It seems to be a poor thought out business plan.  This assumption seems to have been that prices where going to remain fairly steady.  It does not take much effect to think of many examples where there has been financial shocks to the economy.  Even before Covid there was the financial crisis, the crisis over the European Exchange Mechanism, the first Gulf War, and even further back the hike in petrol prices in the 1970s. What certainty crossed my mind was that the government could, and maybe should, set up a Quango to buy energy for the nation, and so be able to set up contracts which would ensure more stable prices, even if they are rising steadily.  I would have thought that more gas storage is a must for keeping stable prices, but I read that such facilities had been shut down..                                              Red Poppies I have not bought a red poppy for a long time.  One of my grandfathers fought, and was wounded in the First World War, and was suffering nightmares about it many years later.  I cannot remember seeing him wear a poppy. It seems that if people who are in the public eye are criticised for not wearing poppies. This is something I object to. Why should people be forced to conform. This seemed to start some years ago, and there was more pressure to wear poppies and my reaction was to stop buying poppies. I do think that a charity to support veterans on the armed forces should be unnecessary.  It should be the Government who should be giving support.  Such charities allow the Government to avoid their responsibility. Government Sleaze and Corruption Writing this after the North Shropshire by-election it seems quite an own goal by the government.  If Owen Patterson had accepted that he had broke the rules and accepted his punishment and wonder it the effect on the government would have been limited.  Boris Johnson trying to protect Owen Patterson looked incompetent, a heavy dose of cronyism, and accepting of practices which looked dubious. It is good that it did mean that the earnings of MPs from sources outside parliament was brought out in the open. It always amazes me how much MPs can get paid for consultancy work.  I often wonder what they do for the money.  It does not take much effort to come to the conclusion that they are not paid as much for the consultancy as for their influence in parliament.  It all seems to much to me, and I believe that there should be restrictions on what MPs can do, and what they can earn.  Some years ago when they was much concern over MPs earnings from outside parliament I thought that the money they get paid for being an MP should be reduced in proportion of how much they are getting form other sources.  I suppose that people with money can always found ways to get around regulations, though that does not mean it should not be tried.  Christmas Parties The recent stories of Christmas Parties held last year in various government departments, when the country was under various restrictions had caused me a certain amount of amusement, and a certain amount of annoyance. Autumn 2021 Part 3 2 of 3 4 January 2022 MO 3231 Male, 72 Years Old, Single Residence -Hindley Green, Wigan Occupation Physicist (Retired) I do find it amusing just thinking how in government must feel after having been caught out having Christmas parties.  Though I suppose I am assuming that they may feel some embarrassment at breaking rules.  I have mine suspicions that they do not think that they had broken the rules, and that they think that they are being unfairly treated.  The annoyance I feel is that either they thought that they could get away with it, or else they thought that they were not breaking the rules.  In either case no one seems to have thought about the effect it would have it if came out that parties had been held, on trust in the government’s policies on restrictions, or on people’s behaviour. I hope that there is a lesson here for the people involved, and that is that actions have consequences, and this should be considered before hand.  HRH Prince Andrew At times I hope he ends up in prison.  People who are wealthy, and in a position of status or power, seem to think that they can get away with behaviour that most people would not deem acceptable, and they usually get away with it.  Although I have not followed this story in detail Prince Andrew has given a very unconvincing defence of his encounter with a Virginia Giuffre.  I suspect if he was engaged in sex with a minor he will get away with it.      Autumn 2021 Part 3 3 of 3 4 January 2022"

I had to get tested in order to go to a hospital appointment.  We drove to a car park near the out-patients department of the hospital at an appointed time (arranged by a phone call from the hospital). Someone came out and administered the test while I stayed in the car. It was most unpleasant!  Then we drove away.  If it had been positive they would have rung to cancel the appointment but I heard nothing, so it was clearly negative and I was able to keep the appointment. We did send away for a pack of the free NHS test at home kits, as a ‘just in case’ scenario.  My husband and I have each administered one of these – more out of curiosity than anything else, both negative. The tests are quite uncomfortable to do, but the instructions were clear enough to follow. I know the government have been encouraging everyone to administer these home tests twice a week as a precautionary thing, but I doubt that many people are doing that.   It’s a good idea, but I think we are all so weary, we can’t be bothered unless we have symptoms or are going to a special event. We should have travelled to France on 25th July at which time it was necessary to take a PCR test to travel. Booking this online through Boots was a nightmare. The site was so user unfriendly, and assumed a lot of prior knowledge which I didn’t have. I had to take and upload images of our passports (at least I think that’s what they wanted – it really wasn’t clear). Eventually we were given appointments in Cambridge City Centre – some half an hour away. In the end we cancelled the trip, because of the worsening Covid situation in both countries.  Subsequently we did travel to France, but by then the necessity for pre-travel testing had been cancelled. We will have to have tests before we travel back to the UK – bookable at a local pharmacy, results within 20 minutes. We also have to pre-book Day 2 tests for when we get home. The reference number for this test is required when we travel back, or we won’t be allowed out of the country. There’s been a lot of online conversation about these Day 2 tests. The Government has a list of private companies that offer the service, and apparently the prices range from £20 to £80. Most people seem to be opting for the cheapest test, but when they get back to the UK often the tests don’t arrive, or don’t arrive in time, and people don’t always get the results.  It really does seem the companies are laughing all the way to the bank.  I’ve read in an online user group that people aren’t bothered about that – all they really need is the reference number on their cross-channel booking.  It’s a total rip-off. As for accuracy of the tests, I guess there is some concern, but on the whole I feel they are pretty much accurate. Test and Trace I did download the NHS test and trace app and have used it when going to coffee shops. One of the things that occurs to me is that without a smartphone, life would be difficult. If we didn’t have a laptop and smartphone each we wouldn’t have been able to travel to France. I think it’s a good idea, but when it was first started, it seemed like a very expensive fiasco. Dido Harding’s involvement was typical of the way the government has badly handled things. I haven’t been contacted by being in contact with anyone, although my daughter was -twice – and self isolated as required, and was fine. When the number of contacts became very high, I’m sure there will have been people who called in to work saying they’d been ‘pinged’ when they hadn’t, just to get a week off work. There would be nothing to prove otherwise!"

I will give it my best shot, but I will do so with a very broad brush in order that I do not finish my afternoon pacing around my house in a ball of rage. Mass Observation have started their introduction to this directive with the following; We have made a list of events you might wish to write about: COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality”.  Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust”.  The centenary of the red poppy, a show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921. The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess.      The  conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn.   The  lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York.   Please take some time to comment on any of these subjects, or on any other items from the news, which you feel we should be covering at this time. When it comes to the list above, there is no good news is there? Apart perhaps the centenary of the red poppy appeal on behalf of the Royal British Legion. But that in itself was brought about by the inescapable fact that it was desperately needed in order to give some aid to those affected by the mechanical slaughter and destruction of the Great War. The country, or at least its population, turned to charitable aims in order that some alleviation be brought to those left to suffer the most dreadful injuries and loss. And here we are one hundred years later, a full century later, and there is still need of such charity. Have we learned nothing? Or is it a case that we’re happy to send our armed service personnel to involve them in conflicts in Iraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere? Or at least we allow our government to do so on our behalf. Since that list was drawn up we have a new kid on the block, the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the virulent one, the scary one, the one that we’re all going to catch. Listening to the news reports on the television or the radio, and the debates and phone-ins that follow the news reports, we can either believe we’re all doomed to a horrible death sometime between Christmas day and Valentines, or we’ll need to wrap up warm with a water bottle and some paracetamol and not worry about it. Add to that little problem the fact that the public are finally beginning to see through the lies, bluster and bullshit that passes for governance these days. Johnson, the great lying oaf that he is, has been caught out in yet more lies regarding office parties taking place in Downing Street itself, exactly one year ago. The rest of us were told that Christmas was cancelled and funerals were limited to twenty or thirty people and no hymns were to be sung. I was to attend the funeral of my own Uncle under such conditions. There was no wake, no sandwiches or beer, no catch-up with members of the greater family, no shared laughter or tears at stories retold from back in the day. We tossed a rose into the grave atop of his coffin and a handful of sand, and we all went home again. Every Prime Minister has a use by date. Regardless of how popular they were/are at the start of their tenure, waving back to the crowds of Union Jack wavers cheering them in through the gates of Downing Street. Stood on the doorstep of Number Ten itself hugging their spouse and speaking of hope, harmony, peace and prosperity to the television cameras. Sooner or later, they will be booed and heckled back out again by the very same people that put them there in the first place. It happened to Margaret Thatcher, it happened to Tony Blair too. Though I think they had three General Election victories apiece, they stayed just that little too long for their own good. Boris the liar however, seems to have worn out his welcome within a couple of years. Scandals of sleaze, cronyism, contracts worth millions given out to mates from school, cash for questions in the House, pretty secretary’s taken on junkets abroad, private flats renovated by “donations”, Covid restrictions flouted, and all of it, absolutely everything, denied and denied again. Lies, bluster and bullshit. Month after month after month. He’s simply toxic, his position untenable. But I also say that knowing full well that if there were an election called this next Thursday, he’d probably win it.  For we have “dumbed down” to the point that probably half of the electorate simply shrug their shoulders and give a sigh; “I can’t be arsed with it, they’re all the same.” As a country we are teetering between “business as usual” and another lockdown. No-one is using the term “lockdown”, heaven forbid, no, no absolutely not. But there is a lot of “circuit breaker”, “Plan B”, “Plan C”, “Work from home if you can, and please lets have some common sense.” Well I’m going to put myself out on a limb here and say there is no common sense. Common sense would have kept the lying odious twat out of politics for life when he was first caught out lying to the House years ago. To be sacked from his position for telling lies, by one Tory Prime Minister is bad enough, to be sacked twice by another Tory Prime Minister for lying again, is simply preposterous. Yet his party put him into the position he now holds, knowing full well that he’s a philandering, work shy, blustering, bullshitter and a chancer. No, I don’t want to talk about events in the country right now. We are rudderless. I need to wait, bide my time, and concentrate on the things I can control. Which is very little at the moment. But I’ll concentrate on my family, our health, our happiness and the rest of it can go to hell. We’re heading that way anyway.  December 2021."

Married. Barrow-in-Furness. Retired Prison Officer. Spring Directive 2020. Part 2: Covid-19. (Update). Health. I'm beginning to formulate in my own head some issues that I'm uncomfortable thinking about right now, to the extent that I'm keeping them to myself for the time being for fear of upsetting my wife, or at least causing her some unease. She maybe harbouring similar thoughts herself for all I know, and perhaps she's keeping her own counsel for fear of causing me to worry, it wouldn't surprise me if that is the case, but let me start at the beginning and get it off my chest and into print. For two months now, we seem to have grown used to these new temporary norms that we accept and abide by. Social distancing, queueing without fuss outside the supermarket waiting to be allowed entry. Stepping to one side on a footpath if others are walking towards you, or should they do that in order to allow me to pass at a safe distance, then having the courtesy to thank them for doing so. For most of this period we've had to stay at home because there's been nowhere to go. The shops are shut, the pubs are shut, our friends all being in the same boat are likewise keeping their distance and so no longer drop by for a brew and a chat. We've been told to get ourselves out for a bit of exercise each day, an hours worth at any rate, for a walk, jog, or bike ride. And plenty have done so, me included some days, but not all, and strictly only at a walking pace for me. But what if this isn't temporary? What if this is now set to become the new normal? If this virus continues to mutate and swing back and forth across the continents causing infections in great waves each time it passes, like flu or the common cold but only on a deadly scale, year after year, what then? In March my wife and I went to Portugal for a pleasant ten day holiday, we arrived back home about two or three days before the airports shut down altogether. We didn't think of it then, but that may actually be our last foreign holiday ever. Whole industries that we took for granted are currently in great danger of withering to death. The holiday market being just one. It includes of course, airline companies, hotels, coach companies, car hire, restaurants, theatre's, cinemas, museums, bars, basically anything that I would like to do whilst on holiday is quite likely to drop to its knees and perish. Be it in Portugal, Spain, the isle of Crete or even here in Cumbria. The tourist industry has now ground to a halt. The rest of the service industries are reeling in a similar fashion. So far we've had a mild spring without much rain, and I'm looking forward to a pleasant and warm summer too. But I wouldn't want to put up with this state of affairs if having to live through a Russian winter. Or more pertinently an English one for that matter. Queuing outside Asda for forty minutes with my back turned against the driving rain, shivering with the cold like a dog, and knowing you can't go home without the basic foods like bread, potato's, eggs and some meat. Knowing you can't give in to it and go home empty handed. I don't like to even imagine it, but what if this “temporary” becomes the reality, the new normal? Fuck that. Some folk may read the above paragraphs and wonder if my mental health is beginning to fray at the edges a little. It isn't, not yet at any rate. My main concerns right now are the prospects for my local football team Barrow AFC, who were top of the National League by four clear points with only seven games left of the season to play, when it was decided that the league program was to be brought to a halt due to the virus. Are they to be declared champions and promoted back into the English Football League after an absence of forty-eight years? A lot of people in this town are tossing and turning in their beds at night over that little conundrum. My wife D on the other hand does have some health concerns that need to be considered. She's sixty-one years of age, and up to now if memory serves me right, she's had a triple heart bypass, and a carotid artery bypass whilst the surgeon at Blackpool Royal Victoria was at it. She's an insulin dependant diabetic, has been diagnosed as having COPD, though no medication is yet being prescribed for that condition, takes some tablets or other to keep her blood pressure at a regular level, and suffers chronic pains in her right leg, her back, and both feet. Should she come into contact with Covid-19 I'd have to fear for her life. This is something else I don't like to dwell upon. As for myself, I've had to put up with a sore mouth from a gum infection from before we went on holiday. I've undergone two courses of an antibiotic prescribed for me by my dentist. The second course only being finished four days past. The pain I've been suffering has subsided somewhat, and for that I'm thankful. I've been taking eight Paracetamol and a four high strength Ibuprofen per day for over two months to manage the pain, though these past two days I've cut that down by a quarter. My main concern on this issue is that dental surgeries are not operating at all right now, anywhere. If this gum infection were to lead to a worse condition, involving more pain, what then? D has done an outstanding job of looking after herself so far, mainly by stopping in the house, though occaisionaly she sits in the garden soaking up a little sunshine if its warm enough. She can get from one end of her day to the other without moaning about her lot, and has always kept her humour, which makes life much easier for me. Yesterday was our thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, a quiet affair, and after all these years we seem to be getting the hang of married life. We tend to bump along the road without much drama, now that our two daughters have left home, at least. To celebrate our milestone we shared a bottle of Prosecco whilst watching a couple of dreadful films on Netflix, then moved on to a bottle of Scotch and some chocolates. The films didn't improve any, but we didn't seem to care about it, funny that, eh? The Government. Where to start? I'm a socialist by birth and an atheist by choice, and I hold no regard for the Conservative Party, its membership, or its financiers. So there is always an “out” on offer for someone reading my views, or hearing them spoken and not agreeing with them. They always have the option of dismissing them as the biased, one sided rantings of a socialist who has the luxury of an easy lifestyle. That bothers me not one jot. Here we go. Boris Alexander de Pfeffel Johnson has been the country's Prime Minister since the last useless Tory Prime Minister stepped down. If May was out of her depth whilst kicking the Brexit can along the road for three wasted years, then this fool Johnson is drowning in front of us. He's simply gone missing. Let us make no bones about it, the ineptitude of this country's leadership has turned a difficult situation into a national disaster beyond compare outside of wartime. This virus was seen coming over the hill all the way from China back in December of last year, yet the United Kingdom continued kicking the can down the country lane like a schoolboy on a lazy summers afternoon. Swishing a twig before him, swiping at the heads of dandelions in the hedgerow whilst dreaming of slaying Johnny Foreigner with his mighty cutlass, Johnson padded forward down the lane soaking up the adoration of his loyal citizens, and once back in reach of the can, he aimed a mighty kick and sent it spinning and clattering further down the lane in front of him. “Young Johnson shoots... he scores... he's done it, Boris has won the World Cup for England... and the crowd ROOOOOAAAAARRR.....” “Excuse me Prime Minister....” “Eh, oh.. what is it, forgive me I was... err miles away old chap, what can I do for you?” “There is a very worrying situation developing in China, Prime Minister. There appears to be a rather virulent outbreak of a dangerous virus sir, could kill tens of thousands we hear, and its very possible that this virus could spread rather quickly sir, eventually even Europe may have to deal with it.” “But China is an awfully long way off isn't it? I mean surely the Chinese are just the very sort to handle anything of this nature surely?” “We believe they're doing there very best sir, they have quarantined over half a billion of their citizens, and the Red Army are squirting disinfectant around on an industrial scale, but we fear it might yet travel, so to speak.” “Half a billion locked away in their own houses? Wonderful stuff, damned sharp are these Chinese you know, won't have any nonsense from the riff-raff. What are the Americans thinking on this? What's Donald saying? “President Trump is saying that this is a hoax Prime Minister. Fake news designed to undermine the US economy and their record breaking numbers on the Stock Market, and nothing for the God fearing, gun toting citizens of America to worry about.” “Very wise, I suggest we mirror the USA on this matter, for the time being at least. Besides, didn't we do some sort of exercise on just such a scenario a couple of years back?” “As it happens, yes we did Prime Minister.” “Well, how did that go?” “Dreadfully sir, we were found to be totally unprepared for any such pandemic should one arise. We have neither the infrastructure, equipment or medical staff in sufficient numbers to stop a disaster sir. We need to act now, or the consequences could be on a biblical scale Prime Minister.” “Oh do come along man, please lets not have that defeatist clap-trap. Put this in the hands of our Minister for Health, let him handle it, there's a good chap.” A parody? Maybe, but since those early days when we first heard of the city of Wuhan in China, the government have sat on their hands and done nothing. Think of the Cheltenham Festival being allowed to go ahead, they dithered and prevaricated, whilst airports remained open allowing hundreds of thousands to continue to enter the country unchecked and unscreened from everywhere in the world, every week, including China. And let's not forget the three thousand or more that flew into Liverpool from Madrid to watch a football match, when the hospitals of Madrid at that very same time were being kept busier than the airport there. The rest is known and noted down by better men than me, but the official figures of the dead are now treated as a macabre joke. Apart from the the United States of America, who frankly deserve all they get, Britain has the worst death rate in the world from this virus, though Brazil and Russia will be in the mix soon enough too. The government couldn't have made a worst fist of it had they deliberately tried to do so. We've had more confusion, conflicting instructions, and woolly headedness whilst all the public have wanted was to receive sound and useful advice from a strong leader. Whereas Boris has simply disappeared. He eventually turned up in Saint Thomas's Hospital to be hidden away whilst being given oxygen, having told us that he himself went down with the virus. After that he fucked off to Chequers for a fortnight and hid in the bathroom, sat on the toilet crying whilst waiting for the tablets to kick in. He put in a brief appearance after the birth of his latest child, but has since disappeared again. The country of Australia meanwhile has started to open up and get back to work, a sense of normality is returning there after less than a hundred lives were lost to the virus. Think of that, the number of dead counted in double figures. (Actually its 100 exactly, I just checked) Whereas today (19th May) we've announced that 35,341 have so far died due to the virus in the UK. New Zealand's figure is I believe 21. (I checked that too). But even the figures issued by our government don't add up right. I was listening to a program on BBC Radio 2 recently, where it had been explained that the government had conceded that “some 8,000” deaths had occurred inside care homes for the month of April due to the virus, and hadn't been included in the official toll, yet. But the Office of National Statistics inform us that for the previous five years, during the month of April, we can expect 8,000 to die within our care homes. That is the average number, give or take a couple of hundred, for each of the past five Aprils from 2015 – 2019. This April however, saw the number of deaths recorded at a whopping 26,000 and change. So that accounts for 8,000 we'd expect to see die in any given April, plus the extra 8,000 that the government have accepted as Covid related deaths, but this still leaves approximately 10,000 unaccounted for. What did those poor souls die of? The Care Home “industry” is now coming under close scrutiny, and not surprisingly, and not before time either. How have so many of our elderly succumbed whilst being looked after inside such places? How on earth has it happened? And in such appallingly large numbers? That a single care home in England can lose more of its residents in a fortnight, than the entire country of New Zealand loses from its population throughout the entire epidemic so far, is nothing short of institutionalised criminal negligence on a breathtaking scale. And its been happening week in, week out, all over the country. And I for one am appalled, in fact I'm fucking outraged by such events. Each Thursday night we're being asked to stand on our streets and applaud our health workers, and yet we're sat in our armchairs thinking; “Only 545 dead today, that's not too bad is it? We might be turning a corner here, how long before we can get the football back on telly do you think?” Do not get me wrong on this score, I apportion no blame whatsoever upon those that work either in the NHS or the Social Care sector, none at all. These people are more often than not working at, or very close to, the national minimum wage. In some cases, to pay them one penny less would actually be against the law. Many of these people have worked with sub standard protective gear and they kept going until they themselves became infected. Many have died. This whole shambles needs to be addressed properly, within a full and frank public enquiry. Anything less would be tantamount to us shrugging our shoulders, spitting on the floor and walking away. My home town of Barrow-in-Furness is the worst hit in the entire country. This is one table we didn't need to be top of. How and why we're the nations Covid hotspot is a matter of debate, but the nations press, including television cameras have been quick to point out our misery and misfortune. “Whilst every town and city throughout the land has been affected to some degree or other, come and look at these filthy fuckers rolling around in their squalor. Unemployment, drug addiction, obesity, teenage pregnancies, squalid housing and a total lack of self respect has seen the town of Barrow-in-Furness declared as officially the nations shit hole. There is literally nowhere worse than here.” The Daily Mail has actually asked if Barrow-in-Furness may become a pariah town? Cheers Daily Mail, why don't you just give us the title and fuck off back to your homes in Surrey or Berkshire or wherever, and thank your lucky stars you don't have to live here among us. Thanks for fuck all. There's no need to ask why its this way here, no need to offer us any assistance, no need to champion our community spirit and highlight some of the hard work being put in by ordinary folk trying to make it better. No need to lobby on our behalf, don't put yourselves out. Just you hang that title around our necks, and whilst your at it, why not remind everyone that we had that unfortunate outbreak of Legionnaires Disease here some twenty years past. Yes, that was us too. You're welcome. I'm taking a break from these notes for now, maybe a day or two. I can easily come across as an angry man, I know that. But I'm really not angry at all, if anything I'm saddened by it all. I may even accept I'm doing the Daily Mail a degree of disservice, after all I haven't read their piece, I wouldn't have the fucking rag in the house. But Barrow-in-Furness doesn't do wealth, it never has done. It was born of the Industrial Revolution to turn Iron Ore into steel. To make someone else wealthy by turning a hard earned mineral mined from the bowels of the earth into cash, for someone else. The railway, the steelworks, the docks, the shipyard, the tenements, the schools, the council estates, they all came afterwards, eventually. And none of it was built to look pretty. But there's no need to kick us whilst we're down, for the truth is we're struggling to be up most of the time anyway, and a lot of us are hurting right now. This country's leadership, such as it is, has let us down. And badly so. Work and home life. I'm fortunate that I'm a retired Prison Officer, and I sure as Hell wouldn't want to be a serving one right now, that I can guarantee. I did twenty-seven years service for Her Majesty, and know of murderers that did a lot less. But I've since grown used to the fact that I don't actually have to do something in order to receive a wage. My pension, unspectacular though it is, provides us with the means to live at a decent standard. And so this dreadful pandemic has caused nought but a ripple to my daily routine, and I'm thankful for that much at least. I know from listening to radio shows on the BBC that some people are coming under dreadful stress as they see their businesses stagnate through their doors being locked shut. I feel for them, and I hope they have something left to work with once we have the opportunity to return to whatever passes for normal in the future. My own gripes and grouses are that I pine for the opportunity to visit my grandchildren and hug them. And my love of the sport of Crown Green Bowls has been stopped dead this season, stopped before the season started. Normally I'd be playing competitive bowls twice a week at least, and practising for no less than two hours a day, five days a week, often three hours a day if the green is free for me to do so. These are but piddling nuisances in the grand scheme of things right now, I shan't dwell on them. Of more importance is the continued support I can offer my Dad, he lives alone and has done for twelve summers or thereabouts since Mam died. Dad has Alzheimer's and so struggles from time to time. At the moment he's able to get by with the help and support that my brother, sister and myself are able to offer him. The Furness Carers Society recognise the three of us as Dad's primary carers, and in turn they are there to offer us advice and assistance should we need or ask for it. Up to now we're doing OK. We see that Dad is dressed in clean and presentable clothing each day, he's got adequate food in his cupboards and fridge, and that he eats enough of it. Each of us visits Dad once a day, brother in the morning, sister at lunchtime, myself in the early evening. And whilst strictly speaking that means that Dad isn't isolated from the virus, we've been urged to continue in this fashion by both the Carers Society, and the staff at the Memory Clinic at Furness General Hospital who are monitoring Dad's health. They are fully aware that left alone and isolated, Dad wouldn't have a chance of coping through these times, not a chance in hell. And as for looking to put him into a Care Home to be looked after... I've already pointed out the shortcomings. Not on your life, his life, or my life. Not yet a while anyway. Though we all know that eventually Dad will need to be getting the specialist care his illness will warrant, Alzheimer's doesn't let anybody off the hook, there is no cure. But we're not there yet, so we keep going in our daily support, virus or no virus. Technology. Each Sunday D and I take part in a friendly quiz that has been set up by our eldest daughter and her husband, about seven or eight individuals or pairs are usually involved, and it is done via Facebook I think. The wife sits there on her sofa and her phone screen splits into about eight squares so that we can all see each other, which I think is pretty cool though I have no idea as to how its achieved. Other than that, we've subscribed to Netflix in order to have access to some good movies and documentaries to watch during the evenings. The only DIY project we've got involved with is our bedroom. Before we went on holiday to Portugal in March, we ordered a new bed from Bensons for Beds. It will be easier for me to do a straight forward copy and paste job from my daily diary to explain how it went. Wednesday 26th February. D and I have decided that we need a new bed and mattress as our current bed is practically falling apart. The frame of the bed upon which the mattress sits is made up of wooden slats held in place by plastic sockets, a cheap and cheerful affair. But over half of these plastic sockets have broken away, cracked and useless, leaving the wooden slats to move about and even drop away from the bed frame and land upon the floor beneath. So I put it to D that we should invest in a new bed, a decent bed that would likely last us our lifetime even if the mattress didn't, and she heartily agreed. We set off to see what beds are on the market in the towns furniture shops, and D was especially keen to visit a place called Bensons for Beds. Upon entering this building I was hit by the heat within the place, it was overly hot. D informed me that the manager of this place was a chap called J Recognise him I did, and I can confirm that he is indeed a nice bloke. “Hello P, Hello D my love.. and what can I do for you?” And we were off again... “Ooh now this divan.... Ooh look at this headboard over here..” J explained the different types of mattresses available, the differing styles of bed frame, two drawer divans, four drawer divans, and a full frontal lift up divan giving maximum storage space, and informed us that we can pick and choose any combination we liked, and he'd see to it that our requirements would be met. In short, he taught us both a lot about the quality of mattresses and the differing types of beds available. We laid upon beds to test mattresses for comfort, we pulled at drawers, lifted frames, laid down some more and I damn near nodded off, though I did arch an eyebrow when D and J flirtatiously discussed which drawer would be best suited for keeping whips, chains and sex toys in. Once we'd made up our minds, about the bed rather than the sex toy drawer, J got to work making note of which bed, which mattress, and which headboard, and of what colour were to be put together for us. He then tapped at his little hand held I-pad doodah, and then took off a hundred pounds from the total due to him being a regular drinker and D doing such a fine job of serving him his beer, like she does. £1.880 for the best bed that I'm likely to buy between now and the end of my natch. Though in a last flourish he told us that the bed that we chose was more than likely going to be discounted to the tune of a hundred pounds, possibly more, by next Wednesday. So if we keep our powder dry for another week, he'll let D know if and when the price drops, and he'll arrange for the bed to be delivered after we return from our trip to Portugal. “Keep your money in your pocket for now, come and speak to me next week, there's every chance I can save you both a few quid more.” A top lad is J, proper nice guy. Sunday 1st March. Bensons the bed people had been in touch with D at some point yesterday, and D contacted J to see what was occurring. Bottom line was that if we ordered the bed this weekend, and left a deposit of 20% before close of play today, we could have the bed for £1,700 giving us an extra saving of £180 on top of the £100 that J knocked off the price last week. I went down to the shop this afternoon and did the deal with J himself, and I also paid an extra £20 to have the guys delivering the bed assembling the headboard and everything else too. If I'm spending that kind of money on a bed, I want nothing at all to do with assembling the bloody thing. The most immediate thing to worry about was getting the bedroom decorated, D chose a colour scheme and it was off to B&Q to buy a large tin of “Luxurious Lilac” vinyl emulsion for the walls, and “Brilliant White” for the ceiling. I cannot recall the exact timeline of events without trawling through my diary, but its fair to say that our trip abroad, the onset of the virus, and the close down of British industry all meant that the bed was put on hold. So the pressure was off with regards the painting of the room, which suited me fine as it allowed me to prevaricate at my leisure. Thursday 14th May. D has had another message from Bensons the bed people, our new bed is being delivered on Monday, sometime between 07.00 and 13.00 hrs. which means of course that I need to get my finger out and finish off painting the bedroom, tomorrow, I promise. Saturday at the latest because I refuse to work on my birthday. Scouts honour, I'll get it done. Friday 15th May. I've practically finished the bedroom job, just a bit of touching up to do around the window frame. D gave me a hand by taking a brush and cutting in around the skirting boards and the radiator. Between us we had it done in an hour or so. Tomorrow we're taking our current bed out of our room and setting it up in L's old room, the idea being that come Monday morning when our new bed is delivered, our bedroom will be completely empty and the floor and skirting boards will have been thoroughly cleaned and washed down. Now that the walls are just about finished, and the new bed is imminent, D has turned her eyes to a new pair of bedside tables for the room, she ordered a pair this afternoon over the telephone. Each being three drawers high with a mirrored finish and costing £80 apiece. I've also been put on notice that she's looking for a new light fitting for the room, not that there's anything wrong with the existing one, other than its not brand new with sparkly bits on it. She showed me pictures of the sort of thing she's looking for, and to be honest it looks like something that would be a feature piece in a nightclub. This masterpiece hangs from the ceiling on chrome chains that are four foot long, and I had to point out to her that although it looks a spectacular piece of kit, our ceiling is only eight feet high, meaning the actual light would hover but two feet or less from the top of the mattress. As this dawned upon her to the extent that she realised I was quite correct, and that she hadn't quite thought it through properly, I detected a degree of irritation. Almost as if to suggest I was being fussy about the subject of not wanting to burn my arse each time the light was switched on, or perhaps be blinded by the bloody thing. She's not for giving in though, she'll buy a light fitting before the weekend is out for sure. Oh, and by the way, we need a new set of bedsheets and a quilt cover, the colour silver was mentioned, and then the small matter of new curtains needs to be dealt with. As if spending £1,700 on the bed wasn't enough to induce nightmares alone. Monday 18th May. I'm up with the larks to await our new bed being delivered. According to the message D received yesterday, the bed is to be delivered between the hours of 7.00 and 13.00 but who the hell knocks on your door at 7.00 in the morning with a double bed and mattress in their wagon? We completely gutted everything out of our bedroom to give these lads the space to manoeuvre themselves and get the thing assembled. Our existing bed is now in L's old bedroom where it will now stay. Yesterday saw me finish off the painting job in our bedroom, just little touch up odds and ends really but now its complete, in my eyes at least, though D maintains the right to find faults as and when she pleases. That's how it works of course, after all, where would we be without fault finding wives tapping their fingers on some surface or other and telling us; “You've missed a bit”? Tuesday 19th May. The bed arrived at 11.05 yesterday morning, delivered in a large panel truck by two men with Lancashire – Manchester accents who did not want to hang around. I had paid Bensons an extra £20 in real cash to assemble the thing for me, but that simply wasn't going to happen. I answered a call on D's phone not five minutes before they arrived telling me exactly that. “Now then fella, one thing I do have to tell you is that due to this Covid-19 virus, yeah, we won't be able to assemble the bed for you OK? We will however put it into the bedroom for you and explain to you how it all works, and I'm talking about four bolts to fasten the headboard, and three bolts to fasten the divan together, it really is that simple. The company will reimburse you the money that we know that you paid for us to do it like, but as things are, we're not to spend anymore time in other folks houses than is strictly necessary. Is that OK?” “It'll have to be, won't it? If your not going to do it, then your not going to do it, so I suppose OK is all I can say to that. When will you be here?” “About five or ten minutes from now I reckon, see you shortly.” The pair of them must have been sat at the end of the street to make that call, for they were outside my door within the minute. Gloved up, masked up, and frankly speaking looking terrified of me. When they arrived for work that morning and took a look at the delivery address, noticing the town Barrow-in-Furness on the ticket, they probably panicked. What I haven't made mention of in my journal yet is the fact that Barrow-in-Furness is all over the news media, television, print, and radio, as the country's hottest hotspot for the virus. Not just above the nations average either, we're talking three times more confirmed cases per 100,000 people than anywhere else in the country, including the poorest areas of London where folk were dropping like flies barely a month back. Barrow-in-Furness is currently Covid central right now, and that's the last thing the town needs to be plastered all over the television screens. There are of course a couple or more theories as to why and how this has occurred, but these two guys on my doorstep weren't here to listen to that nonsense. They wanted to offload the bed and set off back to the M6 as fast as their truck would carry them, “So please step aside sir and tell me where you want it.” Suffice it to say, that it took D and I two and a half hours to properly assemble the bed. The first thirty minutes or so was simply unpacking the thing, for it was wrapped up in more polythene and cardboard than I could believe. Once we had it all unwrapped the stuff filled the spare room we use as a wardrobe, and the landing as well. And whilst the instructions were straight forward to understand, they were anything other than easy to execute, though between us we got there in the end. About two-thirds of the way through this battle, just as we we're beginning to see the end in sight, there was a knock at our door. And stood before me was an Asian lad, thirty something, wrestling a pair of boxes from the rear of his van. “These are our new bedside tables being delivered, just in time too.” Says D, as gaily as if it were a picnic hamper being brought to the door. I left them at the bottom of the stairs for the time being, preferring to have the bed finished before we started to add to the debris littering the upstairs floorspace. Soon enough the bed was assembled and in position, D was stuffing polythene sheeting, and bits of cardboard and plastic inside the polythene cover that had held the mattress. I carried each of these new boxes upstairs to open them up and see what was inside. I was thankful that these bedside tables"

Married, from Kendal Cumbria. Retired Part 3. UK Events I have been appalled at how many people are not having the vaccine and their reasons for not doing so. Of those who have discussed it with me they are unanimous in their belief they will not catch the virus andeven if they do it will be no different than having flue. Some think it is a conspiracyby the government to cover up afailing economy. None have thought about what effect their behaviour might have on their fellow man if they are a carrier for the disease and infecting all they come into contact with. Those that have had the vaccine have become complacentabout mask wearing and sterilising/ washing hands. This in turn is leading to more infections, shortages of staff and goods which affects us all. On the plus side. Many who have worked fromhome arebeing allowed to continueand maybe just work 2/3 days in the office. This is certainly a bonusto one parent families. Thenewnorm. has helped me agreat deal.Iamnowableto attend lecturesviazoomasthough in a classroom environment without the expenseof traveling to attend. I am very concerned about the rising energy costs. As I have recently moved into a new house I changed my energy supplier as I thought the previous one may go bust. I am on a variable tariff and although I have sent in three-meter readings for electricity and gas I am only shown my electricity usage. I am assured by the company they have switched my gas from the old company to the new but I stillhave no ideahow much I am using. This worries me.The whole of my street (all brand new houses) is experiencing the same and many are with different suppliers. My electricity usagesofar has been very low but willbe increasing asthe dark nights extend into winter. I pay a set amount each month of £88.83 for the next 12 months and have accrued quite a bit in the three months I have been here but I fear it will not be enough as the increase price for gas started on12thNovember. As a pensioner I do get a bonus of £100 winter fuel allowance in December which will be a help. My heart goes out to the family of the murdered PM Sir David Amess as he conducted his constituency surgery on Friday 15thOctober 2021 in Leigh on sea,Essex. MP’s state they all receive a great deal of abuse and hate mail but are now in fear of theirlives as well. MP’s don’t want a wedge placed between themselves and their constituent. Ali HarbiAli stabbed his victim and is accused of murder and terrorist acts. He has yet to be convicted of the crime but there is substantial evidence and the murder weapon. I wonder in these cases if the person is sane. Crimes of this nature is on the increase with a great number of teenagers being stabbed for seemingly no reason other than they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Is it because of the increase of alcohol and drugs in society today. There is such a lotof hatein peopleshearts these days. Why? Is it the start of the breakdown of society. Will we all be fearful for our lives and become reclusive in the future? I hope I don’t live long enough to see that happen."

Thinking about it I can’t really say that I think 2021 has been eventful, it just feels a continuation of the last awful year. Covid 19 is still an ongoing unwelcome event, and once again seems to be sweeping across the UK and Europe especially. We couldn’t wait to get our booster jab and that truly has been an event to look forward to. As with all of the other Covid related jabs it has been problem and worry free and no real side effects. There are still plenty of people wearing masks but slightly more choosing not to. I noticed on a recent bus trip that all the elderly passengers wore masks or shields but anyone under thirty were not. I found this irritating. The recent gas price increases are concerning and our energy firm Avro was one of the casualties and we have been allocated Octopus Energy but the transfer appears to be trouble free. We are moving house so hopefully our next house will be more energy efficient than our present one. Our daughter is very poorly at the moment so I am afraid that is far more worrying than price rises. We will manage we normally do. The killing of the Southend MP Sir David Amess was truly shocking. I used to live in Southend so it is dear to my heart. It was just so violent and senseless. I have to say I despair at the continuing violence that simmers under the surface of so many people. It beggar’s belief that someone can even do that to any other human being or is allowed to do it in the sense of lack of security. And when you find out that some of these perpetrators are known risks it is even more upsetting. Today in the papers a young couple have been stabbed to death seemingly over a parking dispute. Now Prince Andrew. What do I think? I don’t really know. He has certainly made some bad choices in terms of his social contacts. Whether or not he met up and had sex with the girl in question I have no idea. As with most rape or sexual abuse cases it is ‘he said ‘she said’. Apparently in some states in America the age of 17 is classed as a child, but in others I believe you can be married at 15. If she believes this alleged assault to be true then I hope she gets justice. His TV interview where he denied all knowledge was very ill thought through and a bit of a car crash. No doubt he will be protected by the family and has plenty enough money to see his way out of this. He certainly will not be the only male to be offered girls to order. If a woman is mature enough to make her own informed decisions that is one thing, but quite another for a young woman to be coerced or groomed into activities that she really doesn’t want to be part of. Sex trafficking is an evil and repugnant trade and no self-respecting individual should have anything to do with it. It goes on of course as money talks. I was speaking to a male friend (early 70’s) yesterday and his take on it was that the girl was probably star struck and wanted to meet up with a royal and then didn’t like it. That is an opinion but, in my mind, could be victim blaming. I actually don’t think that Prince Andrew should go to America and be tried, purely because America puts plenty of barriers in the way to protect their own citizens from prosecution in other countries. They were certainly not helpful when the British teenager near the American airbase was killed by an American officer’s wife driving on the wrong side of the road. She was whisked straight out of the country before she had to face the music. Most people that I have talked to about Prince Andrew thinks that he isn’t very bright and should stay completely out of the way. I certainly don’t think that he is an asset to any of us, more of an embarrassment. When HRH Prince Philip passed away earlier in the year, that was a very sad event. He had been out of the public eye for some while but his presence was still felt. The Queen appeared very bereft and lonely at his funeral. It seemed eventful that Her Majesty the Queen has been unable to attend some of her duties. Because she is so driven in her role as Monarch it certainly feels a newsworthy event if she is unwell."

Have you, or others you know, been effected by the virus? Have you been ill? . Are you doing anything to protect yourself or others from the coronavirus? Have you self-isolated? Have you changed your behaviour? . Have your shopping habits changed? Have you noticed any changes in the availability of food or other goods in the shops? . What do you think about the UK government’s response to the pandemic? We welcome thoughts about any other countries response to Covid-19. Where do you get your news about the virus? Have you noticed any jokes, memes or sources poking fun at the virus? I am writing this between 30th March and 6th April and I plan to provide another observation or two as the Government have announced over the last day or so that it could be approximately six months before ‘normal’ life can resume. Over this period I daresay that I will have a lot more thoughts on the subject and indeed, many more questions that are nobody will be likely to have answer as we have little experience of living in the midst of a pandemic. At the current time, my wife (66) and I (73) are in self-isolation in accordance with Government advice and have been for about 10 days. To date we have found plenty to do but now that the house has been cleaned right through (apart from two rooms more of which later) so it is now a case of trying to keep our selves active physically and mentally. Fortunately we have not succumbed to the illness and I do not think there have been any cases in this commuter town some 35 miles from London and a population of about 130,000. Self-isolation is our main method of protecting ourselves but we have been taking other measures related to social distancing too. It has not been necessary for us to go out to shops or pharmacies for three reasons. The first is that two of our ‘children’ (thirty year olds) both live in the town and being less vulnerable have taken on the task of getting food and medicines to us, Secondly, shopping has been further supported by the initiative ofone neighbour who has set up a ‘whatsapp’ group wherebythose not self-isolation can help those who are. Thirdly, initially, we were taking a walk each afternoon for exercise but this involved a lot of effort in crossing roads etc., to social distance from others on with the same idea. I swam every Saturday but this is no longer possible. As a result of this exercise had been confined to the garden when the weather has been kind and walking on the treadmill that we have in the house. Whilst I did not rush out and stockpile, I have had the foresight, luck or just being frugal and practical by taking steps over the past nine months to take advantage of supermarket offers and the like to buy extra store cupboard goods to build up a reserve. This was something I did primarily due to our imminent departure from the European Union (disclosure – I am a Remainer) when there was advice from various Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services sources to do so. Thus I was able to avoid the rather selfish but understandable melee for a pack of toilet rolls despite there being an excellent supply chain to the supermarkets. My family remains well at this time. My eldest son is working from home and his wife will be when the technology has arrived but in the meantime as she has underlying health issues has been instructed to self-isolate for 12 weeks. My youngest son is self-employed and works from home all the time so no change there. My daughter and her partner both work for colleges that have closed and both are working from home. My daughter is the most nervous of the family, she has a tendency to catastrophise and has been very upset on occasions especially when she has watched the news too much. She is now becoming more relaxed. We are all in contact with each other using the phone, Factime or Skype and on Sunday (5th) Skype families call was arranged and we spent 90 minutes talking, laughing and enjoying the chat. I have to say the without myyoungersonandmydaughter’spartnergettingregularfoodsuppliesforus,ourlifewouldhavechanged considerably. My eldest son lives in the West Country so clearly not able to halp with this. My closest friend returned from Australia on 21st March where he and his wife had had been visiting family for 3 months and in his words ‘walked into a war zone’ ! They too are seklf isolating but do go out foe shopping and walks. I have another friend who is Belgian and lives Tienen, about 35 miles from Brussels.. We worked tgether on a Business Recovery project but I do not think that pandemics were on the radar at that time but there have been email exchanges where we both go over what we though might have been done but of little use now that we are both ‘retired’. His wife has had Covid-19 and recovered without too much fuss so I am able to get another view of how it is affecting us all. Getting food, as already mentioned, has relied upon two members of the family. Initially, it was difficult as shelves were bare due to stock-piling. As the supermarkets have now instigated better policies, restricting numbers admitted, marked queuing and restricting items per person, it has become easier from them and supplies are coming a lot easier. After the initial panic, it seems that the usual British queuing habits have resurfaced! Exercise has been a bit of an issue. My wife and I both have arthritis and are in chronic pain. Prior to Covid, I was swimming 1k once a week and walking regularly whilst my wife is not a big exercise fan but will walk when I shame her into it. Walking in the neighbourhood was our original plan but to be honest it was a bit of a nightmare because one had to keep crossing over etc to keep the social distance so we ruled this out. We have a treadmill and are using this but not as regularly as I would like as we have both had ‘flares’ perhaps caused by the stress of our situation. It can also be difficult to remain motivated as self-isolating over a long period taxes ones mental health. I keep saying to myself that at least we are not involved in a violent conflict where we are being bombed or enduring strict rationing but this is lif changing. One area of good news is that the environment has benefitted and there indications that air pollution has reduced. Certainly, our surroundings have been quieter, no cars on the road, no children playing in the street (sadly missed) and one can now hear birdsong clearly. As Spring has approached personally, the change is more noticeable perhaps as I have time to look around our small garden and actually notice what is happening rather than rushing about and only giving a fleeting glance. A spell of good weather has been welcome after grey skies and that lifts one but I am hoping we can avoid a heatwave like last year as this could increase our problems with food supplies and demand for electricity (fans) and water. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services I do worry on a number of fronts. I do not want to catch the virus as I feel somewhat pessimistic about my chances of survival but over the past 18 months I have been a ‘wise virgin’ in making sure that a will is in place and that there are various documents outlining my wishes should death approach and all my affairs are well documented. A bit of a bleak outlook I agree as I want to spend much more time with the family. I worry about the family as I want them to remain healthy and get concerned over the guys who do our shopping that they may be exposing themselves to the virus. I take heart that they are both early 30s so should be OK. I worry too about my wife’s lack of motivation to exercise, her willingness to focus on lightweight TV programmes and lack of desire to make better use of her term – or is that just me who reads, uses MOOCs and other things. Who knows which of us has the right idea? I know that I have a number of films lined up on Netflix that I am finding hard to resist! That’s all for the moment but I will return to the subject as things change. In the meantime, I have a lot of questions that have thought about but to which there rae no answers presently but that me resolve themselves late. Joke I went into a supermarket earlier this week and while in there I coughed. Four shoppers turned around immediately and for a moment I thought I was on the Voice!! My questions without answers. . How did this all start? Was it due to eating bats and Pangolins from wet markets in China? Is it a conspiracy by China to develop and release the virus to undermine world economies and cement their role as the leader of the world as suggested by some? . Is this all an act of God? Is this the beginning of a total collapse? . Is this the result of climate change and our dereliction of duty to Earth? . Will we/can we make a better world when this is all over? . Will human attitudes towards each other improve? . Can the community spirit engendered by the virus be sustained when it has gone? . Whilst I do not understand why Italy and Spain have suffered so much, the USA situation is blindingly obvious. Those who have vast wealth will by any means, political, economic etc., will use the virus as a means of oppressing the poor and creating more wealth for themselves. .

Is there a correlation between air pollution and Covid-19? Apparently smokers are likely to be more impacted by the virus and where there are high volumes of air pollution thereby creating smoker like lungs in the population, accordingly they face the same problem. . Where is the point, where life will return to normal and what will be the new normal? .

Over the past week we have been told that the lock-down will continue for at least another three weeks although I think it will be a lot longer. I am not sure that I agree with one of the scientific advisors who is suggesting that social distancing could continue until the end of the year but my thinking is based upon zero new cases being seen. While one appreciates the need to get the economy kick-started, all options are really on the table at present. On a personal basis, the lock-down has been fairly relaxed although the same cannot be said for my wife. Before the lock-down, I worked a lot from home with some volunteer work to provide interaction apart from friends and book club, etc. As such I was quite used to being around the house. I read a lot and have been able to get plants for the garden and with the weather being good there has been a fair amount to do. My wife retired just before the lock-down and worked behind the till at our local Tesco. She has had to get used to this phase of her life and the lock-down at the same time as well as losing the interaction with customers, friends, and family. Added to which she and our daughter love shopping so for her this has been a very frustrating time. As my daughter moved out in February there is also the empty nester syndrome to deal with so we have cleaned the house from top to bottom and, as mentioned, knocked the garden back into shape and now have the loft to sort out and decide things like 'do we need all these mugs'! Getting shopping has been an interestingissue. Myyoungest sonandmydaughter’spartnerhave been absolute saviours in keeping us well stocked. I have been playing the new game in town, getting a shopping slot from one of the major supermarkets, a need as neither of us are on the Government ‘s vulnerable list and therefore not giving a priority slot despite my being 73 and ‘strongly advised to stay at home, a bit of a conundrum! Since myfirst note, I was able to secure one of the precious slots and a good amount of goods was obtained. I continue to join the casino for another at reasonable intervals. Along with good weather has been the lower level of noise and I found this from an art project conducted by Bernadette Meyer in 1971, a photographer and artist who began experimenting with her memory. She shot a roll of 35mm film each day and kept a rigorous daily journal. The project resulted in a staggering total of 1,100 photographs and nearly six hours of recorded poetry. On silence she wrote: What happens outside the window, the noises we hear from other apartments, the photographs we find on our corkboard or in our phones, the meals we're cooking, the shows we're watching, the words we read online or in books—these are all part of life and demonstrate how larger structures of gender, politics, and economics affect even these small moments. They make up our memories too if we pay attention. I liked it a lot and feel it offers something related to these times. One outcome from the extended lock-down has been the amount of media noise about when the restrictions will be lifted and what shape will the 'new normality' looks like? As I said earlier I have been relaxed and with some extra thing time, the return to 'normal' life has been in my thoughts. I also alluded to this in my previous Covi-19 note. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services In a previous lifetime, I was involved in looking at business continuity for the company and there was and is always the thought that the firm would emerge from whatever had created the initial problem albeit in a new building possibly. Although there was the possibility of the firm closing completely, it was not at the forefront of our minds perhaps because we did foresee pandemics as a possible cause of business continuity loss. In the case of Covid, options appear to be more numerous One thought is that where Governments have been handing out cash to the NHS and help those families and companies that are being damaged badly, there will be some payback necessary post-Covid and we will see higher taxation put in place. Air pollution has been markedly reduced as a result of less traffic on the roads and air travel. Will this affect a more positive response to climate change? In China, following the financial fallout in 2008, they saw a decrease in air pollution but this had returned pre-2008 standards the following year as recovery packages were put in place. So I am not hopeful of a major shift in the policy being seen in the UK. Working from home has, for many firms and individuals been a new experience, and one that many companies may well consider this as a more normal option when we are over the virus. There are clear cost benefits in terms of the need for smaller offices, 'hot-desking’ as and when employees do need to show their faces. As levels of commuting fall, firms based in London could look at dropping what is called 'London Weighting' where salaries in the City are slightly higher than for the same work in the provinces as City workers have higher commuting costs. If an individual is working from home, the drop in London weighting is compensated by the elimination of fares. If this transition takes place, more office space could be available and there may be interest in renovating offices as residential flats assuming this was viable. This could be sold to councils who would then provide social housing, the demand for which is very high in the UK. Many people are working on a vaccine to counter Covid-19 but this is still some way away and sinceourGP starts‘flu jabs’inSeptember,ifthere isa repeatofCovid-19 or heaven forbid a Covid -20, we are going to be in an unimaginable situation. Yet some people do not seem to overly concerned are Texas 'anti-vaxxers ‘and this storyleavesmeshaking myhead. https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/texas-anti-vaxxers-fear-mandatory-coronavirus-vaccines/ I am concerned that the need to control the sweep of the virus will see an emergence of even more right-wing controls being put in place that will no doubt be designed to increase the wealth of the 1%ters, i.e., that 1% of the world that has something above 90% of the wealth of the world, by privatization, reduction of public spending, and health and welfare benefits. In the US there are indications of this already in place and the following is an interesting piece from a professor of politics dated 12th April. https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/ This paper from Foundational Economy Collective provides some cogent arguments for a better world in the future but for the time being everything is conjecture. https://foundationaleconomycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/what-comes-after-the-pandemic­fe-manifesto-005.pdf Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Newspaper headlines this morning (25th) are talking up businesses being prompted to open, Premier League football returning behind closed doors, and a form of 'clustering' in our homes with ten of our family members and friends. I have a long-held mistrust of mainstream media and this is just rubbish to fill a paper. Sadly, some people do believe it but in truth we do not know when there will be relief from the tunnel so wait and see. I will produce the third note in a couple of weeks with further thoughts. MO Number:  N6622  Marital Status:  Married  Sex:  Male  Location:  Wickford, Essex  Age:  73  Occupation:  Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services  Covid-19 Notes – Part 3 Well, it is 25th July 2020 a bit more than the few weeks since Part 2 but we are now to all intents and purpose, we are completely out of lockdown in England after some 125 days and we are returning to nearly the normal that was in place before lockdown. Of course, it isnot normal nor is the ‘new normal’ that has been thrown around by all and sundry. If life was normal would so many of us feel apprehensive about venturing into shops or still maintaining the original instruction of keeping a social distance of 2 metres? We are also to wear a mask or other face-covering each time we enter a shop under the legal threat of a fine of £100 for not doing so. However, since neither the shop staff nor the police feels that they cannot enforce the law so what is the point of it? It is also apparent that the Government have now reached a point whereby the economy is more important than the health of its citizens and any suggestions from the scientific advisors are determined to be not necessary at the moment or ignored totally. Those of working age, who have been working from home, are now urged to return to their place of work ignoring the fact that most employers do not have the funds or ability to put in place the required health and safety requirements that might prevent a second wave. Then, of course, many firms have discovered that via technology such as Zoom and Teams. Their employees can even more effectively at home and the employer can reduce the cost of his overheads by them doing so. The reason why Government is urging employees back to work is that they do not want to see a fall in office property prices as they remain empty and unwanted nor do they want a drop in income from lack of customers using public transport – another area where there are health and safety concerns. Also, there have been several well-known companies either going into liquidation or administration and there will be a great many more doing this if the workforce is not in place to shop in their lunch hour or after work spending their salaries. For those, who cannot work from home, the furlough scheme will end in October, and many employees will find that the business has insufficient funding to pay them or they will have gone under. Whatever reason, there will be many losing their job and unemployment will soar. So much for a growing economy! Parents are also being urged to send their children back to school at the end of August, primarily because Government wants parents to get back to work which they cannot at present whilst caring for their children and home-schooling. I suspect that many parents are still uncomfortable about this and would prefer to see evidence of schools having a good health guarding environment in place before sending their children back. I am not sure schools will be able to manage this. My daughter is a SEN teacher and although there will be indicators in place to show the social distance etc., any further PPE she needs, she has to purchase herself – not a good sign. Will all children be back in school – I doubt it any attempt to penalise them will not be a good vote catcher! Locally, there is little evidence of my neighbourhood opening up. We have a mix of young families and older people and the latter are happy to take exercise in the local parks and young children are out on their bikes or kicking a football around, leisure retail or window shopping as it was once known is not high on the agenda. Many of us, including myself, have made use of online shopping to get food, garden plants, decorative material etc., and feel no need to venture further. I even had an online discussion with our GP over a small health matter and a prescription was sent electronically to my designated pharmacy and a quick Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services visit, with a maskin place, rendering the whole exercise very quickly andeasily achieved, somewhat different to the old normal! I have been swimming regularly for over 25 years as my main exercise and with indoor pools re-opening today, I was interested to see the guidance from the swimming association on how pools should address health and safety. Two points stood out for me, the first that as much outside air should be admitted to the pool area and the second was that changing rooms should be minimised. On the first point, this is not possible in my pool where it is enclosed on all sides and I do not understand the second guidance statement. Are we to queue for one single cubicle? I do think that none of this matters as this virus is here to stay until there is a vaccine in place – still perhaps a year away -and this will mean that a second wave is likely and lockdowns, either nationally or locally will beinplace. Inthemeantime,therewill bereviewsoftheGovernment’sperformance,thatI suspectwill not be glowing – there are many who feel that lockdown started too late. A final comment and one fact that I, a left-wing remainer liked, was that on the day that we left the European Union, the 31st of January 2020, was the date that there was confirmation of the first patient being confirmed with Covid-19. Karma perhaps?"

I did these things weekly but I also visited friends and family, museums, gardens, exhibitions too so I was out a lot. I wondered what I would do with all the time indoors. I got up later to make the day shorter. I didn’t worry if a good book kept me up later at night. I began a short inline course, which I completed sooner than expected, and practiced playing keyboard more than usual. I also spend more time doing family history than usual. I put in more plants than usual as I would have more time to water/care for them. This is the only year I ever got the dead-heading done properly. I have spend less time seeing family and friends and more time communicating via technology.I have spend more time in my local environment, my house and garden as I was, and still am, shielding. I was always very attuned to natural rhythms but found that nature has got used to me. The birds still stay in the garden while I am there. There has been a squirrel and 2 fox cubs who have broken the 2 metre rule and the other 2 fox cubs were not far off. They are used to me now but they know they are not supposed to be here. (They live next door). My rhythm/routine will not be able to change until there is a Covid vaccine, unless you count when the weather gets colder and then I will spend more time indoors. I don’t really make distinctions between different times of the day but my husband works by meal times. I would rather eat when I am hungry and not because it is a certain time. I do have to take my medication roughly 12 hours apart so usually morning and evening. I try to do exercise before meals because its more uncomfortable to do it after. We are both retired so one person’s time is not more important than someone elses unless its to do with tablet/pill taking time or when I had an appointment for my blood test, which he drove me to. Mostly our time is in synch but sometimes we want to watch different tv programmes at the same time and have to compromise. I don’t really see any changes until we get a vaccine. We have had to use technology we would rather not. We had to set up Duo on his phone to be able to see family and I set up Zoom to join I (watch) a mother and baby class for our new granddaughter. I refused to join the microsoft teams meetings my local club has started because I just ran out of microsoft and am not going to pay again. Then I found out my friends are not using it either so it would all be people I don’t know and frankly I’ve got better things to do. We’ve had to do online shopping. It was rubbish to start with until they got priority slots and suddenly all the supermarkets wanted to deliver to us. When we did get slots they would deliver but say there was no bread or no milk. It still takes longer to order online than when we used to go to the shop and you know if you will get what you ordered. Sometimes they send substitutes but its often something you don’t want. I have used diaries, calendars etc but only in the way I did before Covid. However there have been more entries for dates when things are to be delivered because we have to get it all online. One thing we have to do now though is remember when stuff was delivered. We only open it 3 days later once the Covid germs are supposed to be gone. Most things go into a bag using a gloved hand to await their 3 day deadline. If its perishable it either goes into a bag and into the freezer for 3 days or its washed and treated with antibac. But its less work to wait for the 3 days if possible. Once we’ve had the vaccine we won’t do this. There is one change I will make permanent. Before Covid I used to withdraw cash to pay my rent and council tax at the post office. Since covid I have been paying these by phone with the Tesco credit card. When the credit card bill comes I have paid it by phone, for the whole month, from my building society account. This means that 1) I do not have to go out if the weather is bad 2) I am not carrying cash so can’t be mugged 3) I get vouchers to spend at Tesco just for paying my bills. This time we got £19 in Tesco vouchers. I can’t believe I missed this trick for the last 20 years or so. Yes I do feel like life has been put on hold. I would like to cuddle with my grandchildren and my daughter. I would like to visit my mum who I have only spoken to on the phone since 18th March. We would like to book a holiday because we had to cancel our September one. I would like to be able to swim and dance again. I would like to visit places of interest or even the local park and not have to worry that someone there might give me Covid which could kill me. I would like to have my granddaughter to sleep over – and even take her shopping like I used to. I would like to go and buy 3 birthday presents that I owe to friends who I have not seen since lockdown. I would like to take my friend and my neighbour out for a meal to say thanks for helping us when we needed it. But I can’t do any of these things until I have either had the vaccine or decided I don’t care whether Covid kills me and/or my husband. So yes you could say I’m waiting.My experience of waiting is mainly as above but we have also waited for food deliveries which say they will be between 10am and 6pm. It means that you are not sure whether you should cook a meal because you need to attend to the delivery ASAP because frozen good will thaw and it can be stolen from the doorstep like my husband’s medication delivery was.We have never queued outside a shop. We have not been to any shops. They did send me to hospital for a blood test. It was scary. They would not let me wear gloves but they all wore them. They were protecting themselves more than me. In the end I made sure to touch nothing. When I needed to open doors I put my hand inside a plastic bag which I happened to have in my pocket. They made me sit on 4 different chairs while I was there. If I had been fitter I would have stood. I put everything I was wearing in the wash as soon as I got home and got in the shower. Also there were lines on the floor where you had to stand. They were 2 meters apart and I would have liked them to be a lot further away. They have now discovered that the germs float about in the air and cover a greater distance but they are keeping quiet about it for economic reasons. As it was I left 2 gaps between me and the next person and also faced away from them. I have to have bloods done every 3 months so I am not looking forward to going again.* I have been ill and spoken to my gp by phone. They were able to send me antibiotics. They also wanted me to give a urine sample but I refused to go to collect the form/tube. When they asked how they were supposed to work like that I suggested they post it and to my surprise they did. I still have not given them the sample though because I am not sure how to get it back to them. I will wait till I’m more desperate than now. *When I was at the hospital they could tell I was worried. One of the staff told me that hospitals are clean places. As if. I told him that a hospital gave my Dad MRSA and C. difficile and he only went in for a bad knee. Hospitals are NOT clean. Thats why so many hospital staff caught Covid 19."

Am I missing something? Is everyone engaged in mass testing and I am an outlier? Am I failing in my COVID duty?! (kidding...) I have lots of thoughts on the topic, of course, but I was suprised to see so much attention placed on this topic. So first off, I have not yet had a single COVID test. Confession done... There are many reasons for this - first I have been working form home since March 2020, and so I have not needed to have one done to enter the workplace. A friend of mine has had to do this, but we are very suspicious of the legality/privacy implications of what her employers is doing with her personal health data. Secondly, I know the government tried to encourage us all to have a test twice a week, but that seemed like overkill for me as I am working at home, and often dont see anyone in between the twice a week when the government wants us to tests so it seems like a waste of time. Thirdly, I haven't had to have any medical procedures since COVID started. nor have I wanted to go overseas so I havent had one for that. The two most important reasons I havent had a COVID test though are - that I remain unconvinced of their efficacy anyway - there is so much in the news about false positives and the % that dont work, - also how to game the test with orange juice - so that is why I though people weren't bothering to test. Kind of like how everyone is turning off contact tracing on the test & trace app - I felt like I didnt know what the point of testing is. The other key reason I havent had a test is the discomfort of the test itself. the idea of shoving something up my nose that far, and then the back of my throat horrifies me/makes me freak out, so that is another reason I have avoided them. I do find it unbelievable that they have not yet come up with an easier test/less invasive test. If they did then I feel more people would be on board with them. As it is though, I will be avoiding them until I absolutely have to have one - I have heard too many horror stories from friends! To get back to the directive, I'm also not sure I could administer one for a family member because I think the tests are useless but also because I have heard how my nephew had had to be pinned down to be tested - so cruel and horrible. Who do I think benefitted from the tests? To be honest, I see it as all part of the pandemic hygiene theatre. it makes the government look good, but the use of tests twice a week just seems overkill and potentially damaging to nostrils/nasal cavities, etc. I get that people can be asymptomatic and obviously I am not a medical doctor, but the fact that the lateral flow tests are so rubbish make me lose all faith in their use as a public health measure. If I were being really cynical, I would say that it is whichever Tory mate that got the contract for lateral flow tests who is benefitting otherwise why would the Tories be so into them. It's amazing really that the mask mandate was ever lifted when so many Tories benefited from the contract too. Update - just read a repost about the extortionate cost of the tests & how Treasury keeps VAT on sales - point proven tests are just a massive money spinner for Tories under guise of safety. We do have lateral flow tests in the house as my husband did a couple so he could go and get some books from his office (despite having an office to himself in a block of four with a private entrance. He administered them himself). I also went into a chemist recently to get him another box of tests as he was 'pinged' on the test & trace app. I feel like I have shared considerable detail about my thoughts on Test & Trace - though I recognise that I have not been impacted by it. I feel like the whole system was a massive farce from beginning to end though which is why I label it as pandemic/hygiene theatre, just like how everyone wipes every surface down with disinfectant, when now it is shown that COVID doesnt live long on surface. I think I lost faith in it because it is so half-assed. For example, I dont have a smartphone so couldnt get the app - does this mean I am less likely to get COVID? Similarly, hearing that the lateral flow tests have such poor detection rates, can be gamed by OJ or Ketchup, or even that people testing at home self-report their results - knowing the poor detection rate, why would anyone self-report a positive response, especially if their wages [etc] depended on it (eg people on zero hour contracts). It's really just a typical Tory populist product - designed to cover their asses a something they can spin without actually having any impact - they can use this to blame people for the failure of COVID policies, when really the issues behind variants & UK failure is cack-handed Tory policy that dont recognise structural issues of people's lives. /Rant..."

The death of MP David Amess was tragic but not surprising to me (it speaks volumes about the state of affairs in this country that I immediately guessed that his killer would turn out to be an Islamic extremist.) I’m no supporter of the Conservative Party but, obviously, any murder is abhorrent and I did respect David Amess for his efforts to improve animal rights. I don’t know if he was often photographed with dogs but it seemed that every time his picture was shown in the news following his passing, it was inevitably a shot of him crouched and smiling next to one canine or another. Knowing that the British are a nation of animal lovers, it felt like after his death the media were trying to make him more palatable to the public with those images, as if by saying ‘yes, he was a politician, but he did love dogs!’ Perhaps there was a wariness that people might be indifferent to what had happened to him -as horrifying as it was -because of who he was. I did notice that little mention was made of the fact that just a year before he died he was embroiled in controversy because, despite getting a daily allowance of £25 for his lunch in parliament, he had voted against a motion to allow eligible children to have free school meals during the school holidays – a typically Tory move. I don’t condone the Conservatives for lining their own pockets but at least I understand it – everybody strives to make the most of the opportunities available to them. What really sticks in my craw though is that these MPs make a fortune and then begrudge people in poverty being given the money they need just to survive. The columnist Caitlin Moran nailed the problem – the Conservatives are blithe. I doubt they’d be content with glib phrases like ‘we’ve got to pull our socks up’ or ‘tighten our belts’ if they were faced with any kind of financial difficulties. Their blasé attitude -and their greed -disgusts me and I’m sure a lot of other people feel the same way. To be honest, I was surprised there weren’t violent reprisals against the Conservatives after they implemented the austerity measures a decade ago. (Iain Duncan Smith’s guardian angel must have been working overtime to protect him!) These cuts were unnecessary, brutal, and it seemed like the Tories were gloating about it. I still think that one of the main reasons that so many people in the north of England voted for the Brexit was in retaliation against David Cameron and his cronies for that. It did get rid of them. They didn’t want the Brexit, so we did – and the poor in the provinces had little to lose by taking that gamble with the economic future of Britain. (The politically savvy comedian Jonathan Pie summed up the situation perfectly in his ‘Brexit – What the **** is going on?’ video on Facebook.) Unless you were someone who was struggling to get by at that time – as I was – people had no idea how tough and bleak the Tories had made things for those at the lower end of society. (It’s easier for Remainers now to just retrospectively brand all Brexiteers as ignorant racists.) The country may be experiencing economic turmoil now, due to the combination of Brexit and the pandemic, but I think things might actually have been even worse if David Cameron and co. had been left to carry on plundering the state in such a cavalier fashion -and to provide tax breaks for the rich. The NHS might already have been gone. Boris Johnson, another Conservative worthy of contempt, is currently being investigated for partying with his friends while the rest of us were obeying the lockdown rules. He should resign, but won’t. He knows that if he keeps his unkempt head down long enough, the scandal will blow over. (He must be delighted that the Russia-Ukraine situation is now providing a timely diversion.) Hence, Sue Gray was appointed to look into the matter – but she didn’t take long enough for the public to lose interest, so the Met got involved to launch their own investigation/delay. Sue Gray had started her inquiry from scratch -building evidence, interviewing people, and so forth – and she got the job done in weeks. The Met are using her findings, but how long will they take to reach a conclusion? It’s not a complex murder investigation, it’s only a question of whether some people were at a party or not. I will want to read the full Sue Gray report when it’s published but, apparently, Boris Johnson had to sign off on her findings so I doubt she gave him much scrutiny over his actions and even if he is fined for them then no doubt he’ll try to downplay the seriousness of the matter to save his job. If  disgraced politicians cannot be relied upon to do the honourable thing by resigning then they should be forced out of office. Otherwise, we’ll soon have every MP just stalling until whatever scandal they’re involved in blows over – look at how the Conservatives even tried to protect Owen Paterson after his misconduct. They think it’s one rule for them, and one rule for the rest of us. On that note, I’m not surprised that the lawsuit against Prince Andrew was settled out of court. Very predictable. I’m glad that justice is at least going to be served now that Ghislaine Maxwell has been found guilty of sex trafficking and so will hopefully go to prison for a long time. We know that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked young girls for his own sick pleasure, and that Maxwell assisted him, but I suspect that at least some of their victims were paired off with other people so that they could blackmail them later. It could plausibly have been how they funded their lavish lifestyle. Epstein apparently made millions as a ‘consultant’ for wealthy clients but didn’t seem to do any work to earn it. When Epstein was found dead in his prison cell, in dubious circumstances, people speculated that he had been murdered to prevent him ‘naming names’ yet he’d already served one prison sentence and without causing anyone else to be prosecuted. If Epstein ‘committed suicide’ then I’m of the opinion it was by choosing to blackmail someone who simply wasn’t prepared to put up with it all or who felt they had had been pushed too far and were powerful enough to do something about it. If someone did indeed arrange for Epstein to be killed – and while he was behind bars -then it would have sent a message to Maxwell that she had better not try to blackmail the culprit anymore either. Anyway, I believe Prince Andrew was ‘honey trapped’. If he did have sex with Virginia Guiffre -whether it was forced or consensual – I wouldn’t be surprised if what took place was secretly recorded or photographed by Epstein and Maxwell. (I doubt Virginia Guiffre knew, if that is what happened.) Epstein and Maxwell would have had a hold over Prince Andrew after that. It certainly explains why Prince Andrew would continue to socialise with Epstein, even after he had gone to jail for sexual offences – Andrew wouldn’t have dared refuse if Epstein had insisted on meeting with him. It could be that Andrew just didn’t care about Epstein’s conduct though. The Prince certainly portrayed himself in a bad light during his infamous (and disastrous) Newsnight interview, coming across as arrogant, deceitful and unconcerned about Epstein and Maxwell’s victims. It’ll be interesting to see how things pan out for him. Speaking of the royals, I’m not too happy that Camilla is being lined up to be the next queen. I’m no fan of Princess Diana but I think that the way that Camilla and Charles treated Diana was disgraceful – not befitting members of the royal family -and as such I think that the crown should skip a generation down to William, as he and Kate are showing much more decorum. (The less said about Harry and Meghan, the better.) Camilla appears to perform her duties well but Charles should either have found a way to have married her instead of Diana or abdicated to be with her. I actually don’t know why I ever give the matter so much thought really – there are far more deserving things to think about. On that note, my mother is a firm believer in buying a red poppy every November but I personally have mixed feelings about it. I’m happy to do it for the veterans of WWII at least – that was a war that needed to be fought. However, some of the more recent military action our country has been involved in is harder to justify. It’s not the soldiers’ fault, of course. They go where they are sent. However, when it comes to donating money to good causes, I’d rather give it to a charity for children or animals.

Even if I took my mother – the person for whom I’m a carer – with me, on days out or just to do some shopping, it would still feel like a break from my job. As my mother’s health deteriorated, I was able to go out less and less, with her or on my own. This was a problem because at home there were no clear boundaries as to when my free time was – there couldn’t be, due to the unpredictable nature of my mother’s health condition. As such, my ‘me’ time gradually disappeared. I’d record television programmes but not get around to watching them, I’d buy books and they’d be stacked but not read, and personal projects, like writing responses to the Mass Observation directives, would be delayed. Whenever I did have a moment to myself I was usually too tired to make the most of it. Although I would rather the pandemic hadn’t happened (for obvious reasons) it did turn out to be a blessing in disguise for me. I was getting on with the daily grind and waiting for my mother to finally get the right medication or treatment so that we could go out again which would give me some respite from the wearisome routine my life had become. I’d been waiting and waiting and waiting - for weeks, which became months, which became years. With the lockdown in place, I didn’t even have the illusion that I might be able to go to my favourite outdoor market or shopping mall. It sort of brought things to a head in a strange way. I realised that if I didn’t enjoy my home life, then I wouldn’t enjoy my life at all. I realised that I’d been on a lockdown long before the official one and that time was passing me by. (I joked to a friend that if it wasn’t for the shortage of toilet roll then I wouldn’t be able to tell that life was any different.) Now, even if it’s just watching a certain movie or taking the time to read a magazine, I’m determined to fit it into my schedule. At first I stayed up late, after my mother had gone to bed - and before she would wake again during the night – which meant I was even more exhausted the next day, but I’m putting my foot down and insisting that I have do my own thing during the times of the day when my mother is well enough to take care of herself. Thankfully, my mother’s meds are being improved too and that means she is doing better, which is also freeing up more of the day for us both. So, some of the restrictions caused by the quarantine have led to me having more freedom. Other restrictions caused by Covid-19 are less welcome, as far as I’m concerned. For example, on Friday the 24th of July, 2020, covering our faces in shops became compulsory. It probably wouldn’t bother me so much if I were not a carer but, as I said, my mind is already occupied and my time to faff about is limited – just having to remember to bring and wear a mask is a hassle, then I have to remember to make sure my mother is remembering  to do the same. My mother takes medication, which she needs to help with her mobility, every two and a half hours – out of that time she may only have an hour or so where she can walk and within that time we have to get to the local shops and back. If I go alone, then I know I have to back as soon as possible as my N5744 mother is alone. The other day I forgot to take my mask with me and only remembered when I arrived at the shops, so I had to rush all the way back to collect it. If I have my mother with me, there is her wheelchair to push - whether she uses it or not - and I have to keep an eye on her to make sure she is adhering to the quarantine rules (which she invariably isn’t) whilst I am grabbing groceries and keeping an eye on what time we have left because I don’t want to risk her panicking and having a meltdown if she suddenly can’t walk – and all the while I’ve got a mask on which is making my face hot and sweaty because of the muggy summer heat and it’s also making communication more difficult. My own voice is muffled by the mask I bought and I now realise, as someone who is hard of hearing in one ear, how much I rely on being able to lip read to understand what someone else is saying. If it were up to me, I would stick to online shopping, but my mother likes to visit the local shops as we don’t really have time to visit anywhere else. To add insult to injury, I see chavs breezing in and out of the stores without masks on and still getting served. This new law concerning face coverings is basically unenforceable - unless there’s a police officer there at the time - and many retailers are not going to turn away profit by refusing to serve customers without masks. I know these new quarantine measures are supposed to be in place to protect us but to be honest they just feel like an inconvenience and I question how effective they really are. (If the virus is spread primarily by touch then surely it would make more sense to make the wearing of rubber gloves compulsory in public places?) I will still follow the government’s guidelines though. I just want this pandemic to be over with as soon as possible, and if little things like wearing a mask in shops will speed up that process then I’ll do my bit. In the first days of the lockdown, the main source of stress was worrying that essentials like food, medicine and toilet roll were going to be available. It was a farcical situation for people living in a developed country like ours but the fear was very real nonetheless - perhaps more so than the fear that we might catch the coronavirus. The good thing to come out of this crisis, for me, is that it has encouraged me to have a ‘can do’ attitude, especially, as I mentioned before in regards making the best use of my free time. The quarantine measures have just been stepped up again where I live, in the north east of England, and I don’t predict the virus going away until at least sometime next year – and that’s an optimistic appraisal. There are too many ignorant - or downright defiant - people stubbornly not following the rules. The public seem to be quite happy to let the government erode their civil liberties with excessive CCTV and such like but when the powers that be tell the population to take precautions for their own safety and that of others, that’s somehow being too oppressive! It makes no sense to me. Homelife My daily routine is dictated by mother’s medication regime as it determines her likelihood of being able to be active on her own and when she is most likely to need care. It’s not her fault, but it is often frustrating for us both. We both want to get on with doing things but can be held up for hours at a time. The situation is made even more claustrophobic by not being able to go out now due to the pandemic. For instance, we used to sometimes hop in a taxi to one of various local stores for an hour to break up the day but I don’t feel safe using public transport in at the moment in case of infection. We nearly risked venturing to the city centre the other day but then heard of someone apparently catching Covid there. Sunderland is a Coronavirus hotspot but I feel confident sticking to my local shops, as that strategy got me through the first wave of the disease. I shall have to confine my retail therapy to there and online. N5744 Media and technology Recently, my mother had a video appointment with a nurse via my Samsung tablet. It spared her a painful ambulance journey to Newcastle. The video call came about by the necessity to shield my mother during the Coronavirus outbreak but I predict that such appointments will be routine in the future, like the use of contactless payments, by bank card, which were fortuitously – and, some might say, suspiciously – introduced not long before the first wave of the viral outbreak. Paying this way, of course, is safer than handling money that may be contaminated by the virus. I’m getting used to making transactions this way, although it does mean that I’m often struggling to find pocket change to pay the window cleaner when he comes. (The window cleaner is my mother’s idea. I think having a window cleaner come round once a month or a fortnight is old fashioned. No one scrubs their front door step regularly anymore – so that they could gossip with their neighbours or spy on them - nor should they wash their windows as often. Unless you’re having an affair with your window cleaner, I say dispense with their services.) We do more online shopping than we used to, which I’m glad of. I get to purchase cool stuff (like rare action figures for my collection) which I would never find locally. The only other tech I can think of that I conspicuously use are mobile phones, for the alarm function to sound when my mam is due to take her medicine rather than for actually making telephone calls. Waiting It felt like my life had gradually been put on hold over the last five years, due to caring for my mother. I don’t blame her. She didn’t choose to be ill - it’s just the way things are – but it didn’t make the scenario any less irksome. The pandemic has underlined this situation though by making the stagnation even more obvious. I don’t get to see my friends anymore but now I don’t even get to take my mother shopping in the city centre – that sort of thing. We’re waiting to have new bedroom carpets fitted but my mother needs an electric recliner chair downstairs in case she needs to rest while the carpet fitters are busy. It’s tricky enough planning a trip to the chair store that fits in with my mother’s medication schedule but now we don’t know if it’s safe to go at all because of the Coronavirus."

The only disruptions I have ‘suffered’ are all very minor. These are, my two mornings weekly volunteering in a charity shop stopped until last week. I expected to miss it but I didn’t. However now that I am back I am enjoying it as much as ever. Neither more nor less. I also stopped my weekly cafe sandwich type lunch with my husband. I also went with him for a coffee/tea most afternoons or for an ice cream & a sit on the prom in good weather. I could resume these outings but haven’t yet wanted to. My husband goes out with or without me! So I have definitely spent an awfully big amount of time at home as a result.  My extra hours at home have simply flown by in all weathers. I have extended the time I spend on crossword puzzles, jigsaws & reading. At first I was having to buy jigsaws from EBay because my charity shop is my usual source which of course was closed. So I sold the puzzles I had completed to pay for some others! My nice shop manager then brought me a massive bag of puzzles on loan from the shop for the duration so I was lucky. I really missed the library & once I had read their books I had on loan before lockdown I was so fortunate to have a literary hoarder for a sister in law! She kept me supplied throughout! The library here is now operating a system of allowing us to borrow again which is wonderful. They select ten books on selected genres then I collect them at my appointed time. This is a great idea, I am reading books which I would previously never considered. Mostly, I now realise, because of their covers. So now I wonder if all library books had plain covers would their lending rates rise or fall?  I have not been out really but I have spent a small amount of my afternoons sitting in the garden. I have really appreciated the flowers, birds & butterflies. Especially in the early weeks of lockdown when there was virtually no road traffic noise.   My home life is very much as before. I have M.S. so I am quite accustomed to amusing myself & staying home alone. My husband uses a spare room for his computer whilst I am downstairs with my puzzles, my books & T.V. He has been out every day but has only been away overnight once due to lockdown. Usually in summer he is away for a few nights every month. He had tickets for music festivals which were cancelled but he was very philosophical & cheerful although I know he was very disappointed.   The online grocery shopping was a struggle at first when everyone was panic buying. I will never understand the egg shortage. I have had my groceries delivered for several years & the only change for me was that I booked a regular guaranteed fortnightly slot for a year. Also my husband has been bringing lots more food shopping which is great for me as my online order is much smaller & hence less of a major chore.  As a household we have definitely saved a lot of money due to cafe & coffee shop closures. My husband has never had so much money which is as a result of the pub closures (tee hee). Also his train tickets & hotel bills have been dramatically reduced.   I haven’t queued at all but since going back to my charity shop I have seen the queues for McDonald’s & for TK Max. I am amazed that people bother, neither establishment is exactly necessary! And in the lovely weather too! My appointment with the optician was delayed by 5 months but it was no problem. My dental appointment has been moved to October from August (yippee!). My hearing test was cancelled & has yet to be rearranged which is only really a niggle. My sister in law cut my hair! She is in her 70’s & has very poor eyesight! She was waiting for her new stronger specs at the time! She used electric clippers on the longest setting! I resemble a superannuated coconut! This was over 3 weeks ago & it still hasn’t grown at all. Frozen with fear! But can you imagine how much I have saved on shampoo? Yes! Enough for a balaclava!"

P.S even using the word “normality” is a gross insult and I would highly recommend you think twice about referring to current life in that way again. Nothing we are experiencing now is close to normal. Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” -Quite pertinent since today while writing this “Bulb” has gone bust and I think it’s something that the lay man does not fully understand. You can argue it’s easy to blame Brexit, but I am sure it is just a contributing and not overriding factor. It appears to be another case of the rich getting richer and industries being monopolised in a capitalist, survival of the fittest style. I really feel for these small companies who have tried to make a dent on a huge market, where the almost inevitability of those at the top being the most successful and able to force those below out. We have always had energy with the main companies, mainly as they are cheaper, but events like this are also one reason behind it. The added security to go with a well-known and national company may feel weird at first, but this debacle has shown why it is important to many people. I don’t quite think rising energy bills themselves are a very notable topic, it’s almost like asking us about taxes. Because these bills only ever go in one way, that is up. To the everyday person we don’t know the costs involved with delivering and sourcing energy, so our main check on value for money is to see the profits of these companies and sadly we know many of them make billions a year, so we feel a right to be ripped off by ever increasing prices, even the regulators are struggling to keep up and have pretty much backed down over trying to cap prices to a strong extent. They will keep rising too, no one is stopping them and we can’t live without energy, especially so now the electric car revolution is upon us. The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 -In general I detest remembrance type events and I have no regard for the centenary of the poppy and I never show any support for the armed forces. I think it is abhorrent that poppy and remembrance symbolism is forced upon people…I wonder if someone would be sacked from their tv/public job if they refused to wear a poppy? I would certainly try it. Freedom of speech and freedom of choice is the cornerstone of life and should be prioritised above everything, with this event never holding that line. It does feel forced onto people and that is the worst part of it. I wish these events were up to the individual instead of the symbolism taking over public lives for the weeks leading up to it. The poppy imagery is printed on football shirts and a badge is forced upon singers, dancers and more! Just let people decide, because not supporting the poppy and remembrance does not in any way show that you are a bad person, you just don’t want to glorify past wars and think about dead people. I do hope that over time the events will become smaller and smaller, covid has actually helped with that I believe. Younger people generally also care less, it’s mainly just middle aged and older people at the events and soon they’ll die off with the tradition itself I guess. I’m very anti-armed forces in general and would 100% object to conscription if I lived in a country which had it, finding any which way possible to avoid it and spite those in power. I think it goes hand in hand with me not being at all patriotic or nationalistic, every country has good and bad points, just because you or your parents being born there does not mean I’m more proud of it. Right now I guess I am quite proud with the UK being the most free country in Europe, but pre-covid I would’ve probably had more pride in some central European countries. Abolish the mandatory poppy requirement for tv broadcasters and let people choose what they wear. The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess -I felt this was unexpected, although I expected something to happen like this a lot sooner. There’s been so little threat to politicians safety of late, a surprise to me considering what they have been voting for and how they have been acting. A part of me was a little bit disappointed that the murderer did not have current covid political motivations, because that could’ve shaken the whole world. Although will we ever know? Because what is reported in the media must never be fully believed. It must’ve been really scary for people there and you have to feel a level of sympathy for his family. I don’t think he deserved to die, but it also shows how far people could go if you are brutally evil and discriminatory in your political decisions. The amount of misery and sheer evilness behind his voting records could argue to warrant some type of punishment, but for a regular MP who seemed like a popular person in his community, it would probably be a step too far. On the whole, I am always surprised by the lack of security surrounding MP’s, especially senior ones. Seeing Boris Johnson out cycling or running in a park does make me question the security protocols as an assassination would be extremely easy with a pair of trained hands. I wouldn’t say the threat of murder is a part of the job, because if you’re a decent human being voting for uncontroversial policies then you would surely never fear this. It is why party politics is completely flawed, even by you adding ‘Conservative’ to this question, it will evoke different feelings compared to if Mr Amess was an independent for example. People will soon take things into their own hands if they believe politicians are literally ruining their lives, which is the case in some situations. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn -I honestly don’t think there’s much point writing about this much, the government are corrupt beyond belief and will do anything to make money behind people’s backs, give friends contracts they are woefully prepared for. I guess the one thing I’m most surprised about is how much media coverage the government let this have…which probably means there was a bigger story being covered up for. In any other job he would’ve been immediately suspended without pay and shortly fired, but it’s just another day at the office for a Conservative government. The U-turn came because they wanted to restore some credibility and they know so many people will believe them. The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York. -Whatever we think or whatever we do, the royal family are totally invincible. I would definitely abolish the monarchy tomorrow if I could, the fact that basically nothing is being done about Andrew just shows how flawed the justice system is within the UK and the world in general. The Epstein case has highlighted how many paedophiles are among the worlds elite and I wasn’t surprised to know the royal family was part of this. He should’ve immediately been stripped of all his royal titles, duties and income. There are no excuses for what I believe he would’ve done and I’m sure they’ll be some back hand compensation paid and that will be the end of the case. It is forever sickening how the rich and famous are beyond the law and there is so little opposition to it. People have become so normalised by the fact that people in these positions can get away with doing whatever they want without consequences, while the general public now have to worry about what words they write on the internet. Even if a trial was ever reached for Andrew, the British media and public would probably do everything they could to make sure he was innocent. He deserves less respect that anyone living on the streets, he should be in prison without other prisoners, with zero special or preferential treatment. There are no reasons why this should not happen in a fully functioning democracy and competent judicial system."

I’m angry at the complacency of the government but not surprised at all and I really hope some of those who voted for them are heavily affected as it will hopefully make some of them think twice about their decisions at the next election, but some people would vote Conservative even if they were made homeless as they would think any other government would somehow put them in a worse position which would almost not even be possible. I’m worried more about dad’s job security than anything and if any good news comes from this I’ll definitely feel some relief and it’ll make me feel a lot more free in my life and emotions if this is the case. I do feel some fear too, fear of our freedoms slowly being taken away and a much longer road to them being recovered – I think it could even be unlikely that some freedoms are not restored within the next 10 years unless protests are in place to help restore them. People power is more important than ever and we cannot let governments control our lives to such a big extent. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? -Everything will be mainly driven by money – it’s a big debate between money and keeping the people on side, but people like money so this is a lot easier than it may seem! If the 14 day quarantine measures for travellers are strictly implemented, it will absolutely crush the airline, tourism and summer job industry to a level not seen before so I do wonder if many other stipulations could come in or it could be amended or loosened to allow some type of tourists in. I think furlough will be increased but reduced, which makes absolutely no sense as for some people it’ll then make more sense to quit their job and try to find one on full pay instead of trying to survive on less income and holding out for better times which may never come as the furlough money could be extended and reduced and then finally the person loses their job which would be such a horrible, but typically capitalist situation to end up in. Figures could also be easily adjusted to fit whatever narrative the government wants as they are almost in control of the ONS and they can choose for them to publish a certain amount of deaths as there’s no way of the public researching about every single death which has taken place. Again, more of this can be found in the other directive so I don’t really want to repeat too much of it. Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. -I haven’t been watching any briefings, in fact as a family we did not watch Johnson’s address on 10th May as we kinda knew what was being said and it’s the same for the daily briefings. They’re quite pointless as little is gained from them every day and the ministers read off a sheet and are woefully underprepared aside from that. It’s a lot easier just to read the breaking news flashes and to get the news that way as it’s more concise and you don’t have to hear the ministers justifying what’s been going on or their plans which many won’t even be implemented so overall it’s a really hard sell. The older generation are from a time where politicians should be trusted and these regular broadcasts appeal to them a lot more than younger people I would say. I’ve just been getting my news via social media and online news articles and it seems the easiest way to get concise information and also you can find out things about other countries as it’s not often reported on national news as they want to avoid comparisons as they know how badly the UK is doing and they really don’t want to highlight this. Whenever figures from other countries decrease, they never report this and they are always looking to sensationalise the bad things instead of talking about recoveries and falling numbers from elsewhere and the methods they have taken in order to get to that positive stage. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? -Absolutely, we should follow Scotland’s lead! But this has been the case from the start, Sturgeon has shown great leadership throughout and little gestures like this go a long way to help some of the most marginalised in society feel part of a big community and not left out. It’s very much the same for autistic people who for many, staying inside for such a long time is crippling for them and their families and these people are often overlooked and it’s so sad to see that those who cannot fit into every generic box, get hit hardest of all. But no one I know has experienced any struggles gaining access to news, my gran gets newspapers delivered every day so this helps and she also has a tv and she’s been exploring some other channels in this period too. Audio description and sign language is a great way of making it more accessible and maybe some extra braille supplements in newspapers or magazines would also help to make it easier for everyone. Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. -Personally I am a student so I haven’t been affected financially or within the workplace during the lockdown. Uni has been very accommodating and this is the case for many unis across the country with a no detriment policy which is a really sensible thing to do and something I’m very much in support of. However it can affect your productivity as you only have to pass in order to get a respectable mark and scoring a high mark is very hard in this period due to lack of resources and the fact that everyone is very out of sync with normal life. But I believe the only reason unis have done this is in order to stop people asking for money back since we pay so much for our tuition. If fees were lower as in the rest of Europe, then this policy would probably not exist as it doesn’t exist abroad. If people are still getting a good degree they’re much less likely to want their money back but if you’re taking people’s money and failing them, then we could see the collapse of unis as institutions very quickly. The only way they can survive is with money and they can only have money if people are getting what they want from them, problem solved. Concentrating on uni work has been a lot harder during this period though but I’m trying to do work little and often and hoping this is the best way to manage it and to get ahead of deadlines which I’m used to doing anyway. -Dad however has been furloughed but he wishes he could still work, not so much for the money right now but because of the fact he is bored and isn’t used to not working. Job security is worrying though as furlough will stop at some stage and companies will not be able to afford and have the demand to bring all workers back at this stage so equally it is a worrying time. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? -Actually this isn’t a topic which I can’t write so much about since I don’t have children myself and relationships haven’t changed a whole lot. Dad has struggled a lot not being at work and he has been irritable at times but that’s about it really, mum has also struggled being inside at times and not seeing her mum as often as normal. But we’ve just tried to stay busy and in a routine which has helped to mitigate some of the factors. Although I do think that mum and dad have been able to spend more time together than over the last 25 years or so which seems pretty crazy but even them going for walks together has been really nice for them both I think. Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? -I was pretty familiar with these technologies before the lockdown so it hasn’t been much of a change, whatsapp especially since we all use it to communicate in our family anyway and that hasn’t changed, plus it’s the best way to speak to people in different countries so I’ve been very used to using it before. I haven’t used house party as I don’t really have enough friends for that! Plus most of my friends are individual and not in a group so this doesn’t really work in this case, plus I’ve seen a lot of stories about it being hacked and taking people’s details so I’m glad I avoided it and I’m not really into that kinda thing anyway…it seems to be something which is for the popular people and those who enjoy parties and pub quizzes. I’ve tried my best to video chat with friends during this period but some people prefer doing it to others, some like messaging and others don’t really like it at all so its been a mixed experience with everything. I’m not a huge fan of video chatting anyway as I really enjoy speaking on messages more but it’s better than nothing so I’ve done it now and again. Uni used Zoom in order to do our online classes and it is a really good platform, don’t we all wish we brought some shares in it a few months ago! Some tutors have been a little uncomfortable using it and I really feel for them as there’s a lot of pressure on them to adjust really quickly to something totally new and my tutors have honestly done a great job with it so I’m pleased for them and hopefully they have felt happy too. I don’t think online classes can be the future though, it’s a very different experience and not at all worth the money which we pay for it. If they do decide to have some degrees online from September, I guarantee that many students will defer or pull out and this will have huge implications for the uni industry, renting industry and job industry! I don’t think people understand student power and how important it can be. If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? -This has really depended on the person in question…I have tried to re-connect with people who have drifted away from me by messaging them and checking in on them to show that I care and sometimes this has proven successful, but overall it sadly hasn’t and I’ve really found this hard as I thought it would be the perfect time to reconnect and most people have told me that this has been the case which has frustrated me more as I haven’t been able to pull it off. I’ve always struggled socially and this felt like my opportunity to put it right but sadly it hasn’t been the case but there are still some positives to take away and these are important for me. It hasn’t been a pressure at all as I enjoy talking online and I’ve really tried to grasp that but its hard if I have friends who I want to stay close to but they don’t like speaking online as this is just a terrible situation, especially if these people are still living with other friends or are breaking rules and seeing them during this period while I’m at home not seeing anyone. I do worry about a lot of my international friends since they’re lockdown restrictions are getting relaxed so it means they can see friends a lot sooner than me and I definitely worry about being left behind…just as I was starting to make some real social progress too which is the sad thing as I don’t want that progress to be lost. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? -I’m on social media a lot in general and I would say my use of social media has been relatively the same over this period, maybe a little more on Twitter but really not a whole lot much. I think it’s the best place to check in with news instead of news channels though as it can only be short and concise on twitter and that’s all you really want to know about it. It’s definitely very hard to escape from things and social media doesn’t really let you do that as there’s always some type of Corona post around the corner, whether it be good or bad and that’s just a part of life now. I don’t use Facebook a whole lot anyway, maybe just check it once or twice a day and that’s really it and I don’t think it’s a good place for news as people are on it more than other social media so it’s a lot easier to spread fake news and for people to be angry with the comments in this case and it’s quite a toxic social media nowadays. Twitter is sadly becoming like that too but it’s still a good place for news and to try to judge public opinion although that’s very hard since I think in general there’s more left-wing than right-wing people on twitter and that definitely doesn’t reflect society in general sadly. And year Instagram is fine, like I enjoy it to see what’s going on in people’s lives and you also get a good sense over who’s breaking the rules by seeing the posts on there and who people are with and it’s always a place to go which can then make you feel jealous about other people’s lives but that’s also the way it has always been. What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? -My parents have done the food shopping during this period but previously I would go with my gran each week and help her but we have limited the number of people going to the shops so it can be done efficiently and as safely as possible. At first, many key items such as pasta and rice were missing but these have slowly been replenished. Some things such as eggs and flour still have a shortage and although this is the case, it’s frustrating that the item limit is still kept in place as there is no real reason for it and no end in sight as to when it might be removed which again worries me about other restrictions which will be put in place over the coming weeks and month. My parents have usually chosen times when they do not believe there will be large queues at the shops, such as early morning or in the evening to prevent waiting times but sometimes this can be hard as its hard to know when the shops will be at their busiest. Sometimes people in the shops have not been respectful, other customers and not staff, and there’s nothing you can do about this and if people are not going to keep distance, its just tough really and this will continue in many different places for months to come. Ideally, we would’ve wanted to do the shopping online but my dad doesn’t quite qualify for the most at risk category so this hasn’t been possible sadly and does increase the risk by going to the shop. We tried to book some slots by keep looking on the websites and we could’ve got one Ocado slot a few weeks ago but it was right after they went shopping so there wasn’t much point and now they’ve kinda given up with that since stocks are higher and queues are generally lower. The idea of giving slots to the most ill and vulnerable is a good idea but it doesn’t always work since the most vulnerable are usually the ones with no connection to the internet to be able to do this and not all of them have family who can help out or do the shopping for them. There was a big market to employ more people to pick food and deliver it to a larger range of the population but this didn’t happen quite to the extent I think it could’ve done. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? -I don’t really cook personally so my cooking habits have remained minimal and unchanged! But we’ve definitely changed as a household, mainly actually because everyone is at home so everyone can eat at the same time and therefore everyone can have the same meal. This has been half a conscious decision to save money but also because of circumstances. We’ve eaten a lot more meat based products as we have tried to buy cheap, large quantities and divide it out for different meals e.g. making meatballs or mince for a homemade lasagne. We always had a lot of homemade meals but I think that has increased over this period, especially as ready meals are just a little more expensive and the fact there’s less choice over them at the moment too, since a lot more people are buying them. I’ve also had to drink less milk due to the quantity limits in shops as we haven’t gone shopping as often and therefore cannot buy as much milk and instead I’ve had to have some fruit squash to subsidise for the lack of milk, although due to having eczema flared up by fruit, this isn’t ideal but hasn’t actually affected it too much in this period luckily. We did buy a lot of food pre-lockdown so we’ve slowly used this up over the period and it was definitely a big help to stock up on food beforehand as it meant that we didn’t have to go out as often in the more difficult periods and our outgoings reduced as our income did as well. We’ve continued to make homemade cakes, bread and other things in this period which has been super nice and it’s another thing for my mum and sister to spend time on and that’s always a good thing right now too. But personally, my eating times and what I’ve eaten hasn’t changed a whole lot. We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? -I haven’t really taken up any new hobbies since a lot of my time has been spent working on uni stuff or having/preparing for online classes so right now there hasn’t been so much change in my life compared to normal which has probably allowed me to cope a lot better than some people, especially on a personal level. Routine has been key to all of this and to entertaining myself actually since I have had a fairly set routine which has included a 5km walk at the start of each day and this is an increase from any exercise I would do when I’m just at home, but if I was going to uni for example I’d probably walk around 6km/7km a day anyway so compared to this its kinda similar really. We’ve also been playing board games which we enjoyed doing before anyway but now we’ve been able to play more of them and more often which has been nice and also we’ve had a mini pool table we’ve been able to put on the patio outside so I guess playing this to a higher standard has been one new skill I’ve learnt but we did do this occasionally in previous summers. I’ve also tried to become a more skilled video gamer playing Gran Turismo Sport as in the official championship last year I was top-15 in UK but since I don’t put in hours a day like some people, I was hoping to match that again this year with a lot less practice than most people. Dad has done a lot of DIY jobs and house maintenance so all of this is now up to date instead of being staggered throughout the year but it isn’t something which I do myself. There are also lots of repeats of tv shows on at the moment and some I enjoy watching if I haven’t seen them since my childhood but dad will watch shows and films over and over again and he almost pretends he’s never seen them before which really isn’t something I can do at all. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. - I’m not a particularly big listener of anything really, including music, so I haven’t been  listening to anything new or different in this period. Sometimes I play pop music while  playing video games to relax me but that’s about it and I’ve also never read an audio book  before!  - Reading wise, it’s been mainly academic stuff related to my Masters dissertation and this has  meant that I haven’t had the chance to read anything for pleasure and that is the problem  with being a student at times as you don’t really have as much desire to read for pleasure  when you’re reading academic articles most days.  - I have been watching a lot of new tv series during this period as tv series aren’t something  which I watch as much as most other people of my age but I have very much enjoyed getting  into them, albeit on illegal websites. I firstly watched “You” which I enjoyed although maybe  it didn’t quite live up to expectations. And then I watched “Project Blue Book” which is very  much my type of show about conspiracies etc but again I was slightly underwhelmed and  now I’m watching “Mindhunter” which is different again being a crime show but I’m maybe  enjoying this one more than the other series. All of these have been recommendations by  friends since I also want to be able to speak to people about the shows I’m watching as my  taste in series is very different to my parents really.  Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? -Yes it has actually, I am still having a shower and washing my hair once a day in the morning and that hasn’t changed but I am shaving less and its probably a habit which I will carry forward into the future. I wasn’t that bothered about not shaving before but I just built it into a weekly routine and now that its hard to maintain a routine, I’ve just shaved when I wanted to as a result and I don’t feel any better or worse about it, I just think it something I’d prefer not to do and therefore I’ve just done it less. The whole idea of needing to be clean shaven in order to be presentable is very old fashioned now anyway despite some people still thinking it’s a requirement of jobs when this in fact has long gone. It’s more fashionable and possibly even more desirable to have stubble or some form of a beard anyway. Of course my hair is growing since I’ve been unable to get it cut but we ordered some hair clippers and a shaver so dad’s can be cut as he doesn’t like it getting long at all whereas I’m a little less worried about it and I got my hair cut before lockdown anyway so it hasn’t got to a critical level yet! We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. -I’ve heard a lot of stories about people having weird and wonderful dreams and it’s definitely been the same here too. My sleeping has been pretty good until the start of May but that’s mainly been due to the fact it’s so light in the morning and not other factors. Keeping in a sleeping routine has been important since then your sleeping pattern isn’t disturbed and I’ve never been someone who can stay up super late anyway so in all honesty it hasn’t affected me so much and I think the same can be said for my mum and sister. Dad has been getting up early as he finds it hard to sleep a lot and he’d rather be doing things instead of sleeping which is understandable, but sometimes he’ll stay up late to watch films and I think this can mess with the sleeping patterns too. -In terms of dreams, I have had some nightmares but they’ve been aeroplane ones which are very common for me, so common I have a log with how often I have them and it’s often a couple of times a month and this has been unchanged. The planes usually crash and fall out of the sky with me on the ground looking on helplessly. The two most vivid dreams I have had have both been about crushes of some sort – the first featured online friend LS who I rarely speak to but I very much enjoy it when we do speak and at this point I had not spoken to her for maybe a month or more which is why it was extremely random. It was almost as if we were married and she was in her wedding dress and we were going to a quiz night at uni and it was about motorsport which is a common topic of ours and when I woke up from the dream it prompted me to message her and she replied and said how nice it was to hear from me so I wonder if it was trying to tell me, or even her, something. My other vivid dream was about famous racing driver SF who I have had a connection with in the past, almost at a friendly type level 5 years ago which seems absolutely crazy looking back at things now. But the dreams were twofold, one at a racetrack and we were spectating together which I guess was kinda normal and standard and then another with her in my room and we were just cuddling and chilling out and it reminded me of good times we spent together, obviously not at all intimate and this came on the five year anniversary of a really special day in both of our lives so dreams seem to have a lot more meaning in this period which is interesting."

In my case, this was my partner. The request had been sent out widely round the country. On the first four occasions a PCR test was taken weekly, followed by monthly visits that still continue. The first was in early October 2020; the most recent in August 2021.  These were swab tests, but we have additionally been asked to take blood antibody tests since June 2021. We were pleased to be asked to participate in this trial, as we had been able to do very little for anyone else up to this point in the pandemic.  It seemed as if we were at last contributing something, however minimal, to the huge effort going on in research institutes and hospitals, for example. We received a payment each time we undertook a test. Though we would have taken the test for altruistic reasons without payment, we accepted and redistributed it via foodbanks and other similar charitable organisations. Early negative results on this project are sent to participants several days later by post (now email).  I understand that if the result is positive, participants are contacted by phone.  We did not have to navigate an online testing system. Test appointments are usually made by phone the day before and visits take place at the doorstep. We and they wear face masks. Swab kits are placed on the doormat for us to pick up.  While one of us does the test, the other is asked a set of questions: for example, have we been in contact with anyone who was found to be Covid-positive in the last so-many days; how many times a week do we go out; have we been abroad, and so forth. We have been fortunate that our 13 swab tests have all come back negative. Perhaps this is unsurprising since for many months we lived in isolation from friends and family, except for periods when lockdown was released. It is perhaps ironic that we placed the letters containing our test results in the quarantine box inside the front door for 24 hours before they were opened.  But then at one point there were rumours that the post was taking far longer than usual to arrive locally because of a Covid outbreak at the local sorting office. Because we are in the vulnerable group by age, it made good sense to live by the rules throughout the pandemic. Since June 2021 we have been asked to take anti-body tests at the same time as the lateral flow test. This means taking drops of blood from a finger to partly fill a small test tube. Following two Covid jabs, it has been a relief to learn that we have antibodies.  Female; 67; married; Village in Suffolk; retired Associate Lecturer at the Open University M6790 Everyday testing In addition to the 13 tests taken for the ONS/Oxford project, in the last few months I have also taken three lateral flow tests (from kits collected at the local pharmacy) before meeting people. I used these test kits because some of the people I was meeting were vulnerable and I wanted to be sure I wouldn’t pass anything on to them. Collecting samples for these kits was much the same as with the ONS/ University of Oxford project but with LTF tests you read your own result, rather than submitting the sample to the project. LTF results are then returned via the government website. Views on testing In a word, the test and trace system appears to have been shambolic! This scheme seemed to be one of the least efficient parts of all the work in the NHS and other sectors during the pandemic. It remains to be seen how a post-Covid enquiry will view the scheme and its management. There are concerns about the accuracy of all tests but we must take it on ourselves to have a re-test if we are seriously worried about the result or display any Covid symptoms."

Some of my activities continued, but not those which required me to be elsewhere or in company with others.  Even so, there has always been much more that I wanted to do each day, than I actually managed to fit in.  I have done a lot of reading and learning – although the main foreign language I have studied has been Italian, and I had intended to go back to learning Russian (not enough time).  I have done some writing – poems, a long self-isolation diary for MO, another 40,000 words of my autobiography for my grandsons, and above all many emails, all either generally chatty, like over a back fence to a neighbour, or intended to be deliberately cheering to those who had found the lockdown very difficult to endure (friends in America and Germany, as well as here).  I've been involved with helping at a distance a brother-in-law who is terminally ill with a cancer, and his wife.  Much of the latter two activities have involved a lot of discussion and planning with my wife.  I have extended my cooking abilities into cake-baking, as well as being responsible for all the cooking in alternate weeks.  I have continued with modelling activities, putting into effect two overdue improvements on my railway layout, and making from scratch quite a lot of new goods stock (the layout is set around 1910 in Sussex, and everything is hand-built).  I have continued to try to learn the piano, focussing on Peter Maxwell Davis, 'Farewell to Stromness', the score of which was given to me last Christmas.  I have worked much in the garden, and in the community allotment nearby, although I was hampered by not being able to obtain seed for many weeks.  I have walked regularly each day, although probably less than the 3-4 miles I covered each day previously.  Recently, once small groups have been able to meet together, I have started to learn handbell ringing, since my normal tower ringing has not been possible.   All of this has amply filled each day.  The real loss has been not being able to meet together, for reading and poetry groups, for choirs, for church services, and for bell-ringing, as well as normal social contact and visiting.  So for me, any change back to a different kind of normality would feature place and people, not time.  I believe that I have used my time profitably and wisely, both before and during the pandemic.  Rhythm and routine of the day, and Homelife Ah now, here there have been problems.  When one becomes older, it is vital that there are routines in life.  It contributes enormously to overall health; it ensures dementia is kept at bay; it helps one to lead a full and productive life.  The rhythms may be different from those forced on one by work, but nevertheless, they exist.  Daily, weekly and yearly routines are all part of a healthy lifestyle.  Much of this has gone by the board.  We would be spending all the day together, at home, so there would be no pattern of each of us leaving the house for meetings of various kinds and returning at different times.  We set up the routine of going for our permitted walk early, about 6 am, or as soon as it was light.  This had the advantage of being fresh, of producing wonderful early light on the landscape and sea, and of giving us privacy.  We then began the custom of coffee/tea break at a few minutes to eleven, to which we quickly added home-made cake (it has to be gluten-free), and usually a coffee break without cake in mid-afternoon.  This sometimes did not take place, since either or both of us were often exhausted, as we experienced recurrence of the virus we first had last November.  Our cooked evening meal was timed for 6 pm, not that we feel meals have to be on time and on the dot, but for the sake of a routine.  Our lunch was always a sandwich, eaten (unusually for us) in front of the television while enjoying Bargain Hunt on BBC1.  We did not manage to establish a weekly routine.  On our early-morning walks, my wife returned with a pebble to mark each day and made a sort of primitive calendar in the front porch; on Sundays, she collected a small shell from the beach instead.  This shows the first four weeks, up to Easter Sunday.    In one sense the annual rhythms of nature became stronger for us, because we were able to mark the detailed changes during our walks – which plants were in flower; birds nesting, migrants coming and going, the gathering of rooks for tree-top conferences, which ends in early spring; the position of the sun at dawn, and the height to which it rises by the summer solstice – these were clearer to detect, and feel part of.  But superimposed on this was the artificial rhythm of lockdown: the failures to secure food deliveries; the early dash to the shops to buy food before they became crowded; the cancelling of holidays and trying to re-plan; the absence of any kind of social contact other than ourselves; the regular daily briefings from Downing Street; the utter frustration when we were without our computer for two separate weeks; the wait of delivery of items ordered online; the constant speculation of how long it would all last.  All of these things suddenly assumed a new, and sometimes vital, importance, and certainly led to increased mental strain.  Since the freeing of lockdown we have established the routine of meeting every one or two weeks on a Friday with other members of the church community, in our gardens.  This does give a little rhythm, and we can look forward to seeing each other's gardens (and how the drought is making things parched).  I am writing this in mid-August 2020, and the pattern of re-establishing local lockdowns is emerging, as well as self-isolation if one has been stupid enough to travel out of the country.  Various vaccines are in stage 3 of their trials, so there is the possibility of an effective one emerging, but that is really only going to be effective once it is cheap enough for the whole world to be vaccinated, and if some 80% + actually are vaccinated.  In other words, life as we have had to adapt to it is not going to become different for many, many months or years; it is unlikely to become easier; and will look nothing like our life up to the end of 2019.  Homelife  This has been covered while considering rhythms.    Media and technology  I have used my desk-top computer enormously in recent months: in studying foreign languages, sending e-mails, keeping abreast of the news and ordering items for delivery.  Life would have been possible without it, but very different and very limiting.  One member of our church group is in her 80s and has no computer, so we have done our best keeping her in touch with events, while others have been emailing frequently and using WhatsApp.  We also were able to sort out a plumbing emergency for her, all thanks to modern technology.  I envisage continuing to use these technologies in the present way.  I have never enjoyed 'going shopping' and see even less point in that now.  We have tried using Zoom with our bell-ringers, but it was not very successful, partly because it was not well led, and partly because constant technical problems arose.  We also tried to combine this with a new application called Ringing Room, but this behaves differently on different pieces of equipment, so we were unable to progress.  I have continued to use notes, lists and a wall calendar, as before, though my wife places more reliance on her phone calendar than I do.  The biggest change for me has been in making card payments for everything.  Previously I tended to pay cash for bills under £10, but not now.  I foresee a drastic reduction in the number of coins and monetary notes in circulation!   Waiting  I do feel very much that my life has been put on hold.  Since our doctor-daughter insisted that we self-isolated a full week before it became general policy for people of my age, we both felt as if we'd been locked away and forgotten.  At first we did manage to secure two delivery slots (only three days apart) but so many essentials were not available (Almost a week without bread) that it became a huge worry.  Our daughters were very busy and for a month, nobody inquired about us – although we did meet offers of help from two lovely neighbours, one of whom we'd never met before.  I also hated being referred to as 'vulnerable', since I aim to keep myself physically and mentally fit, and the label, constantly used, simply disabled me.  I take a holistic view of my health, so that includes my spiritual, creative and social sides as well as physical and mental, and they were badly hit.  My GP takes this view too, so our previous regular meetings were face-to-face, and ranged widely, and we both looked forward to and benefited from them.  This time it was a quick phone call on a scarcely audible line, and was solely about my physical body.  I cannot help feeling that part of this issue of time is the time-bomb of mental stress, particularly amongst the lonely and elderly, which has not yet exploded, and which no younger people seem to be aware of.  One type of waiting we've experienced has concerned my brother-in-law, now aged 88.  In December he was diagnosed with liver cancer, which is terminal.  He lives 200 miles from us, in the place where we ourselves lived until 19 years ago, so we want to visit while there is still the chance to.  We visited in January, and then in early March, when, thank goodness!  We fought to get him sent home from the care home he was currently in.  We then could not visit until mid-July, and then found him seriously worse.  We planned to visit again in mid-August, to coincide with his birthday – but then cancelled it when a huge spike was caused in that area by selfish, idiotic youngsters crowding out a pub in mid-Staffs.  The surge seemed to slow, so at the last minute we re-booked the hotel and did manage to pay a visit.  That was a piece of waiting and worrying we could well have done without.  I said above that I aim to keep myself physically and mentally fit, but actually, last November, I was infected with a virus, and soon after my wife was, and we both found it very debilitating with a strange range of symptoms, not things we had experienced before.   Every few weeks, the symptoms return, and this makes if very difficult to plan to do things, even after the lockdown ended.  When I consulted the GP last week, she opined that we had certainly had Covid-19, for it was definitely around in the community in Britain in November.  But neither of us has any antibodies, so it could return with even fuller force at any time.  So in a sense, we are just waiting for that to happen.  Actually, that it too negative, for we really are trying to get on with our interests, as outlined at the beginning of this response.  But I am resigned to never flying again to any country, however interesting, and to not being able to go on a long-distance coastal walk again (a precious joy!) for fear of having a debilitating recurrence.  Maybe, in time, these events will fade or even go away, but that will be a long and uncertain wait."

I was apprehensive the first time as other people had said that they were unpleasant. I found it OK, although when you do it on your own you are never quite sure if you have done it correctly, even when you follow the instructions; it is very hard, for example, to avoid touching your tongue! The test kits were given to me, so I did not have to navigate any systems to get the tests. Everyday testing I have had four tests for Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Two were lateral flow tests and two were tests as part of a research project; I think one would have been something like a PCR test and the other an antigen test (to see if I have got antibodies). All the tests were done at home and the 2 research ones were sent off for analysis. For all tests I benefitted, for the lateral flow tests people around me benefitted and for the research tests everyone will ultimately benefit as these will be included in research project data. I have been hesitant before a holiday as this would have had significant impact on my ability to go. As I was already double-vaccinated and had no symptoms, in the end I decided not to take a test (the holiday was in the UK). I did not particularly like the experience of doing the lateral flow test – rather unpleasant and I was not sure even then if I had done it right! Views on testing I think that Test and Trace is a very sensible idea in principle but I have had concerns about its implementation, firstly in relation to support for anyone required to self-isolate. This is a legal requirement but even so there is no support for many people. I know that a payment is available to people on Universal Credit (but even that seems to be very hard to get your hands on and people in this situation have no backup) but the assumption that everyone else can magically afford to be unpaid for 10 days betrays, to me, a pretty appalling lack of understanding about the conditions under which most people work. I now work, again, for an employer from whom I get a reasonable amount of sick leave. For the 5 years prior to this I worked for companies from whom I got, officially, no sick leave. A lot of people are in this position. For most people, even those on a good salary, to assume that they can cover the losses ‘for Queen and Country’ as it were, is pretty insulting and I suspect that people will have carried on working, if they could, because they had no choice, thus undermining the system.  I was also pretty annoyed when it was announced that one of the measures taken to make the NHS Covid-19 app ‘less sensitive’ was to reduce the contact period it used from 5 days to 2 days. ??!!!. Why ever was it 5 days anyway when the Test and Trace programme only looked at contacts over the preceding 2 days? Finally, when we were only holiday my husband and I went out for a meal. We sat outside and the tables had been well arranged so we were definitely at least 2m from any other diners. We signed in using the NHS Covid-19 app, as requested. In discussion with the proprietor, however, none of us knew what would have happened if he had been notified that a customer, or he or his staff, had tested positive. In theory, as we were meeting all the other rules, that should not have affected us, but we didn’t know that and neither did he. I think that vagueness has affected confidence in the system and in any potential outcomes – it certainly has affected mine.  I have no concerns about the accuracy of Covid-19 tests per se; they do what they do. I am not sure how many people understand the limitations of each, however. So, I have concerns about the understanding of what Covid-19 test results mean. More confusion."

F. 75. Married. Shoreham-by-sea. Ward clerk/artist.UK EVENTSCovid. Jan 2022. There is no normality for us! We're retired with a nice house + garden, so our 'normal' is being in lockdown! Our grown up children are back too work, and our grandchildren back at school. We're still not going to crowded places, and am getting fed up of looking at concerts or events advertised in the press causing a rush of anticipation immediately quashed by the realisation we won't be going. We missed Tim Minchin last year, and lost the tickets as they couldn't be re-sold. Friends are not gathering in groups, Though we have been to someones house, restaurants, distanced pubs, but not often, and because we've had 2 jabs and a booster. I would love to go to London on the train!ENERGY BILLS. We are in the very fortunate position of being able to afford any bills that come our way, though we had transferred our account to a 'green' provider which went bust. And we're very mean about heating anyway, so it's not a problem only having heating on at essential times and wearing lots of clothes. Heating is an essential in the winter - it should not be seen as a luxury. As with food. RED POPPIES. Don't like these. I'm of a mind that the 'armed' 'force's continue the possibility of war. Remember when the monarch who had the good idea of starting a war, also went to war at the head of his army. 'Put your money where your mouth is'."

Personally I decided in March 2020 to follow the guidelines and took seriously the12 week lockdown. I also was ready to be vaccinated; as again it felt like the right thing to do as a citizen and to protect the NHS. I have been very impressed by the rollout of vaccinations and later the boosters. The result is -that to date, I have not had the Covid 19 infection. The restrictions have not been a major issues for me apart from missing seeing family and friends as I would have done ‘normally’. As time has gone on -from the Summer of 2020, I have felt less trusting of the government’s response and more inclined to read medical reports. Returning to pre Covid life, I think will take some time. Covid will join the list of illnesses one might get. * Rising energy bills and energy companies going “ bust” This is an issue which I don’t fully understand. Have prices been too low? The only thing I have heard is about the rise in demand on the wholesale global market which has resulted in increased prices. Also read that there’s are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which means many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems. Has this got anything to do with climate change? Is it that more energy supplier will have to change from fossil fuels? Don’t think so. We changed our energy supplier to Ecotricty a local green energy supplier, some years ago, fully aware that it would mean higher prices. But I think the greater demand may be due to changes in weather patterns, putting demand for more heat or more air conditioning; with unexpectedly cold winters in some places, warmer summers in others. * The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921. The is another conflicting area for me to debate. I dislike the almost fashion status that has grown in the wearing of red poppies. Some are like pieces of jewellery. However “ less one forgets” has world wide and individual meaning which I think is very important. So I’m left wondering if the support of the Arm Forces ought to continue but the national Remembrance Day maybe needs to change. Some young people have no direct memory of either WW1 or WW2. Part 3 : Events UK continued. A5854 Female, 76, married Bath, artist The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Ames’s. Tragic for him and his family. Awful that such killings happen to people serving the community as public figures. I am not a supporter of the Conservative Party but this man was going an honourable job as a Member of Parliament. In no way do I condone this killing. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U -turn. Is is the other side of the coin in some ways. A good long serving man is killed and another behaves in a way not fit for the responsibility in-trusted in him. I believe the Tory Party is in decline. The law suit involving Prince Andrew, Duke of York . Gosh, I’m not interested in Prince Andrew. But I am interested in exposing child abuse and those involved being punished."

A5854 Female, 75, married Bath, artist Five words.. Balance, Harmony, Resilience, Pain-free, Goodfood Health = feeling well, not in pain or suffering. Well feed but not over feed on good food, Able to get good dentist, GP, alternative therapies when needed Well-being = living in relaxed warm home, access to outdoors, creative, good -relationships, life/ work balance Imagine Healthy body = good clear skin and hair, body weigh stable and not grossly over-weight, strength in muscles. Influences on my experience of health & wellbeing Gender: being female I am aware of a heightened concern about my body image, how I ought to look, especially in western world. Not so much in my youth as I feel it is for my granddaughter. Ethnicity: not aware of ethnicity issues myself until I was much older when I became more aware of ‘ white privilege’ Social Class: as a child our family had high status, (my father was a clergyman) but low income and we only had money for essentials. As an adult I am much more comfortably off financially and as an educational woman I am able to ask for help and usually I am listened too. Sexually Orientation: as a married heterosexual woman I fit the norm and I think that still makes life easier. I don’t have to defend myself or feel I have to justify myself. Early Experience FOOD = As a family we are all meals together at either the kitchen table or more formally occasionally at the dinning room table. It was at the kitchen table that there might be conversations about food. Mainly about eating certain foods that weren’t necessarily favourites. Also eating everything UP. This was OK. Food was good. My father grew vegetables, my mother baked and made bread. It was a basic menu not very exotic; it was after Second World War and there was still rationing until late 1950’s I remember my father had a thing about chewing your food thoroughly. He also was the only one in the family who had a habit of eating between meals; he did put on weight and after a heart attack in his 50’s he changed this habit and lost a lot of weight. We were a tea total family and no one smoked. Part 2: Everyday Health and Well-being continued.. A5854 Female, 75, married Bath, artist REGARDING HEALTH = my brother and I were not vaccinated as babies for the major child diseases. My father had some objection to vaccines which I’m not clear about. So my brother and I got hooping cough, measles, mumps. We both had lasting effects from these. My brother’s eyes were weaker after measles and hooping cough left me with a sensitive throat and coughing even without having a cold. My mother also noticed that my growth slowed when I was a baby for a while. After medical tests and going to Children’s Department at St Bartholomew’s hospital in London who monitored me for years. It was thought that I had a slight attack of poliomyelitis. This left me with a slightly weak and smaller left side. However I don’t think we had chats about Health and Wellbeing at home. At secondary school there were classes called Domestic Science which included a memorial week when a group of three of us played house in a special flat within the school. We had to run it together as a home, cleaning, cooking etc. There was also weekly classes which included a wide range of topics from sex education, nutrition, to budgeting. A break though moment in relation to in-depth sex education was after I was married, living in USA and came across the work of Betty Dodson, especially her book ‘Masturbation.’ It was in the USA that I also got to know more about what gets called alternative or contemporary medicine. While in USA we were fortunate to have health insurance cover provided by a enlightened health group called Kaiser Permantente. Back in UK in 1975 with two young children we all seemed very healthy for some years. Maybe took good health for granted. Our lifestyle was active and we ate well. When I slipped a disc however I didn’t go to GP but to an osteopath. I feel this was the beginning of us not relying on GP/ NHS for treatment only. I have had a very good relationship with the GP’s and appreciate they skills for diagnosis. I’m aware that then I often make my own decisions about what treatment to go for the symptoms. Sometimes it will be to take prescription drugs, and medical treatment, other times turn to a contemporary treatment like acupuncture. As I have got older I have had more reasons to take more care of my health. The disparity of my legs has resulted in a knee replacement when I was 72, treatment for cataracts in my 60’s. We have moved towards being more vegetarian and follow the 5/2 eating routine. I have taken attention to my mental health seriously. Had counselling and also physiotherapy when I felt that I had emotional issues that need extra attention-more that I felt appropriate to share with friends and family. Very aware of ageing and that I’m slower and get tired, at the same time I feel well and enjoying life. Appearance. Always important. I’m tall, have good skin and had almost black hair, now almost white. Enjoy having good clothes and take pride in my appearance. I have never worn much makeup but since I got older I see that my face has lost definition, so I do now use lipstick and a little eye makeup. I now think I look better with glasses! I do look in the mirror before I go out. Jan 5 202u"

I doubt he will go to prison but that is where he should be. The big stories today are that Russia might invade the Ukraine at any hour. The same applies to Taiwan, being invaded by china.

MO H6031 Part 2: COVID-19 Okay the summer directive has just landed in my inbox, time I got on with the Spring Directive that was sent out at the beginning of May. With the benefit of some hindsight. The Covid 19 pandemic like its victims sort of came very slowly with knowledge of its existing arriving early in the New Year 2020, and then the giant wave of realisation hitting us around the end of February. We, as a couple, were actually in the USA, Florida, the last week in January and on a Gulf of Mexico Cruise the first week in February and the topic of Covid 19 was not being talked about generally but the cruise company had taken initial steps as people who had been to China recently were not beiheng allowed to join the cruise. It is now early August 2020 and I have been at my work throughout the period, so in some respects things have remained normal. Things have changed at work, many of the office based staff are working from home – I know they are busy working on their computers, dealing with emails, on zoom meetings but I really wonder what value they are all adding to the business as they work in the production end of the distilling business and at some stage someone is going to ask the same question -how many litres of product is your job helping to produce? At the actual physical distillery, there was initially a period of scampering about with people, who either themselves or close members of their family were “Shielding” – assessed as more at risk, basically furloughed off. There were also a few who had to self-isolate as they potentially came into contact with others who were identified has having caught Covid 19, of around 150 people there has so far been 1 person onsite who has had covid 19. Although my wife received a letter stating she was in this group, who should shield, we never felt that this was an issue that needed me to be off my work, up until now. The business quickly introduced social distancing and temperature monitoring. Basically all the work areas have restrictions on the number of people that can be in enclosed areas, work that requires people to be within 2 meters is not done or a specific Risk Assessment done and PPE usage increased. Temperature monitoring is done at the beginning of each working day, and as there are shifts this continues throughout the day, with 100% checks done each and every day for everyone who comes on site. Both the social distancing and temperature monitoring have become a bit more sophisticated as the months have went by. Home life has also seen changes. My mum is 83 and is in relatively good health, but I now do her shopping. This has been relatively straight forward as she has been getting meals (Wiltshire) delivered to her home for a good couple of years now, however there have been minor challenges. As people get older they get more set in their ways and a couple of examples will perhaps paint a picture. Early on during the “lockdown” there was a sudden rush for cleaning materials –also toilet rolls for some reason that I still don’t really understand. My mum gives me her shopping list weekly and on an early one there was a fairly specific item “Sarson’s Malt Vinegar”, this was a bit of a surprise as my memory of staying at home was that she and my Dad did not like vinegar but I thought to myself that she possibly had a particular recipe that required this particular vinegar. When I was shopping I was unable to get this vinegar, but a couple of weeks later it was back in stock so I got it, so I thought, and it was duly delivered. However the next week my mum told me I had got the wrong vinegar “Sorry but this was what was on the list!” was my response, she wanted Sarson’s White Malt Vinegar. Turns out she uses and has used this for years to clean her kettle, I almost went in with both feet to explain that the acidic vinegar would be used to dissolve the lime scale that is prevalent in the south of England but not an issue in Fife but realised that logic verses habit was not an argument I was going to win in my life time. The second example is one that I have Male, 62, Married, Glenrothes, Distillery Worker. MO H6031 won, as part of the winding up of my dad’s estate one of the things the Solicitor suggested and which my mum agreed too was for me to get Power of Attorney. Basically I had a letter from the Solicitor that gave me this but I had never had reason to use. However early on in the “lockdown” my mum realised she was going to need a new cheque book and as she could not get out to go to the bank, how was she going to get one. My initial attempt at phoning the bank and asking on her behalf didn’t work and my mum hung up on the bank when they asked her some basic details, she is very aware and frightened of the scams that occur. I decided that it would be sensible to enact the Power of Attorney so that I could officially intercede on my mum’s behalf. This was done and one of the major benefits is that I am also able to help my mum by using “Internet Banking” only she doesn’t know as she doesn’t trust Internet Banking. The other things that have changed is the way that we do our shopping, with restrictions placed on the number of people allowed in the Supermarket, if there is one business that must be doing well out of the Covid 19 it must be Supermarkets as they were largely the only shops allowed to stay open, I very quickly discovered that humans being creatures of habit still insist on doing their shopping on Thursday, Friday and Saturday but not Saturday evening. So we now do our shopping then and although this sometimes restricts the choice it is still much much quieter and hence safer. Other thoughts. It is fairly obvious that the Covid 19 virus is dangerous and deadly to specific parts of the population, older, have other illnesses and overweight people. Some of the background illnesses which cause people to be particularly susceptible to the virus are I believe linked to older overweigh people and although it has been possible for the government, not just in the UK but fairly well throughout the world, to restrict the movement and interaction of the whole population this is clearly not going to be a solution for very much longer. The current generations of people, certainly in the richer parts of the world, have been living through a long period when people dying of disease has become rare, however we are still animals and nature has a way of ensuring that life needs to be strong and healthy to survive and much of the current anguish that we and our Health Services are having to deal with, is that there is currently no magic cure to this virus. Looking at the statistics, and unless there is something very wrong with the testing results, there are still relatively small numbers of people who have had Covid 19, so herd immunity is a long way off. (There are world-wide 19 million confirmed cases out of an estimated world 7800 million population, so even if the true number of people were 5 times or even 10 times, 190 million, the number known to have had Covid 19 we have got a hell of a mountain to climb) Although this is a new pandemic it is not the first or will it be the last that humans will have to live and die through. If, as appears to be the case, it is very largely those who are weak and infirm either by age or their own abuse of their bodies (overweight) then at some stage the law of the jungle will raise itself and the responsibility to protect will fall back onto individuals and family. How much longer will people accept the controls being put in place when the evidence they see, supported by the statistics, is that they may lose some older grandparents a bit early or people who are already fairly ill or physically unfit and they need motorised chairs to get about, compared to the fact that their livelihood and ability to support their immediate family and whole way of life has been turned upside down."

The UK has relied too heavily on gas from Russia for— guess what, Putin is using his prolific gas reserves to exploit market volatility with a view to increasing geopolitical destabilisation. In the last year, natural gas prices have rocketed by 600%, affecting not only householders but industries producing or utilising CO2 – including food production, health services and hospitals. Russia has been accused of ‘weaponising’ gas supplies by cutting supplies through Ukraine and refusing to replenish European storage sites. What might have been seen as ‘normal’ speculation in the market has become panicked, and this situation is not expected to improve in the foreseeable future – perhaps several years. Energy costs have increased by 25% in the last year; they are widely expected to be at least 50% higher from April. The poorest are likely to have to spend over half their income on energy; and the government is struggling to come up with a political and financial strategy to protect consumers from catastrophic future price rises. It will be no surprise if the banks turn their backs on any overtures to take part in any guarantees schemes that are established in these volatile circumstances. Putin is also accused of preparing to blackmail the EU, and Germany in particular, in relation to the giant Nord Stream 2, a massive Gazprom gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, to supply Russian gas directly to Germany – and onwards in several directions. This has been many years in development, now substantially completed but awaiting vital technical and regulatory authorisations. Needless to say, from the outset, this project has been beset by constant geopolitical difficulties. What else did anyone expect from Russia? Putin is no benevolent uncle . . . . . The world will have to wait to see what he will do if the project is ‘sabotaged’ by European intransigence. There have also been several vital inherent weaknesses within the UK which have exacerbated the problem. Considerable over-optimism about the viability of off-shore winds farms to keep operating; a hopeless reliance on the above-mentioned, but non-existent benevolence; an equally non-existent policy on long-term storage, and a spectacular failure within Ofgem, Britain’s energy regulator. The fluffy mission statement reads: “We work to protect energy consumers, especially vulnerable people, by ensuring they are treated fairly and benefit from a cleaner, greener environment”. H.1541 Male, married, age 77; two adult children; retired film editor & sometime writer; Central Scotland Ofgem has three main responsibilities; [1] working with government, industry and consumer groups to deliver a net-zero economy, at the lowest cost to consumers; [2] stamping out sharp and bad practice, ensuring fair treatment for all consumers, especially the vulnerable; and [3] enabling competition and innovation which drives down prices and results in new products and services for consumers. That last one is the killer; since the end of last August, 28 energy companies have folded – their customers—2.6 million of them—siphoned off around the remaining companies. It was as clear as a bell to me, an average customer still thankfully with his chosen supplier, that Ofgem was blinded to everything else by an over-developed sense of how well they were doing in recruiting dozens of new, small ‘innovators’ to the market. But was there no vetting processes? Business plans? Critical analyses? New young innovators might have survived in some benign circumstances, but this was an international bear market – and a crisis that was developing for many, many months. No-one could have assumed calm waters ahead."

The restrictions that are in place are nowhere near stringent enough for which of course I blame the government because the scientists and the medics are speaking out vociferous today and the government are almost silent. This evening November 26, 2021, Matt Hancock was on the news talking about the new variance in South Africa and yet still no word from the Prime Minister. Our government is corrupt. Let me say that again the present government is corrupt.We seem to be doing well with vaccinations I’m glad to say. Listening last night to the briefing room which is broadcast and headed up by David Aaronovitch were experts in the medical field talking about what is happening in Europe and this is most interesting particularly hearing from people in the governments talking about what's happening within the country so we have a little joined up Ness even though we are now seen to be apart from Europe was still inhabiting the same continent, the politics unravels us, keeps us apart. https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0011s2y Its worth hearing There's no point in bringing out the salient points and you can hear it directly as I urge you to. Booster jabs are going ahead here and the program is being rolled out well whilst in South Africa new variants, spin-offs from the Delta variant, are proliferating and of course we do inhabit the same world as all other countries which are not only not having vaccinations rolling out properly like in South Africa itself but the very idea of boosters is far beyond any meagre programme operating at present. This is one of its worst aspects the seeming separation between nations when the pandemic is in its self something that affects all of us and we are of course one world but would you ever know? I don't want to write about anything that's happening in Parliament regarding Owen Patterson. Nor do I want to write about the lawsuit involving Andrew Duke of York. I am really really sorry about the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Ames, just as I was very sorry about the death, the murder of Jo Cox Labour MP. It's an appalling act when people are trying to do a job to represent their constituents and someone thinks that taking their life is an okay thing to do, it's an appalling thing to do and very sad indeed. I wasn't aware that it was the centenary of the red poppy. I've known various people over the years who have had to do with making them or selling them. I'm glad it continues but I would be very happy to be seeing more white poppies from the peace Pledge Union about the country, ideally we should be wearing both, to represent a commitment to peace and on the other hand commemoration of the dead who are used as Canon fodder. I think I may include a poem here that I have written since anything else came up about the First World War within this forum. I wrote it after an excellent talk on WW1 given by a really good library archivist from a London borough. Jane Marsh drank tea in the military hospital waiting for her grandfather to emerge through the swing doors waiting to catch sight of his remaining compatriots, the friends he’d made whilst on active service most no longer active but skeletons in some mass grave on the soil of the Somme or pinned down in a bed in the other ward for those sick in mind, not locked up, what need? Mostly locked out of their own sensibilities. Her grandfather had many more years, would survive relatively intact, be too old for active service in the next war and be working in the protected trade of steel. It would be many years before Jane started looking at the divisions between men called class which separated the sheep from the men who called the shots, started wars and blithely used her grandfather's class as canon fodder. In the future, further unjust wars would use the poor and the rest in the unjust causes called war. Power sucked the life out of them all. Power enraged and enraptured, cast shadows over all their lives throughout millennia lust for power where often no power exists. She drank her tea. She waited for her grandfather, and the blue of his hospital pyjamas like the vast sky overhead, a look of innocence reflected in her eyes. September 3rd 2021 If commemorating the dead really meant anything the world would be giving up war but there seems little appetite for giving up the power which is at its heart.We will be commemorating those deaths for a long time and the red poppies will keep our memories alive to those tragic events whilst the millions dying still all over the world will be forgotten and new wars will be perpetrated. The white poppy and the cause of peace are sparse in comparison, many will neither have seen them or known them and the cause of peace needs to be espoused further and wider throughout the wide world. And what is the cause of peace? The desire for peace needs to grow stronger than the desire for war and power and those craving power need toter to what is the greater good for all and not just them so defence against them is not needed. December 20th 2021 Omicron is growing ……………………Thats the event of the moment. January 11th 2022 Omicron has grown The government finds itself in deeper corruption than ever with news of their parties, this is how they will end perhaps though it’s amazing what British people put up with. An event that ought to occur is the devolution of other parts of Britain who can perhaps vote for better governments for themselves than the tories who run this country. Joelle Taylor won the TS Elliot prize for poetry last night. It was a really strong group of contenders but/and she really deserved it. Its definitely winter, there is a fuel crisis and my bill has gone up a third but. All bills are due to go up even more. I hope to send this today. January 12 The crisis is the government over the parties during the time of Covid at Number 10. Is growing. The tories turn against each other now ad I very much hope the Prime Minster will resign."

Poppy day has not become a patriotic arms race for politicians. Ostentatious, superficial display seems to have replaced respect for those who served their country. Even the media seems nervous that it may be attacked for lack of respect and TV presenters dare not appear without a clearly displayed poppy for fear of provoking synthetic outrage. More populist style over substance nonsense.4) Sir David Amess. A very sad business. Not my political party but this should never happen.

Masks are no longer compulsory in all shops, schools are (almost) back to normal, and the need to isolate has been cut from 10 days to 5, providing you have 2 negative lateral flow tests. There are still restrictions when travelling to some countries, but on the whole, it has only affected me in as much as I have to do lateral flow tests twice a week.  Throughout the whole pandemic, I have continued to go into work and work out of the office.  I have been very lucky that so far I have not had Covid, though the most recent Omicron variant doesn’t seem to be bad as the previous Delta variant.  I seem to know more people now that have had covid recently, than I did during the first or second wave. Thankfully, no one has been seriously ill, and most report it being similar to flu, but with added tiredness. I had my booster vaccine just before Christmas, having had the previous dose in July.  The timing was cut from 6 months to 5 and then 3 months, and I was able to get an appointment swiftly and easily at our local centre. With regard to rising energy bills, I am aware that myself and my partner M are in a very fortunate position.  Although we don’t earn huge somes ( I had to take a £3000 pay cut to get a job after being made redundant in 2021) we earn enough to cover all our bills.  I also have a very tiny mortgage.  Also, with us both being out at work full time, our energy costs aren’t too high during the working week.  I do feel for those on a limited income or pension.  This rise is going to hit some very hard. The murder of Sir David Amess was particularly shocking as it took place during such a ‘normal’ day. MPs (some more than others!) have always been available for the public to talk too, and turn up and see with any issues. For someone to use this opportunity to attack the very person who does so much for their community, was awful.  I truly hope this doesn’t mean that MPs will have to have security, or be seen from behind a screen, as this goes against what MPs are for.  To see their constituents, and then represent them and their views in parliament. The lawsuit involving Prince Andrew is a tricky one to have a view on, as there has been so much speculation in the press, and so much ‘did he know, or didn’t he’ pontificating, its hard to get to the clear facts.  Unfortunately, its clear that Prince Andrew made some very bad choices when it came to the company he kept, how much he know about the darker side of their behaviour, we will have to wait until the court case -if there is one. I certainly don’t believe he should be exempt from appearing in court simply for being a member of the Royal family.  The law applies to all, regardless of status."

I find Armistice Day very affecting, and usually end up crying in church on Remembrance Sunday. (Did not go this year. See: anxiety.) I find poppy-shaming to be veryfrustrating asI usually don’t bother to actually purchase and wear a poppy, but I always think deeply about all those who have suffered in war ­and especially the young men in WW1 who had such bright futures and such high hopes and ended up slogging through hell and wondering if the lucky ones were the ones who survived or the ones who died."

I’m responding in March 2022. I’ve had my booster jab, and successfully went on a holiday abroad over Christmas, managing to stay Covid negative and going through many, many mandatory tests. The prophecies of winter Covid doom seem not to have come true. I now consider myself “vaccinated and done”. For me, the pandemic is over, and Covid is simply another respiratory virus circulating in the population the same way colds and flu viruses always have. Yes, people will die, and are dying, just like they always have, but excess deaths actually appear to be negative at the moment. We should absolutely still be researching better vaccines, and I live in hope that one day we find a robust vaccine that completely eliminates all coronaviruses. But for now, it’s just another hazard to put on the list of hazards that we must all deal with daily. Besides, we have other demons to deal with: a return to focusing on climate change, and the horrors of a new war in Europe. I now work in the office about two days per month -the rest at home. I’m very happy with this outcome. I see energy as the foundation of all economies. Everything we do needs energy. It is incredibly important to have energy independence, otherwise we are at the mercy of those who will sell it to us. In a perverse optimistic way, I’m glad that energy bills are going up if it means we burn less fossil fuel, and give less money to dictators. I’m not happy with the inflationary consequences of higher energy prices, but I think the answer is to pursue new sources of energy, not to try to hang onto the old ones. I believe the UK should be running full tilt towards an economy based on wind and hydrogen. We have the ideal geography to scale up offshore wind power by multiple orders of magnitude. We have the technology to electrify the industries that can be electrified, and to produce green hydrogen (from electrolysis of water, powered by wind turbines) for those that cannot, and for energy storage to smooth out the intermittency of renewables. This is the only path to energy independence, food independence, and net zero emissions, and it comes with the wonderful side-effect of making the UK a global centre of excellence, and exporter, of clean power technology. Also in the news is Boris Johnson and the long list of parties he didn’t attend and had no knowledge of but if he did attend it was by accident, and he left early, and it was a work event anyway. What a load of nonsense. I genuinely don’t care that he attended a party. I care that he is lying about it. I would actually respect him a lot more if he had simply declared that “people with important jobs” are exempt from social distancing rules. It would lay bare the implicit elitism in play, but at least would have been honest. He is unfit to lead (for this reason, and for other reasons). His party colleagues are spineless for not forcing him out. I voted against the Conservative candidate in a local town council, not because I’m a fan of Labour at all, but because I felt I needed to send a message that it’s time for a reshuffle in parliament. This lot have fallen into sleaze and corruption. Their successors will too (whether Labour or Conservative), but it helps to keep them on their toes. 7"

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Neither my partner nor myself have been unwell over the last ten weeks. Bad hay fever this year might have caused us on occasion to think that we had covid 19 symptoms but you just have to try and stay calm and ask whether this is really any different to normal. The changing advice on symptoms also makes it difficult to know quite what to look out for. For instance, in the last couple of weeks there has been reference to loss of taste – with blocked sinuses from hay fever poor sense of taste is also something I’ve experienced. I think ultimately as an asthmatic I tend to know when I don’t feel quite right, so I have to think that this judgement is sufficient even at the moment. I think at the start we were particularly on the lookout for a high temperature and unusual headache. I would say there was a heightened anxiety for both of us at the start of the “lockdown” period and also leading up to the imposed restrictions, not concerning ourselves but primarily about how we would be able to support both sets of elderly parents, late 80’s, at a distance of 70 miles. Whilst this is still a constant concern, a pattern of ordering food, keeping contact etc has now been established. Initially though these concerns are what caused the greatest anxiety for us both resulting in fatigue, poor sleep, strange dreams and short tempers! I suffer from migraine which ordinarily would have been better controlled with an imposed routine with regular meals, hours and not going far from home, but I experienced a cluster of migraines which it was difficult to shift especially as my sleep was so disrupted. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I’ve had no need to access health care, but I was due to attend a hospital appointment for post surgery physio. This took place over the phone and I was then sent videos of exercises. Because I’d previously had appointments and have seen significant improvement in strength and movement, this was more than acceptable, but I think I would have felt differently earlier in the process where it was critical for a physical examination to assess my needs. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I would say that my emotions feel quite “normal” for me now. At the start of the shutdown though I felt more unsettled. Listening to news items on the radio could cause me to become tearful. Now I feel that my response is of being deeply moved, and then angry that so much of what has gone wrong could have been prevented, for instance if the health service had not been cut to the bare bones. Ordinarily I’m involved in local politics and we would have been out campaigning for the now postponed London GLA and mayoral elections. I’m frustrated that at a local level we don’t have a way of challenging the nationally defined and politically charged messages. Locally there has been a campaign to save out local hospital, and I wonder whether the clap for carers will be transformed into the local electorate realising they have to fight to maintain our service. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? The government continues to say it is guided by the science, but this is meaningless and nonsense. On the face of it, the decisions made appear to contradict the ideology of the current government, especially the economic decisions. Ultimately though the government had to induce a recession to ensure that thee was so little activity that people, if not technically in total lockdown(as was experienced in Italy for instance) believed that they were, in order to curtail people’s activities and thus prevent the infection getting out of control. In the last week the government is now trying to kickstart the economy again. Some people seem willing to go along with this -some because they have no choice to maintain their livelihood, others because they just want to go out. I fear that some think that because they’ve stayed at home that they won’t catch the virus now, and so their resolve to continue social distance has diminished, so potentially the decision to ease lockdown could result in another spike. Perhaps this is deliberate, as politicians such as Iain Duncan Smith show their callousness and brutality when interviewed. He is categorical that there is no choice but to return to work, and he seems to suggest this regardless of the consequent number of lives lost. One decision that was clearly politically motivated was that relating to the funding of Transport for London(Tfl). Numbers using the tube have dropped by (?) 90%, so successful with regard to social distancing and ensuring that key workers can get to work safely, however the resulting loss in revenue has meant that the Labour London Mayor had to seek a £1.6 billion bailout package and the associated conditions will be politically damaging(the mayoral and GLA elections have been postponed a year to May 2021). He will be required to put restrictions on free travel for the over 60’s, increase fares and possibly remove free travel for children. Transport is one of a few areas where the mayor can make decisions for London and this has been taken away from him in a politically way as other European cities have subsidised public transport. A major scandal has been the way in which the government has shown a disregard for the lives of the elderly and the vulnerable. Even before there were any restrictions on daily activity, the public was told that Covid 19 was like a seasonal flu and that anyway it was only the elderly and those with underlying health conditions at risk. The message was that these lives were dispensable and many who fall into these categories were given the implicit message that valuable ventilators would not be used to attempt to save their lives. These groups have been left in a no win situation – those in care homes are still struggling to obtain tests, as are staff, and whilst residents were starting to die in outbreaks in homes, the government continued to say that there wasn’t a problem. People were discharged from hospital to care homes without being tested and consequently were still covid positive and returned still capable of transmitting the virus. The lack of availability of suitable personal protective equipment(PPE) continues, showing scant regard for the lives of workers. Care homes have had to pay inflated prices as the government does not supply them directly. Carers have been unable to get tested, with many so worried about residents and their own families that they have moved into the care homes. There is now evidence that those of BME heritage are at increased risk from the virus and despite this being evident in the disproportionate number of deaths of non-white health and care workers, the government merely announces this as a “risk factor”, with no suggestion as to how BME workers will be protected. Increasingly statistics are rolled out and statements made which fail to show even a pretence of compassion. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Despite what is currently being said, I think that there is likely to be a return to some form of “austerity”. Although it makes no economic sense to think that the debt which is building from, for instance furlough payments, should be paid off, particularly as current low interest rates mean that servicing the debt is low, the Tories will struggle to stop themselves saying that the country can’t afford it. It’s likely that labour laws will be relaxed further and the rights of workers further eroded; possibly the minimum wage will be frozen. However there is a distinct possibility of an L-shaped recession, so if the economy is going to do more than bounce along the floor, the government will have to make decisions about how they can increase aggregate demand. Politically it would be damaging to increase direct taxes for those already in the upper income tax bracket, but if they choose to increase regressive indirect taxes then inequality will worsen. To limit benefits for the unemployed and the low paid will deepen and prolong the recession, but unfortunately I don’t trust this government not to do this. They might consider a hypothecated tax, from income tax or more likely national insurance, but in reality any of these measures will merely give the illusion that they are attempting to “bring the deficit down”. There have been numerous comparisons with the 2008 crash. This morning I heard George Osborne interviewed and he made statements such as “the country will be poorer” suggesting that we are yet again being prepared for significant public sector service cuts, benefit freezes and stricter eligibility criteria for benefits, as the government will want to quickly withdraw from the government ownership, payment of wages and nationalisation that has taken place. They will argue that state control will stifle enterprise, that the country can’s afford the debt etc etc. The sectors now centrally organised will be returned to the private sector in the guise of dealing with the debt, when in reality hedge funds and financiers will be given the chance to purchase equity at significantly reduced prices. Unfortunately, rather than saying this is a global downturn, the government will go out of its way to hold its ideological ground and “bribe” (for instance with further deregulation of the labour market) those already with wealth and resources at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly. The project to conclude the privatisation of the NHS will be hastened, as we are told that it is unsustainable to run at a “loss” a hospital/GP practice/community services/ social care etc. The Thursday “clap” for carers is a useful distraction to mark the passing of another week and stops serious questioning about the underfunding and privatisation of the service which has resulted in health, care and other workers dying because they went to work and were not given the correct equipment, facilities or testing which might have saved their lives. This week the government, after much pressure from its own back benchers, to allow those workers in health and care who are defined as “migrants”, to access health care without paying the surcharge. Not only have the logistics yet to be arranged, but the surcharge is to be increased to over £600 a month in October, and sadly I suspect those workers will then be told they have to pay the charge yet again. Footnote: this weekend the story has broken about Dominic Cummings breaking the lockdown in April to travel with his family from London to his parental home in Durham. With announcements due this week about possible relaxation in rules the media and government have become preoccupied with this story. My main concern is how this will now affect guidelines in the coming weeks. People are angry, upset and showing a loss of confidence in the “leadership”, and there’s much talk of “one rule for us, and one for them”. Generally people will comply with restrictions on their lives if they perceive they are not being singled out and victimised, and this story completely destroys this tenuous bond of trust. A sense of equity has been, and is, pivotal to such a high adherence to the “lockdown” measures News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I tend to listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 for a couple of hours from its start at 6am to catch up on any developments from the previous day and for international news especially anything that has broken in the US. I briefly read the Guardian online, but not every morning and then the next regular source is the Channel 4 news in the evening. Occasionally I’ll catch the 10 o’clock news and/or Newsnight, but won’t stick with either it feels like mere repetition, or just too much of a platform for the government’s message. I made the decision very early not to keep track of rolling news as it could have been too overwhelming. I’m also concerned about being led to believe something because it fits with the message of the day, particularly by the use of photos, so I prefer to let the news “mature” and allow myself time to reflect. I’m aware that this is at odds with rolling news and constant drip feeds and chitter chatter from social media. I’m especially impressed by the reports that Victoria Mcdonald presents on Channel 4. I will sometimes dip into twitter to see but I don’t tweet. I have no alerts on my phone so am not constantly scrolling. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I watched them in the first week, and now sometimes dip into a live audio broadcast. If there is a specific set of policies that are to be announced then I’m more likely to listen, specifically if the chancellor is speaking. On the whole they appear to be a front for the message of the day, and by having a member of the cabinet standing between “2 scientists” there’s an attempt at creating an (unconvincing) illusion of science guided policy which is beyond politics. The broadcasts have become less palatable to watch as it is so clear when the front politician is lying. So many mistakes have been made and so many deadlines missed that it is astounding that they continue to sound so emphatic. Questions are on the whole inadequately answered and when pushed if something will take place(for instance testing in care homes) the words used are carefully chosen – “an aspiration” or “tests are available” Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? This has not touched me personally, but I remember mentioning to my partner that in one news bulletin Bolsanaro had someone signing, and wondering why the UK government didn’t especially as the Welsh and Scottish briefings do have interpreters. The response from the UK government a couple of weeks ago was that they were looking into this(what was there to look into?) but nothing has changed, which is unacceptable and says something truly disturbing and yet unsurprising about the attitude of those in charge. Accessibility is still seen a luxury which is an insult to all those affected. The lack of BSL signers is unfortunately just one example of the problems many are experiencing– ASD, those with mental health issues, those with learning difficulties, the visually impaired, elderly carers and so on. Information was also not circulated in braille, and I know from local media that a couple who are visually impaired didn’t know what they should do as they had not seen the government’s advice, and consequently one of them died as he didn’t get to hospital on time. The elderly mother of a friend has had some problems specifically at the start. She is severely visually impaired, lives on her own, and is in her 90’s. He has been arranging Sainsbury’s deliveries for her for several years mow but he was suddenly unable to do so as she isn’t considered vulnerable according to government criteria. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I’m not in paid employment so I’ve no immediate direct personal experience of this. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My partner and I are very fortunate as neither of us is in paid employment and we have no school aged children. We are fortunate to have a garden and 2 separate downstairs rooms so we are able to escape from eachother if we need to! Pre pandemic we chose to spend our days together so we haven’t been forced into an unfamiliar situation. We have many shared interests and with the benefit of the internet it’s possible to pursue these ad infinitum. Having said that, we are also both self sufficient and equally happy to spend time apart even if the distance is only by being in separate rooms. Usually we spend a lot of time exploring and doing things in London, getting around by public transport and on foot. We still walk a lot, but the focus is on exercise rather than exploring, although in the last week we’ve researched and explored a couple of local (hidden and unmarked) archeological sites. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? This hasn’t arisen, I suspect primarily because there has been no driving force from the workplace which previous experience suggests is where the impetus tends to come from eg my introduction to email many years ago was at work where I used it before using it at home. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? Keeping in touch regularly has been with family, and friends without work commitments. I’ve not used any new methods to keep contact(and would not use Zoom anyway) tending to stick with the method that I’ve always used with different people. It has made me realise that I do keep in touch with different people in different ways – phone, text/sms, email and WhatsApp. We have a WhatsApp group of 4 close family members, and then I only use it for 2 of my closest friends – curiously one who lives very close by, and another who moved away from the UK a couple of years ago. If so, what has this been like? It’s made me realise that I use WhatsApp for a chat with people I’m close to. I also like the ability to share, especially photos, with ease. I don’t post on any platforms, although I lurk, as I don’t feel the need to be “out there” and so WhattsApp provides a more managed intimate way of keeping contact, mainly because of who I communicate with rather than the nature of the App. I’ve always felt that WhattsApp groups which to date I’ve resisted joining can be intrusive and overwhelming. Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I checked in on a few people at the start – friends who by the nature of friendship and how it changes over time are people I care about and have known a long time, but our paths cross infrequently. To keep more regular contact now seems an intrusion and would change the dynamic – one friend has returned to healthcare and although I think of him we don’t ordinarily communicate frequently. We had a text conversation when it was announced that retired GPs were being “invited” to return, but since then I’ve held back from getting in touch again as I don’t want him to feel he needs to keep “checking in”. It can be a challenge sometimes just making such regular contact with elderly parents especially when no one has done anything and remaining sympathetic to their situation. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I don’t post on any and am not a FB lurker. I will however, a I always have done, lurk on Twitter looking at the accounts of people who I’ve always dipped into to find different sources of information and reading via links. I have started reading a countrywide community forum as escapism – nothing quite beats spending 10 minutes whilst the pasta is cooking reading a thread called “what’s for tea tonight?”. I’ve always been fascinated by people who prodigiously post anywhere, especially when they start to reveal things about themselves – just as I’m doing here! Perhaps we all need to express ourselves somewhere where we feel comfortable and I like the fact I have a MOA number not a name! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I’ve not been into a shop since lockdown, and although I did occasionally think about popping out to get something, such thoughts are occurring less and less. I started online shopping about 15 years ago, and although I do it less frequently now it wasn’t a huge change for me to arrange this to enable a degree of self isolation. However getting delivery slots for the first few weeks was a challenge and almost became a full time job, at least a preoccupation(and the fuel for a dream/nightmare), especially trying to arrange deliveries for elderly parents and in laws who don’t shop online. We now have a good routine of weekly fruit and veg boxes and a supermarket delivery every couple of weeks, so that I can also order food for a couple of people who are self isolating. I’ve used a breadmaker anyway for 15 years or so, so made sure I had plenty of flour. I’m using the breadmaker more to make dough and then shape prove and bake and cook in the oven because I’m around to do so. It’s enjoyable, the bread is tasty and I’m trying different types. We’re here everyday so dinner is at home and always cooked from scratch. We normallykeep easy food eg a ready meal/pizza, in the freezer for when we go out for the day, or for a quick meal before an evening meeting, but we don’t need to now. I’m cooking a greater variety of meals and looking at recipes – I’ve got the time and I don’t want to waste any food especially from the fruit and veg boxes. I would also say I’m taking more care storing food and keeping the windowsill herbs alive! Because of a shortage of yeast sourdough had its moment which I indulged in. Although the results have been delicious I’m not baking it regularly. I put a starter into hibernation in the freezer a month or so a go and retrieved it yesterday and started feeding it again, so maybe another loaf in a week or so. It seems to be waking up!! Initially the first supermarket delivery was for 4 households which we then delivered – quite an organisational feat. I’ve a couple of friends who can get slots now, and we all check-in with eachother when we have a slot and order items for eachother. My son has worked throughout as a key worker and so I’ve organised deliveries to go there(50 miles away) He is a carer as well so it just didn’t seem right that he should work and then have to queue at the supermarket – the shopping trips having to be frequent as he has no car. Afterthought 28 May 2020 I’m starting to think that the feelings that I had about being thrust into the role of domestic manager are more than just niggles. We’re already seeing that it’s women in the workplace who are more likely to be made redundant but there are signs that there is an increasing burden on women for effective household management. I’ve been considering conversations that I’ve had with friends, all women in conventional stable opposite sex marriages or partnerships. These women are in their 20’s, 40’s, 50’s, 70’s and 80’s. All but the youngest are mothers, and whilst being(or have been) in what would bee considered “professional” jobs, have tended to move more frequently between workplaces and with various mixes of part and full time paid work. Even with adult children it seems that mothers are providing support in for instance getting food. I think the initial shortages and the desire not to enter shops meant we were all furiously organising and planning. It seems to becoming a burden, but maybe it’s just that we’re stuck at home with no escape from partners? There was also a lot of early lockdown house cleaning and tidying by people generally. I woildn’t say that my friends are particularly houses proud, but because this is also linked with hand washing, disinfecting and trying to ensure surfaces are virus free this also seems to be something that’s managed by women. Including ensuring that sufficient cleaning products are in the house. I’m certainly wiping surfaces more frequently than usual(maybe because I’m here) and cleaning the bathroom everyday. It’s drudge so why am I doing it? I need to think more about this and see how it plays out, but I’m getting a sense that women are certainly dealing with increased drudgery, and also that fatal combination of responsibility and some bitterness. A friend said she’d had a “robust conversation” with her husband when we were discussing that “the men” seem to dip into cooking when it suits and don’t take into account that it’s one meal of many in the week when choosing ingredients. Also the default is that we will cook. I’ve much more to say on this but maybe I need to reflect first! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? There was a great flurry at the start of lockdown with people proselytizing about all the life changing achievements we were going to make. I was very sceptical from the start and it seemed it was just a way to generate copy for “lifestyle” pages and gave an opportunity for endless youtube videos. It seemed like some people just couldn’t cope without being governed by the language of scientific management and the need for targets. I also keep thinking that many of these so called projects are merely ways of encouraging people to continue to spend money. We’ve done some sorting and tidying of things that have been niggling for a while, and found cobwebs which normally I wouldn’t bother seeing. The list of thing that we could do around the house has not greatly shortened, but given a free choice I would prefer to read or bake. We walk at least 3 – 4 miles everyday, which is not unusual, and further on other days. I can only think of a handful of days since the restrictions when we’ve not gone for a walk. With the roads so much quieter it’s also felt safer to cycle, which is something that we only normally do when on holiday. I usually swim, but haven’t done so this winter because of surgery, so that wasn’t too much of a shock, although now the weather is nice I do most days think about the joys of sea swimming, which is very important to me over the summer months when we go away for extended periods in our campervan. Oh, and I suppose there’s all the dancing in the kitchen to the music turned up loud whilst cooking and baking. I’ve also been able to be very conscientious about my post operative physio and turned it into a 40 minute workout every other day, with 15 minutes of stretches on alternate days. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I always have a book on the go anyway, but tend to read shorter books so they’re easily thrown into my rucksack, and not too heavy! When the weather has been nice, and as we’re not going out, I’m reading more than usual in the garden(a bit like being on holiday), so I’ve just finished Thomas Mann’s “Buddenbrooks”. It is a hardback, long and heavy, so I’ve been waiting to take it on holiday, but now it will be one of my reading memories of the sunny lockdown spring. I have got more time to read and I think my head must be less cluttered as usual I’m tending to have fiction and non­fiction on the go at the same time, yet m also feel less hurried reading and able to think more deeply about the non fiction whilst still immersing myself in the world that I’m living in through the novels. I’ve watched the first 2 series of “The Wire”, rationed not binged(!), and I’m looking forward to the next one, again not something I would normally commit to. Apart from the news I’ve watched little TV but that’s not unusual. In the early weeks when the evenings were still getting dark earlier, “Bakeoff” and similar light programmes might be on in the background whilst I read the paper online. We usually go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema and also attend public lectures, so at the start thee was an element of “we should have been going to….”. I’ve perhaps listened to more podcasts as a result and we’ve watched a couple of plays online, but neither are substitutes for shared, live events. Podcasts are just different but familiar anyway, whereas I do struggle with watching a play on a small domestic screen, and it’s made me realise how you make your own experience of a play by where you choose to look, whereas the camera does that for you with a broadcast. The result is it takes me much longer to get involved and I’m not convinced I can suspend my disbelief as easily, but having said that, after an initial non plussed 30 minutes, the performance of “A Streetcar named Desire” that we watched last night was totally absorbing. I listen to a variety of podcasts depending on my mood and time from the lightweight (e.g. Fortunately) to the more informative (e.g. Talking Politics, with David Runciman). I can’t abide radio phone ins! The only music radio we have on is Radio 6, as usual, but more of it as I’m at home more and it also provides an automatic disco to dance to whilst cooking. Music is also something my partner and I share – discussing and listening, and hunting out youtube clips. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? The most obvious change is the focus on hand-washing – both frequency and duration – and the resulting need for hand cream. When the weather was still cold I did have an eczema flare up on my hands which was really the only time that hand-washing was painful, and I suppose normally I would have avoided putting my hands in water so frequently. There’s been no significant change, although I’ve noticed that not going on public transport means that clothes don’t get as dirty and there’s not the griminess on the skin which happens when travelling on the tube. The main impact for me, as for everyone, is the inability to get my hair cut. I’d had an appointment booked for March 23, so I’ve not had a cut since 10 Feb. I’m not at all worried about my appearance, but as someone with very thick, short hair it’s uncomfortable in the warm weather, and it’s very obvious that I need a cut. Apart form daily exercise I don’t leave the house/garden I simply use hair grips to hold it back out of my eyes-not exactly flattering but hey The overriding anxiety at the thought of someone cutting my hair is a useful distraction when I wonder which way to try and push my heavy fringe – 4 July is being mooted as a possible date for hairdressers to open, but I won’t be first in the queue. It’s only just struck me that I’ve gone into winter mode for leg shaving – ie not at all! Need to think about that one. Perhaps as we’ve all become a bit more inward looking and isolated it shows just how much pressure there is to have smooth legs, and without social interaction it’s somet"

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health My health is good, as is that of my partner. Although, as someone who is taking immunosuppressants for a health condition, he is not allowed out or to meet people for at least 12 weeks, and I am supposed to keep a distance from him too. But we are in good physical and mental health. We are not naturally pessimistic people, and make sure that we get as many facts as possible before coming to any conclusions, so we keep up to date with the news, and don’t get too down with it. In fact, my own interest in modelling means I am very interested in the rate of infection, the death rate, and so on, so that I can see ahead. I know it’s a gloomy prediction, but I am still happier being able to look at the facts myself. I have not had any paid work for over 6 months now, and my partner’s work has also dried up, so we are a little nervous about when and if we will get work again. With last year’s tax to pay off, a mortgage which still has a few years to run, and gloomy business and economy prospects, I am a little on edge about our finances. I am managing to cope by taking payment holidays, but it’s a problem. It’s also compounded by the fact that my self-employed situation means I don’t get any support from the government, and my partner’s self-employment situation means he is assessed for support on the year before last, during which he earned almost nothing, so gets 80% of almost nothing = nothing at all. Worrying. But we are keeping positive, and also supporting some friends who are more affected emotionally by it all. The Government I am frankly appalled by the decisions and strategy that the UK government has taken. (sorry, I didn’t mean to leave the text in bold, but actually it is how I feel!) We keep up with the news from around the world, and in particular Ireland, as we have family and a house there, so can easily compare what different countries are doing. The response, planning and strategy in other countries has been far, far better than in the UK. I cringe every time I hear Boris Johnson say that we are doing really well, are successful, and it’s all under control. Plus, the daily briefings are lamentable – a host of ministers who haven’t got a clue mumbling on instead of giving us facts that mean something. I worry about the current strategy – saying that people should return to work if they can, but without giving firms the right equipment, support and guidance. I really fear another spike in infections and deaths. The news last night was that the actual death rate is more like 50,000 instead of the 31,000 reported as deaths where a person was tested for the virus. With the current back-to-work strategy and noticing people’s response and behaviour in the past couple of weeks, I fear that we will end up with more than 100,000 deaths by this time next year, a crippled economy from having to continually start-stop, and millions of hours of wasted time while the luckier people get sick and slowly recover. Plus massive unemployment due to firms having to lay people off. In terms of what steps I think the Government will take, I haven’t a clue. I hope that they listen to other countries, scientists and public health experts, but they don’t seem to be doing so. News I start the morning with reading all the headlines on BBC news on my phone, and then dip into it several times a day – perhaps 10 or so. I might listen to a news-on-the-hour on BBC Radio 4 if I already have the radio on while cooking, and also the RTE (Irish) news at 8pm on digital radio. Most evenings I watch the BBC 10 o’clock news on TV before going to bed, and 2-3 times a week some of Newsnight. We tend to stop for tea around 4:30 or 5pm, and I used to tune into the radio broadcast of the press conference, but I have grown tired of the platitudes and meaningless statements, so instead head for the ONS or other government website for an update on the numbers. The 5pm briefing is getting more and more ridiculous, and the 7pm broadcasts from Boris last weekend highly farcical. However, I enjoy watching the Facebook memes that apply different voices to the video, or satirical takes on the words being used in the briefings. I am not aware of anyone who has access difficulties, but every time I see Nicola Sturgeon check behind her to ensure that her sign interpreter is ready to commence, I feel proud of the way that the Scottish First Minister understands the value of truth, plain speaking and honesty, as well as the fact that she is part of a team, not a hero. Work and home life My partner and I are self-employed, so work at home anyway. Neither of us has had any proper work for around 6 months or more, but we are both trying to get work. I have teamed up with another small network of people to address the virtual meetings/conferences market,basedonwhatweusedtodotogetherbefore. It’s beginningtogetsometraction,butsadlynothing for me yet in terms of income. There are one or two projects that have been postponed from physical meetings, and we are trying to reconfigure them for virtual sessions, and when (and if) they happen, I may then begin to relax a bit in the knowledge that business will pick up again. But it’s worrying times. Neither of us can be furloughed as we are self-employed. Neither of us is getting any state support for our work, although I did sign on for Universal Income, which has made a small difference. It’s less than 1/10th of my previous income, and doesn’t cover the mortgage, the balance on the car loan and my credit card debt as we entered the lockdown, but with payment holidays we have a little bit of breathing space. Home life hasn’t been affected – we don’t have kids, so no home-schooling, although people who I work with have commitments that means that some projects are slow to mobilise because they have divided responsibilities. Working from home and (sadly) not having pressing work deadlines means that we can spend some time in the garden, which has been good while the weather was good. Our relationship is not affected apart from both being a little depressed by the lack of income and bleak prospects for now. However, we used to go out a lot, both the theatre/cinema/galleries and to eat out, so we are missing all that. Instead we are Zooming and What’sapping friends and family, and continuing to eat really well (my partner is a really good cook and baker.) Technology We work from home, so are used to staring at a screen to get things done. I have bene using video-conference technology in a limited way for a few years, but it has developed massively in that time. Because of the business I’m in (facilitating strategy and development with groups of people) I have developed my use of Zoom, Teams, and whiteboard apps massively, and have developed some products/services for companies to help them run effective meetings and conferences. While this is just beginningtotakeoff,it’s earlydays,butpeopleseemkeenonwhat we are developing. It will either explode or people will realise that they can do it themselves, without the need for specialists. I thank good sense and foresight for the quality of our broadband – we upgraded a while ago and we really need the extra speed! We use all the apps – FaceTime, Zoom (a LOT), WhatsApp and Houseparty to connect with friends and family. If anything, we are reaching out to people a little more now – we used to rely on going to things like the theatre together, but now we hook up with cocktails and snacks in hand. One observation, though: it’s great to see people, but the chat is banter, not really as deep as a one-to-one on the phone, where you really get to hear how someone is feeling and thinking. Video doesn’t really do emotional reactions. I use Facebook to keep up with friends, but strangely I refer to it less often than I used to. Not sure why – couldbethevolumeofmessagesandthewallofsocialnoise. Maybeit’sbecausepeoplearen’tdoingreally very interesting and novel things, so it’s all a bit same-y. Hmmm… not sure I don’t use twitter much, and Insta not at all, but my partner is a very big user (and is followed a lot) on Instagram, so I get second-hand posts when they are of interest. Shopping and food Online ordering has been a major struggle but is getting better. We have used Ocado for years, and that used to be the main shop each week. However, we found firstly it was almost impossible getting a slot, and then lots of things that were missing like flour and sugar. I am sheltering my partner (he’s on the vulnerable list) so I have been trying to go to the shops as little as possible in order to minimise the risk of bringing an infection back to the house, but it is inevitable that I have to do some shopping locally. That hasn’t been much of a problem, but queuing to get into M&S Food is a novelty. So is wearing gloves and now a face mask when shopping. Not a problem, apart from having to deal with lots of other people who don’t seem to be distancing or protecting others from the risk of infection – there are some gross idiots about who don’t or can’t understand the health risks and real community infection threat. Wefinallygotmypartnerontothecritical list,soTesco’snowoffershimapriority slot, and Ocado now gives me a priority slot each week, so we are managing to get orders. We have also found local wholesalers who have switched to domestic ordering and delivery, which is good. We are foodies, and love to cook – my partner especially –so we tend to shop and eat very well indeed. We bake all our own bread (have done so for a very long time) but getting bread flour has been a real struggle. Our grocery bill used to be around £350 a month and eating out £600-800. Now the grocery bill is £700­odd! We are also drinking a lot more wine, but that probably balances out with the reduction in bar bills when out before. We area also making cocktails for Zoom chats whereas we would have met in a bar somewhere. The lack of exercise, good food and wine has meant that we are now not very fit, but happy! Entertainment and Leisure We haven’t taken up any new hobbies – being self-employed means that I have to focus on trying to get work until it’s time to stop and cook or eat. However, we are at last managing to get to the back of the garden at weekends, a place that was abandoned a few years ago during a home extension project, and we are clearing, weeding, sorting and rebuilding – especially since the weather in April has been exceptionally good. It feels good to be sorting out things, and beingpositive. Lotstodo,buthopefullywewillgetthetimetogetitallsorted. I’malsomanagingtoaddress some DIY jobs that haven’t been done over the past few months, which is good. Also, having to lay off our cleaner means that we are spending several hours every fortnight cleaning, which is hard work but we are combining that with spring cleaning the areas that the cleaner never had time or inclination to do, so some top shelves in the kitchen and space under the bed are getting a proper clean, which feels good. You really appreciate how hard and tiring the work is, and the reliance on professionals! Our watching and listening habits haven’t changed much, but we have been watching series like Money Heist, a Spanish thriller, and Killing Eve. We are watching a few things that we would have gone to see, like 5x15, a monthly series of interesting talks, and a couple of music recitals that we would have gone to see. Not an enormous change, although I do feel that the world is awash with events that are now virtual, and it makes it difficult to choose which ones to watch. Wearen’twatching,listeningorreadinganythingparticularlyrelevanttotheCovidperiod,butwe didwatch Chernobyl at the start of the lockdown, which was really good. Personal hygiene There has been practically no change to personal hygiene for either of us. Just 2 differences: - I now spend more time trying to tame my hair: it used to be cut quite short every 4 weeks, and now  it’s wavy/curly, unruly and 6 weeks overdue a cut  - My consumption of aftershave has dropped to nil, as we don’t go out  Sleep My sleep has only been affected in one way: because we are eating very well, and I am not getting any exercise (I used to just walk hard and fast everywhere – no other exercise) when I go to bed I end up with indigestion and discomfort most nights. But I am sleeping well despite this and no difficulty at all in getting off to sleep or waking with anxiety. If anything, the lack of work means that some mornings I sleep 8 hours, which is a lot for me, so I am managing to half-wake and see my dreams (no, I can’t recall any now). I still go to bed around 11:30 every night, and get up between 6 and 7:30 am. No nightmares, but I sometimes wake thinking about work pressures or potential client situations."

Indeed my daily life and routine have definitely changed beginning with the lockdown when I only went out of the house each day for exercise and to pick up the paper, that was the extent.  Compare this to pre lockdown, when I was out and about all the time, rushing from one place to another and always trying to find some spare time.  So how would I cope with all this spare time, well amazingly well which really surprised me.  Ofcourse the weather was glorious in the lockdown which was a huge benefit, as for the first time I was able to spend time in the garden and the allotment, something I really enjoyed and needless to say the garden and allotment benefitted.  I could no longer go to the gym or swim but I needed exercise, although I previously did cycle a couple of times a week.  However I had to get into a new routine, so ended up cycling 4 times a week and jogging 3 times a week, I love cycling but not keen on jogging.  I went out first thing in the morning around 6.30 and it was lovely, very few people around and they ended up becoming regulars. I would then pop into our local Spar en route home and pick up the paper wearing gloves but no mask.  Big change here as I needed to pop the outer pages of the paper in the microwave to disinfect it, not sure whether this was correct but seemed like a good idea.  At 10 am we would stop whatever we were doing and have a coffee and read the paper; here again so different from before, when I was lucky if I had time to read the paper when having a coffee.  At 11am my husband would go for a walk as he needed some exercise and it gave me the opportunity to get onto the computer and keep up with any admin I needed to do.  At 12 we would have lunch and then around 2 would head to the allotment for an hour, back home for cup of tea, make supper, and then watch TV.    We did see our neighbours from a distance and would chat to them and then we started Facetiming our family and then Zoom became part of our lives.  At the time of lockdown I was President of our local Inner Wheel Club and I decided that if we couldn’t see each other face to face, we needed to see each other virtually.  I had never used or in fact heard of Zoom but I soon learnt how to use it and got a regular weekly session going.  It was lovely to see ladies, who up until then had not really used their computers/tablets/phones for anything like this, really get into it and enjoy it.  As well as doing a weekly Zoom meeting, I also started a weekly newsletter to all the ladies telling them what I was doing, what was going on and asking them to reply stating what they were doing to pass the time.   I feel I got to know some of them a lot better during this time and was actually quite sad when with the end of my year as President in mid July I no longer did this.  As my husband and I are both retired we obviously were not involved in the furlough scheme, however 2 of our grandchildren were, and 1 still is I am sorry to say, but hoping that this will end in September, he needs to be back at work.   We live by the sea, in a very popular area for visitors, and the road outside our house can get very noisy during the summer season.  We both loved the fact that there were no cars on the road, the quiet was heavenly, we could hear the birds singing.  So then lockdown was eased and everything changed.  People started arriving, roads got busy and the harbour was packed and our lives started changing again.  However certainly not back to normal and in some ways this is harder, as people seem to want to push the boundaries of what you can/cant do and yet the virus is still here.  It has been lovely of course to see our family who we have missed, and we have had some friends over but certainly nothing like before and we are both reluctant to go any further.   I have now gone back to the gym twice a week but here again very early, and with the restrictions operating for gyms, currently there are usually only 6-7 people, so feel comfortable with that. We have to pre book our sessions which last 75 minutes, but having to clean all the equipment each time you use it, means that the 75 minutes go by quickly.  In addition our gym is now in 3 seperate areas which adds to the time. In addition we have started netball training, all within a 2 metre square which is kind of weird but better than nothing. Lovely to be able to go to the hairdressers and beautician, and for my husband to be able to play golf and get some more exercise.  We still haven’t been out to a restaurant.  We have taken day trips out to a number of National Trust properties and have enjoyed a change of scenery, but when you live in such a beautiful area it is not so important.  Here again you have to pre book your entry time to the NT grounds, but we haven’t found this too much of a problem.  Homelife There are just the two of us in the household, and I think I have already described how we have spent our time during and coming out of lockdown.  I definitely enjoy having more time to myself and wonder how I am going to cope, if and when they get a vaccine, and we can get back to more normality. I miss being able to go out for lunch with friends and also my husband, being able to do things on the spur of the moment, everything now has to be planned in advance.  Media & technology Certainly for me technology has been great, I did use it a lot prior to Covid so was well versed in its uses, but the extra time I had meant that I was prepared to try and learn more of what I could do.  As I said Zoom probably was the biggest change for me and something that I think will continue to feature in our lives.  I think that the way that we used our medical services will definitely benefit by more use of technology.  I am more than happy to have an initial consult either by phone or virtually, and in fact had one during June which so impressed me because I got to speak to a consultant within 2 weeks, whereas normally I would have to wait anywhere between 2-3 months if I was lucky! Obviously this would not always be the case, but if the initial consult could be done like this, then it would allow Drs hopefully more time with patients.   I have used online shopping for many years, mainly as I am not keen on grocery shopping at the best of times, and also we only have 1 big supermarket close by which I am not keen on.  Due to the initial problems with getting a delivery slot, I started using another company which is more expensive but had the slots.  Once things settled down a bit, my regular supermarket then had slots and so I now alternate between the 2.  I have been considering going back to my regular deliveries every 2 weeks, but who knows if we will have another lockdown and I don’t want to be prevented from getting my slot. We did invest in a Smart TV in January this year, so this has proved a real bonus as we were then able to sign up to Amazon Prime and Netflix, so we have had many programmes to choose from.  Waiting Yes to a certain extent I do feel my life has been put on hold, and I felt I have missed out on our great granddaughter growing up. She is 21 months now and has changed so much during this spell, and I feel she also has missed out on so much as well.  Fortunately we Facetime our granddaughter so were able to see the little one running around, and in fact our great granddaughter Facetimed me the other day by herself!!!  Obviously as we are getting older, we wanted to do some more travelling particularly as we no longer have a dog.   What has amazed us both is just how the time goes by and it seems it is the weekend again.  At this point I will add that we have not changed our drinking habits during Lockdown, we only drink Friday, Saturday & Sunday in the evenings.  However we do treat ourselves to some bubbly once a fortnight, but apart from that no change.  Even now I rarely go into town, so haven’t had to queue that much.  I think the worst experience I had was early on, when our pharmacy was inundated and people were waiting 5-6 hours just to get their prescription.  I did go down at 6.45 in the morning to queue for my husband’s prescription, he took my place at 8.30, the pharmacy did not open till 9, and got his prescription at 9.30.  At that point we decided to change from this pharmacy and we went online to get ours delivered to the house.  Once this was set up it has been great and we certainly will not be going back to having to pick up a perscription. I am fine with waiting to go into a shop as the weather is nice, but wonder how we will all cope in the winter.  One of the other reasons for not going into town, is that I am not keen on having to wear a mask purely because I wear glasses, and although I have tried a number of different options, my glasses seem to mist up. I prefer to do things online.   Fortunately neither of us have had major problems with health, couple of times we have used the online system and it has worked well for us, but I know that this is not the case for everyone.  In our area we have have very low rates of Covid so we have been lucky.  Other things that have changed  There are a number of things that have changed that I wanted to flag up, although I couldn’t really find a section to put them in but felt they were important to note. Firstly in those weeks of lockdown, we didn’t use our cars, we only went to the allotment so needless to say we still had petrol/diesel in our cars when lockdown was over and of course during lockdown the price of oil slumped!! Cash virtually became extinct, my husband to this day, still has £30 in his wallet that he had on March 23rd nearly 5 months ago because we have gone contactless.  We had been gradually using less cash for quite a while, but now it became the normal way to go. They did up the limit from £30 to £45 which helped.  Mind you it does seem strange to use an app to pay £0.40 for an hour’s car parking!  Previously we would buy a year’s car parking permit but no point as I probably only use the car parks twice a week and sometimes my husband doesn’t use them at all. One of the major downsides of this virus has been our church closed and is still not open.  The church is one of 6 in the team, and due to ours being located in the centre of a busy tourist area, it was felt it would be difficult to open once permission had been given. The need to keep numbers coming in for private prayer down, and the fact that you would need at least 2 people in attendance was going to be hard.  In addition the church had said that anyone over 70 could not do this job and as our congregation are 95% over 70 this was impractical.  So our church was designated as the funeral church, meaning that all funerals over the 6 churches in the team would be held here, and the funeral directors had agreed to clean the areas used after the service.  Fortunately to date we have only had 2 funerals. However we have had an online service each week, and although the team now has a service at one of the churches, as only 35 people can attend, the online service continues.  Its not the same but at least it helps. Prior to the virus, we had all been working hard to cut down on the use of plastics in all forms but particularly plastic bags and we were getting very good at it, of course helped by the fact that you now had to pay for them in shops.  Most people had long life bags which they took with them to the supermarkets etc.  However with online deliveries once again we have gone back to plastic bags which I hate, but apparently this is the only way that supermarkets can safely deliver your shopping.  I am every hopeful that an alternative can be found.   People during this time seemed to have become more caring of others, willing to do more for others whoever they are.  I think the weekly clapping for the NHS was amazing, this was one way that anyone could show that they cared. I trust that we do not loose this. As many people started working from home, and in fact continue to do so, it was reported that a lot of them would stay all day in their pyjamas, or else dress in tee shirts and joggers, occasionally putting on a shirt or blouse if they were having an office Zoom meeting.  I can honestly say that I did not change what I wore any different from what I would normally do and I would put my make up on every day regardless of not going out. I have missed wearing a lot of my clothes as I haven’t gone anywhere to wear them, I wonder how many other women did the same."

Or anyone I live with. The only emotion I have experienced is frustration at not being able to get my hair or nails done or go to a coffee shop. The Government I think they have left a lot of things too late like allowing people to fly in from other countries, and not making sure that there was enough PPE for hospital staff, and carer's. I think in the next few weeks they will start to allow more retail premises to open. News I have not watched any of the Government daily broadcasts. I read the news online ( BBC News Daily Newspapers) I have not had any challenges with watching the news,and I was not aware of the petition regarding sign language, But I think it would be a good idea to have a news programme with this in it. Work and home life As my work is casual in the film/TV industry as is my husbands as well it means we have not been able to work at all. We do not qualify for any Government help so we are living off our savings, and my pension. Other than money everything has been fine no arguments or any discord. Because we don't work full time we are used to spending a lot of time together. Technology I have Zoom on my laptop and face time on my phone but never use either even before the pandemic I don't have any family, and friends tend to use text messaging/What's app/Facebook messenger to keep in touch. Or the landline. I have been getting more funny videos through What's app in the past couple of months though. I am quite experienced with technology so it's not a problem for me. I only use Facebook, a couple of times a day which hasn't changed. Most of my friends are on it so if we want to get in touch we use messenger. Shopping and Food I have been food shopping a bit less than normal as I hate all the queuing to get in to the supermarket so I try and buy enough food for 2/3 days when I go..In the beginning a lot of things that I usually buy like tinned soup,bread ,savoury crackers were out of stock but I just went to different shops, and bought different brands. I buy recycled toilet by the case online which lasts about 10 months so I never had to panic buy any. Entertainment and Leisure I have been doing a bit of gardening,cutting things back and planting flowers in pots. The rest of the time I play word games online on my iPhone and do paid surveys online some of which pay me via paypal, and others in shopping vouchers I.E. Amazon. My husband plays games on his play station so it suits both of us. Personal Hygiene My personal hygiene has changed in as much as I am not showering as often as I would normally due to not going out as much, I also don't bother to put any make up on especially if I am just going to the park to walk the dog. But I do still take care of my skin and always moisturise night and day. Sleep I have not had had any problems with my sleep."

The NHS have done a brilliant job treating those in hospital & jabbing everyone. As for lockdowns - we did not know at the beginning of the pandemic the problems the lockdowns would cause, such as ruined businesses, lost livelihoods, & mental health problems. It was good that we were allowed out for a walk everyday; staying at home for months would have been unbearable! I had an operation to my foot in Feb 2020 and was unable to walk for a while. The friends who were doing my shopping all had to shield except one, a guy who saved me from starvation! (the lockdown came 1 months after my operation - I was still unable to get to shops or a letter box!) Paying my rent & bills was very difficult as I do not have a computer, but I managed to pay them over the phone. I think a better idea for lockdown would have been if most places had stayed open, with plenty of ventilation, hand sanitizing, masks & social distancing. Cafes & coffee bars & pubs could have done takeaway. The very vulnerable should not have been put under house arrest. This is very bad for your mental health (as I found out) especially if you live alone. There could have been suitable safe day centres for them to go to, outside as far as possible. Also buses & coaches could have been made suitable for them to get out & travel.I am not sure if we will ever return to 'normality', at least not in my lifetime. The vaccine programme was brilliant but unfortunately they wear off quite quickly. But they are far better than having no vaccine at all. Also they are to overcome the original Covid, not all the later variants that keep popping up. Maybe scientists are working on this?Re the lockdowns, I think the Prime Minister has done very badly. He said that friends & family must 'rally round' to do the shopping for those incarcerated. This should have been planned by the government so that it worked well & people did not have to worry if they had no-one to do their shopping. With regards to rising energy bills & energy companies going bust, this is an absolute scandal. How are ordinary people expected to pay? Especially those who are already extremely poor. And lots of people will lose their jobs, or have already. My supplier went bust in Spring 2021, but I luckily got a good deal with British Gas, who I was put with by the outgoing company.I think that gas & electricity should be supplied by the state. Then there would not be all the myriad little companies making money from what should be a human right (a warm home, hot food & drink). There would not be hundreds of companies, & hundreds of tariffs. This just causes stress, worry, wastes everyone's time & is unnecessarily complicated. The reason is because everything nowadays is orientated towards profit & privatization. I remember in my youth we just had 'The Gas Board' & 'The Electricity Board'. Both were run by the State & funded by taxation, which is how it should be. We are still paying tax, probably more tax, but it is going into the wallets & offshore bank accounts of company directors & the current government. In those days you would go along to the gas/electricity shops or office, & sign up for your account. No uncertainty or confusion, and it wasn't that expensive. Only one tariff."

Married, one daughter, 44 not living at home Spring 2021 part 1: Household Recycling One day’s recycling: Yesterday’s newspapers plus the sport section from today’s; various loose inserts from a monthly magazine and its compostable wrapper; a can which contained mackerel in korma sauce; envelopes (minus their “windows”)from yesterday’s mail; a non-recyclable polybag to use for wet kitchen rubbish. Recycling at home. – I was born in the year of MO’s wartime surveys on dealing with waste so grew up in the post-war climate of waste not want not and make do and mend and in a household where money was on the short side so, as a result, I’ve always  been fairly conscientious about waste– of things or money. At home we recycle, in one way or another, everything we can and, in our house, recycling includes re-use and repurposing. Newspapers are kept in a box on top of the washer in our rear utility lobby with smaller items like flyers, till receipts, redundant shopping lists, paper wrappings and the like going in a smaller box in an adjacent cupboard ready for the fortnightly collection. Christmas and birthday cards (unless they have glitter on them) go in here, too, or are cut up to use as shopping lists (which are eventually recycled). Cans, plastic bottles and jars, plastic food trays, yoghurt pots, and juice cartons sit on top of the welly boot box in that lobby until someone is going outside and takes them to the wheelie bin. Glass bottles (apart from milk bottles which go back to the farm via a doorstep delivery service) go into a basket in the cupboard under the stairs until collection day. Such polythene carrier bags as come our way go into one of those fabric hanging tubes for re-use. Polythene packaging marked “recycle with bags at larger stores” is kept in one of the larger such bags (e.g. a toast loaf bag) on top of the boot cupboard ready for a supermarket trip. Paper carrier bags and very large polythene ones are folded flat into a box on the washer alongside the newspapers. Aluminium foil goes into a margarine tub on the kitchen windowsill until it is squashed into a ball on recycling collection day. Fabrics are a problem as clothes banks want wearable stuff so we must one day find an organisation that collects rags, otherwise worn out underwear, tea towels etc go into the bottom of the spare room wardrobe for cleaning and polishing tasks that require a soft cloth. Freezer bags are washed and re­used. The greaseproof paper which wrapped three Christmas cakes in their tins until they were iced last Christmas was unmarked and is still being cut into smaller pieces to line cake tins. Fancy carrier bags from presents are stored in the wardrobe in our smallest bedroom (now doing duty as a chaotic study) as is any reusable wrappings. The Christmas versions of these two items are in the loft in a cardboard box, the wrappings being in a series of paper carriers marked large, small and medium sized. Any bubble wrap or tissue paper is saved for re-use. We read a great deal and books, either bought to be read and passed on or from an occasional cull of our shelves, are put aside for charity shops, the charity table at the supermarket we use or one of the Scouts’ collection days at the den. Books tend to be in piles or boxes in the spare bedroom (or under the bed when we are allowed to have visitors again). When church reopened but bookshops didn’tthe whodunnit readers in the congregation arranged a swaps system. -2­W633 Spring 2021 recycling Larger items like wearable clothing and redundant bedding clutter that spare bedroom too, until the Air Ambulance drops off a collection bag. Redundant household items go to the Scouts but tend to stay in their normal place until moved. On charity collection bags, we don’t give items to charities using agencies (Air Ambulance runs it own show) so those bags, turned inside out, line our kitchen dry waste swing bin. Unrecyclable poly bags or cereal box liners live under the sink, in a carrier, and line the container for wet kitchen rubbish (meat wrappings e.g.). The compostable magazine wrappings go into the same carrier and are used to line our worktop compost caddy. All vegetable waste goes in there for transfer to the garden compost heap. Some time ago our daily paper published a chart of the all the triangular symbols containing a number and what type of plastic this designated so we cut it out, laminated it and stuck it behind a kitchen cupboard door. It’s a help but often wrapping looks as if it should be recyclable but there is no symbol with a green circular arrow or a triangle symbol, or there is nothing saying “not yet recyclable”. Just in case it’s not, it goes in the bag for wet rubbish bags. We are aware that the circular motif with comma-shaped symbols just means the makers subscribe to “green” policies and not that the item can be recycled. Recyclable plastic jars and pots and metal cans are rinsed out and left to dry before they go in the bin and foil, especially milk bottle tops, is washed. Recycling collections. – We have a grey wheelie bin, with a green lid, with, lodging in the top on the inner rim, what the council calls a “caddy”, i.e. a bin for paper waste. Everything else acceptable (plastic jars and pots, plastic food trays, cans, foil; aerosols minus their plastic caps and push buttons) goes in the body of the bin. The big drawback of this is a gale on collection day. Obviously paper is far heavier than plastic and cans and the top-heavy bins just keel over and there is paper strewn down the street. Glass bottles go into a separate green box, put out alongside the wheelie bin. Fortnightly collections alternate with general household rubbish collections though we generate so little general rubbish that our general rubbish bin goes out about once in six weeks. The council hasn’t taken textiles for a long time and has now stopped taking Tetrapak-type juice cartons. These cartons go into a container at the tip where we also take uncompostable garden waste in re-used compost bags (we could have a fortnightly garden collection and sometimes share next door’s as I do much of their gardening), metal scrap, broken electrical items and shredded paper which is not acceptable in doorstep collections. The tip is a council one, by appointment only at the moment, but is run very efficiently by a local waste disposal firm and we understand anything recyclable is recycled. Appointments are made via e mail and a print-out or mobile phone screen of the appointment has to be shown on arrival, which must be by car – no vans or trailers as they are regarded as trade and have to pay. It is said that this charge is the cause of much fly-tipping. We have to take it on trust that our doorstep collection is recycled. I can’t think of anything we don’t recycle other than general household waste. -3­W633 Spring 2021 Household Recycling. Why recycle? – Because I was brought up never to waste anything and when most things – food, clothes, coal – were rationed. Nowadays we are also conscious of the need to reduce landfill. Extraction of reusable materials such as metal and paper as well as recycling of usable goods helps to reduce the use of the world’s resources. It is hard not to be aware of climate change and, although we are too old to be around to see if the grimmer predictions come to pass, we feel we must do what we can for future generations. We are dedicated staycationers and spend most holidays in self-catering accommodation. In one coastal town in particular, we find the recycling instructions relate to a narrower range of items than at home so we come back with our bottles and our foil. As far as we are told, our recycling goes to a waste collection centre for sorting into categories which are then adapted to other uses. We have to take it on trust, short of going for a freedom of information answer, which might be terse or heavily redacted. Shopping choices. – We always try to shop sustainably and with recycling in mind with regard to packaging. We avoid over-packaged gift sets at Christmas, buying the items individually and packing them with tissue or shiny shreddings into an attractive box, all of which will have come as packaging for presents for us. As a sidelight, I used to refer to myself jokingly as “Mean-as-Muck Minnie” when doing things like that and it wasn’t until she was in her teens that I found my daughter had always heard it as some stingy Scotswoman called Meenus McMinnie. Funny, living as we do on the edge of Yorkshire with its (unfounded in our experience) reputation for being tight with money I’m not sure why she picked on the Scots. end"

We are lucky in having a large family and they have looked after all our needs for a [long] time. Our son has done our shopping, leacing it on the doorstep, and our daughters help if we need anything. We are both double vaccinated and [...] was the only [time?] we left home until very recently.However, as its our 64th wedding anniversary, we decided to book a holiday in Wales for a few days. Tests have their uses. One of our daughter is a senior sister in a large Hospital. She has been testing regularly as she has been on the front line. She also tests her children regularly though the are also tested at school every other day. Despite all this my daughter took three of her younger children to Wales for a weeks holiday. And although they spent most of their time at the beach and sand, they all came home with the virus. They were all very poorly for over a week and my daughter had had both vaccines. So, before we go to Anglesea we decided to order a Test kit. My husband read the booklet and then put it all away saying it was too complicated. However as the date is getting closer for our trip we decided to try it. It really is very fiddly with so many bits & pieces to us, but we managed it at last and both of us are clear. So we will use the kit again on our return and then try to use it more regularly. Our tests are Lateral flow. Views on the Test and Trace programme. This doesn't seem to have been very successful. Many people that I know of have ignored the isolating and others have had to isolate several times without any idea how their name came forward. There are concerns about the accuracy of the Lateral flow tests. One of our daughters works in the film industry. She has been using Lateral flow kits regularly, but the film company won't accept these tests and she had to take a test ts a Drs or hospital, three times a week, and these tests cost Â£80 each! Luckily the company will pay the bill, so obviously they don't accept the Lateral flow. All down to Tom Cruise I think!"

Female, 67, in a civil partnership – living with partner. London. Retired civil servant. Summer Directive 2021 Part 1: COVID-19 Testing Stories Testing story I do feel a bit shameful to admit that I haven’t yet had a covid test. I do have several boxes of lateral flow tests in the house. I live with my partner, and she tested herself once, using a home testing kit, when she had a sore throat a few weeks ago. The test was negative. As she was still feeling ill, she went to A&E and was again tested as negative, and recovered, but the cause is still being investigated. She wasn’t happy doing the test and only did it because she had no other option, as she had to establish whether she had covid. She preferred to do the test out of my sight but showed me the result. I think I am wary of testing as I do have a sensitive nose, which can be prone to bleeding, and I try to be very careful around blowing it etc. If I do get symptoms, or am in a situation where it is required, I will certainly do it, but I am reluctant to test otherwise. I have had my temperature taken quite frequently when attending the office where I do voluntary work. Throughout the pandemic, I have otherwise been very careful in trying to keep myself and others safe, by social distancing, and wearing a face covering, washing hands etc. Views on testing Test and Trace is a voluntary system which depends on people having a compatible smartphone, downloading the app, and switching the notifications on. It is interesting that it caused for a while, considerable disruption in workplaces, with large numbers of people having to self-isolate, leading to calls to lower the sensitivity. It also, of course, depends on people actually self-isolating when they should. I volunteer on a council run phoneline, contacting people who have been asked to self-isolate because they have tested positive, or been in contact with someone who has tested positive. I have certainly found that a reasonable proportion of the contacts have themselves gone on to develop covid, so I can see how Test and Trace has its place. However, it is estimated that Test and Trace cost around £37 billion to set up. I’m not sure how that could possibly have come about, and feel that a number of people have made lots of money out of the pandemic. It will also be virtually impossible, I would think, to quantify how successful the system has been in controlling the pandemic. I think that justifying spending £37 billion on a system that can’t possibly reach everyone, and can’t be proven to work, is a tall order. I feel that the wearing of face coverings and social distancing should have been maintained until a larger proportion of young people were double-vaccinated, as the vaccine has certainly been proven to work. I certainly have concerns about the accuracy of self-administered covid tests, for the obvious reason that they are self-administered.

I had never heard of her before, but she was the oldest ever Test cricketer. She was born in London in 1911 (unfortunately too late in the year to appear on the 1911 Census) and received her first cricket set when she was 5. She seems to have lived a very interesting life and it is incredible to think that she would have been able to remember the First World War. She remained very active all her life and lived in Norwich, which is quite near me.Covid 19Covid 19 boosters are in full-flood at the moment. I was classified as being 'Clinically Extremely Vulnerable', but there was a problem with the computer programme that issues appointments for the booster injections this year, which meant that for several weeks it refused to let me book a booster. My husband who has nothing wrong with him at all, was able to book before me. Also I am having to go to the neighbouring town for mine. Everything about the pandemic has been handled really badly by this Government and thousands of people have died unnecessarily as a result. But they have been very proactive in the vaccination programme. Basically everyone has been able to do whatever they want this year, with no concern for anybody else, but they ought to get vaccinated. This would be fine, except a lot of people are following the Government's lead in only thinking about themselves and they don't want to get vaccinated. Energy BillsEnergy bills are rising at an alarming rate and many of the smaller suppliers have gone bust. I am not quite sure how you can have so many companies supplying the same thing from the same source, but that is Capitalism for you. It means that more people can make more money out of something that should be a service, because it is a necessity. When I was young, electricity, gas, water and the railways were nationalised, but now the same stuff belongs to companies to make money out of. Working conditions are usually worse, but rich shareholders make a lot of money, so that's OK then. Remembrance DayRemembrance Day was first commemorated in 1919, so it must have taken 2 years to decide to use the poppy as a symbol of remembrance.Writing this I inevitably think of my 2 great uncles, XXXX and XXXX, who were both killed in France in 1918. That seems a very long time ago, but each of my grandmothers lost a brother, and so I knew the generation who lost brothers in the Great War.My father's brother, XXXX, was killed in Tunisia in 1943 in the Second World War and so his mother lost a brother in the First War and a son in the Second. I don't think that she ever got over it, she was very strange when I knew her and used to sit in her armchair rocking backwards and forwards, saying 'Never, never. Never, never.'When we used to live in the country, on the anniversary of Uncle XXXX's death I used to stand on top of the hill near us, look around, and say, 'You fought and died for this Uncle XXXX and I really appreciate it'. But recently I have become ashamed of this country and its racism and greedy Government, so I don't say that any more. I think that it's a good job that Uncle XXXX doesn't known what is going on in this country at present. I always think of all 3 of them each Remembrance Day and usually play 'Nimrod' on You Tube. When I am feeling particularly upset I play it very loud, but that worries the dog. Sir David Amess MPBefore Sir David Amess MP was killed I had never heard of him. He was a Constituency MP and never held a Government post. He opposed same-sex marriage and abortion amongst other things. But he also felt very strongly about animal welfare and protested about live animal exports, so he can't have been all bad. Having said that it is appalling that any MP should be killed in the line of their work. This Government is very extreme and I presume that an extreme Government is more likely to create a violent atmosphere. Owen Patterson MPI won't write about Owen Patterson MP, because why single him out? The whole Government is bad. They are totally inhuman as far as I can see. The Queen and Prince AndrewI feel very sorry for the Queen this year. Prince Philip died and she must miss him terribly. I am 63 and have never known a world without the Queen and Prince Philip. I knew them longer than I knew my parents.Prince Harry and Meghan have cause her a lot of problems; they want to get away from the Royal Family, which I can understand. But they also want to use their Royal titles to make more money and be celebrities in America. The Royal Family should make a rule banning any of them from marrying Americans, they always cause trouble. Mrs Simpson caused huge problems in 1936 and now Meghan is carrying on the tradition. I don't think that Americans understand the Royal Family and the Queen's loyalty and dedication to this country.Unfortunately I don't think that Prince Andrew understood it either. In the past he was able to get away with unacceptable things involving young women, because people were just happy to fawn around him. Things have changed and he could find that his Royal position doesn't protect him from justice. He just seems like a selfish, over-privileged man nowadays. Arthur Labinjo-HughesThis 6 year old boy was killed on 16 June 2020 by his father's new partner. His father was involved in torturing him.Yesterday they were sentenced for their crime. The woman, Emma Tustin was convicted of murder and was sentenced to at least 29 years in prison and the boy's father, Thomas Hughes was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to at least 21 years in prison.What they did to this poor little boy was unbelievably terrible and hopefully somebody will get to these people in prison and do to them, what they did to Arthur.

B4290, married, 52, Cambridgeshire, public sector, March 2022.Covid-19 at the time of writing (March 2022) is still with us. The numbers of hospital in-patients at Addenbrookes are low these day: c.40 but plenty of people are still catching the latest strain - Omicron. One of our chums came down with it yesterday and is a schoolteacher in a secondary school in Essex. If you are triple-jabbed with no known or unknown pre-existing medical conditions, then you have a high chance of surviving. Long Covid is still affecting people, but the virus is, at the time of writing I should say, is doing what most viruses do: mutating to more transmissible, but less lethal strains. It does not want to wholesale kill off its hosts. Our next-door neighbours caught Omicron over Xmas but ten days later they were all back on their feet again. Their cousin, by contrast, caught the Delta variant in Spring 2021 and ten days later he was dead.My peculiar in-laws failed to abide by lock-down rules and have treated the pandemic as a personal affront to their liberty.Returning to work and normalityI have worked all through the pandemic, both when living in West Suffolk and now in East Cambridgeshire, commuting into Cambridge. My current post had already been altered for home-working so I now have a choice of home working or a hybrid roster with my two other office colleagues.On the days when I go into the office using my bike on the train, I still wear a mask, but the vast majority of people are not. I would not mind so much but modern trains do not have openable windows to assist with ventilation. Air-conditioning systems just spread germs around the carriages, so I often open the doors at intervening stations just to get some air into carriages. Rising energy billsElectricity and gas were never a concern for my parents in the 1960s or '70s or for me when I ran my flat in the 1980s and 90s. but how this has changed since privatisation. Luckily, we left out last fuel company before it went bust and set a fixed tariff with our new company but this is not guarantee of longer-term assurance. And what about those who could not afford to negotiate or change in time? I resent all the time we have to spend just finding a (functioning) fuel company: again, something we didn't need to do in years gone by. Martin Lewis, the money-saving-expert, recently said that unless Government steps in this year we shall see absolute (now relative) poverty arriving at the doorsteps of many lower-paid and fixed income households. After twelve years of Tory Governments this, sadly, does not come as a surprise to me. The Tories look out for themselves and their mates in big business and seem to have a punishment agenda for the rest of us. I find it utterly astonishing that people who notice all these declines in their standards of living still vote Tory. The Poppy Centenary. Mixed feelings about this. The Nazis had to be stopped and we ought to be thankful to the PBIs (Poor Bloody Infantry), but we seem to throw our weight around the world on the flimsiest pretences now. Anyway, the wounded need to be cared for so I put the money in the pot but no longer wear a poppy.David Amess, despite him being an anti-choice Tory, appeared to a good constituency MPs. His extremist Catholic stance made him in my eyes a religious nutcase, but he didn't deserve to be killed by another religious nutcase.Prince AndrewThis man has no moral compass, yet according to Private Eye's reports he still believes he can be rehabilitated to full strength royal duties. More worryingly there are silly people out there who believe that he should. Charity work is his only hope now, providing it is sincerely executed. I'm no raving monarchist but we do pay for this family which gives me a right of reply. I think the monarchy ought to be slimmed down to 'One Spouse and One House'.Owen Patterson broke the rules and got caught but Boris tried to get the rules changed in order to keep his mate in Parliament. No surprise from the man who prorogued Parliament in 2019 because it wasn't working for him them either. Perhaps Boris thinks he's Charles the First. Perhaps he hasn't thought that analogy through. Enoch Powell (of all people) said that all political careers end in failure and this thought keeps me going when I watch the present shambles. Home Secretary Priti Patel is trying to pass a Police and Crime Bill to severely restrict UK citizens' rights to protest whilst simultaneously supporting Ukrainian citizens' right to protest..."

Priority in many other arenas was given to those working.Worker-only trains and busses would be a huge help in the summer of 2021.There are too many retired people going on holiday or taking their grandchildren on day-trips on peak time trains. They appear to have very little self-awareness of this selfishness.Indeed, the 'missing our grandchildren' phenomenon has thrown up just how empty many retirees' lives are without them, despite their level of education, past careers, interests etc.All of our chums have noticed this, despairingly.

I have had all 3 jabs + have not so far contracted Covid but I think that the government are very unwise to stop all the restrictions as they intend doing. There seems to be no medical backing for this decision - where are Prof Witty etc? - we haven't seen them for months, suspicions must arise that Boris is doing this to distract from 'Partygate' and other scandals. Rising energy bills. People on low or fixed incomes are being overwhelmed in every direction - income tax, insurance, electricity + gas bills, shopping bills even for essentials like bread + milk - I think my own shopping bill has gone up by 10% during the last few weeks. The government doesn't seem to care - the Prime Minister complains that he cant live on his income + has £800 a roll wallpaper put into No 10. He hasn't got a clue how much ordinary people are struggling. The centenary of the red poppy - I dont feel particularly strongly about this as I dont approve of the way the Ministry of Defence has wasted money for years. The murder of Sir David Amess. This was dreadful + he is the 2nd MP to be murdered in the last few years. Events such as Boris' jibe at Keir Stamer about Jimmy Saville don't help - they only serve to encourage extreme right wing conspiracy theories and he should have been ashamed of himself but he doesn't do 'shame'. Government U turns. This government only seems to care about themselves and not getting defeated. If there seems to be opposition they are happy to do a U turn to keep their majority. The lawsuit involving Prince Andrew is aa disgrace and embarrassment - particularly to the Royal Family + the Queen. The photograph of him with his arm around a girl he claims not to remember rings very fake. Otherwise it doesn't rate the amount of publicity it gets since he is fighting it as an ordinary citizen apparently! Now settled out of court.The situation between Russia + Ukraine.

I am in Northern Ireland where the rules have been slightly different and slightly stricter. For reference, I have not been to the pub since they shut on October 16th last year and even then some didn't open at all over the summer. I haven't travelled anywhere in a year. Since 24th December 2019 (when I arrived back from a brief break in Spain) I have slept under the same roof every night. Surely the longest period for me in my life where that is true.There is no sign that things will change at the next anticipated milestone on March 6th. Christmas was entirely uneventful. I spent it with my mother at her house where I have been for the duration. For two hours on boxing day we met (under regulations) at my aunt's house and another aunt was there too. 3 sisters and me.We zoom with my brother in Scotland and his daughter via WhatsApp sometimes but not every day. The granddaughter is 20 months old and has grown up so much and neither me nor 'granny' has seen much of that wonderful time. Granny went over last January to Scotland and again in August but would have been there many more times since had she been able. I haven seen them since August 2019.Of course, boredom has led to massive mental health issues. I have depression that depression and anxiety has ebbed and flowed. I find routine is important and getting up and walking is vital. I miss swimming. I manage 12k steps daily. Shopping is a weekly routine. Big shop in Lidl (who don't do online shopping) and a top up shop has been routine since last March. Not much else.!The winter has been a great deal harder than summer for lockdown and the mood is palpably less upbeat. We now know that many business will fail and unemployment and the likes will be bad. I keep sane by promising myself two months in Spain when its all over and I can go to our flat there. I dont know how or when I will be able to revive my flagging career.I have received no government money as a self employed person with a poor record. So I have managed to do some jobs and earn some cash. But I don't really need much apart from for alcohol. I have struggled to be measured in my drinking. Some of which I do secretly. I am saving my money for a two month stint in spain in summer. I really want to spend some time alone and not in this small flat/house with my mum. It's not good of either of us.I use Twitter a lot to read the news and get opinion. I don't think the government has done a good job. I hate Boris Johnson and his 'world beating' rhetoric and Churchillian approach. It grates me. Matt Hancock seems increasingly deranged and Rishi Sunak wants the top job but seems very young. I am still sore and annoyed about Barnard Castle and Dominic Cummings.The NI executive had wobbled since the autumn and Arlene and Michelle do not inspire confidence and seem to prefer squabbling. It's a shame because up until Sammy Wilson and also the IRA funeral, the executive was working well. Esp considering that it was so new. Robert Swann is the best of them.we pin our hopes on the vaccine. 71 year old mother hasn't received notification yet. But the promise is she will get a jab in the next two weeks.

Every day on the news something happens to bring it to life. Whether it's about injections or Boosters. I expect it will never go away and we will have to keep having injections, just like the 'FLU' jab!!This country is so lucky to be able to give us injections free of charge. Without our N.H.S. where would we be??How well I remember the old days when my parents struggled to pay a doctors bill!! I can still remember the people in our doctors surgery, coughing and sneezing everywhere. If they had no money, they gave the doctor dead rabbits or eggs from their chickens, as payment. What a lovely doctor he was and knew us all by name! He often came to our house as a friend, to have a cup of tea and a chat. Can't see that happening in todays world!!I am still struggling to get my 91 year old Husband, who is housebound, his COVID Booster jab! I have been told he is 'on a list' with the district nurses, but so far he has not had it. My feelings about the people who will not have the COVID injection, is one of dismay. Perhaps the N.H.S should charge them for their care if they catch covid and are in hospital. We certainly can't leave them without care, even it's their own fault.A small thought about Prince ANDREW and the lawsuit which is pending. It is up to him to tell the truth even if he is guilty of a sex offence. Evading questions makes him seem more guilty. After all he is only a man, and men will take sex if its offered! I would prefer him to stand up and be counted. As it is, he seems to be hiding behind his Royal status!"

It was for the Pfizer and I had a second dose on 10th Jan. 21The first jab was on 20m Dec. 20 and on Christmas Eve I felt a bit unwell and all day on 25···felt quite poorly- a slight temperature, vomiting, aching, and exhaustion. By 26m I felt completely recovered. After the second dose I experienced the same symptoms four days after the jab but this time they seemed worse and lasted a bit longer.I do still follow all me government guidelines such as staying at home, wearing a mask etc. moreout of social responsibility than fear of catching anything.I am not worried about taking vaccines as I accept that they are as safe as can be and much safer than the disease they are protection against.I get most of my information on the vaccines from the BBC news and politics programmes. Members of my family also update me from time to time but that information is not always consistent as they get some of it from social media and other sources.Vaccine 'passports' may well become mandatory for foreign travel and that will be up to the countries we wish to visit. The UK may also require such 'passports' for foreigners arriving at this country.The other issue. which I see as quite different is another matter. I am not in favour of domestic 'Covid-19 passports' as I view these as potentially very divisive. Given that those who cannot have the vaccine may be catered for in any such arrangements it will still be a case of those who can afford to pay for the documentation as it almost certainly will cost something to obtain. This would be most unfair and divisive.I also believe that the Insurance sector will have a great deal of influence over these decisions unless the government is very careful. Insurance Companies may well decide not to insure various businesses, especially those dealing with the public and possibly care homes, without staff having such passports and those members of staff, in general, are often the less well paid or on zero hour contracts. These would lead to all sorts of problems.I know that there are a few situations. such as certain medical practitioners. where mandatory vaccination is required for serious safety reasons. That is understandable, however, in normal everyday situations I am certainly against such a move and would not be prepared, personally, to accept such a proposal.O407Getting the Vaccine	20.12.20Two thirty on a very sunnv sundav afternoon in mid December. Cold and crispy, dazzling and bustling. Somany cars approaching the Christmas Tree roundabout and on into Tesco - last minute shopping I decided as I gingerly crossed the road and made for the surgery.There I found a large. rubber roofed gazebo. a line of benches. an official with a clip board. and a queue of the elderly, infirm and at times, bemused patients, patiently waiting as during the war. Most of the cars that I had observed going into Tesco car park were now disgorging more elderlv onto the tail of the queue. Icould not understand where they were all coming from.A muted. and excited buzz pervaded as the clipboard official gradually ushered people into the surgery, having asked the questions and ticked the boxes.It came to my turn, 'Are you well? Do you have a temperature? What surgery is it? This final question threw me, 'The vaccination surgery,' I said.'No, what surgery?''I don't understand. I am here for a vaccination.' 'Yes. but what surgery?'What do you mean?''Which surgery do you go to?''Well. this one of course!' 'Are there others?Turned out that my local surgery had become a hub for vaccination and served seven other areas in the region. Well, at least that explained all the cars .....I was ushered in towards T who stopped me for a moment and then ushered me on to J. who moved me on to F and gradually I processed through a labyrinth of floor arrows and smiling staff who seemed totreating me as if I was the queen. It was all so dignified, pleasant and gracious. Each time I was moved on I was given the name of the next usher until. at last. I was claimed by one of the local doctors to come into his room. Dr. S. who asked for a shoulder. I took off my coat and gave him the requested shoulder while a nurse asked a few questions. Name, address, allergies, thinners, previous recent vaccinations etc. by which time the vaccine was in. totally painlessly. and Dr. S said that there was no blood so he didn't need to cover the entry point. Nurse gave me a little card to say what I had received and when and also a slip of paper with 2.42 written on it. They both smiled and passed me on to D who ushered me into a small room with a few chairs and asked me wait there with my coat off.In this post vaccine waiting room the atmosphere was different, quieter, more reflective with a gentle senseof waiting. Only four others in there and no conversation, just a peaceful silence, every few minutes brokenby another usher to check on us and who could go now as indicated by our small slips of paper.I took the opportunity to reflect on this extraordinary journey ,I thought about the total dedication to learning of the scientists who became skilled and knowledgeable enough to produce this vaccine. the hours of disciplined research. the huge amount of money invested, the checking and the logistics of it all. I thought about how unaware I was of exactly what it had taken to bring me here today. I considered the graciousness of the staff here who had been at this for hours and were still smiling and caring. I was overwhelmed. I even thought of Boris and all his mishandling and my annoyance with him, and felt grateful that he had considered it important for me to be very near the front of the queue so I sort of almost forgave him.I became aware of how overwhelmed with gratitude I felt and I wanted to cry. I did not cry however because I did not want to be kept here after 2.42. I would wait until I came home.So. another process through the arrows and ushers to the great outdoors again and a gentle stroll home in the fading light. I came in, took of my coat, and put all the Christmas lights on in celebration of what I have received and more in celebration of the human spirit and humanity which made all of it possible.A very Happy Christmas Present Now I can cry."

Retired train driver living in Basildon UK Events Rising energy bills I don’t think that essential resources such as water, electricity, gas and transport should be privatised because this distorts the market and means that ordinary people pay higher bills while rich people grow richer. This means that society becomes less equal. When an energy company collapses it’s losses have to be covered by an addition to consumers bills. How is that fair? The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York If the prince was innocent or had integrity or a spine he would go to the USA and defend himself but because of the murky things he has done he is stuck in limbo and will be until he dies. This shows the whole royal family in a bad light. Perhaps it’s time to get rid of them."

Married. Ex-train driver aged 67. Covid-19 Testing. Before I developed problems with my heart which necessitated taking drugs I was a blood donor and I must be on a government database because I’m often contacted to participate in health related surveys. I am currently in two covid surveys, one of which involves a monthly covid PNR test. This survey is run by the Office of National Statistics and I’ve been providing samples for about eighteen months. I’ve never needed a test because I have had symptoms because I haven’t been ill since the pandemic started. At times there has been a shortage of tests for people who suspect that they are infected and I have felt doubtful that I should be using a test myself because that could go to a person who needs it more than I do. I get £25 in the form of a shopping voucher for doing the test and I think that’s wrong too. This is a country where many people are on the poverty line, barely surviving. Surely that money could be put to better use? Recently the survey wanted to take a blood sample as well as the PNR test and said that if I agreed to do it I would get another £25 voucher. I already send a blood sample every couple of months to Cambridge University for their covid survey. I’m not paid for that so I agreed to provide a sample for the ONS. I feel slightly concerned by how much money all this is costing and also that all these organisations are sampling the same cohort of people. It takes me a minute to do the nose and throat test and ten to fifteen minutes to do the blood test. If I get £50 then that’s an hourly rate of £200 which is crazy. It’s not really government money, it’s tax-payer money. I have some concerns about the accuracy of lateral flow tests. The media reports that only two thirds of them are accurate. Why do we spend money on buying them? This is just another badly handled aspect of coronavirus: I think that the whole thing is a disaster."

In the third part of the Directive, we have made a list of events you might wish to write about: . COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” . Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” . The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 . The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess .

Please take some time to comment on any of these subjects, or on any other items from the news, which you feel we should be covering at this time. We want to hear your opinions, along with details about conversations you have had, or stories and experiences and reactions to reports in the press. Covid-19: The booster programme is going well although, now with the Omicron variant permeating through the country, I don’t think that relying on boosters as your main line of defence is a particularly good move. My booster is booked in for 7th January 2022 and I feel quite vulnerable, unsure whether or not to go ahead with my Christmas travel plans. I’m only going to see my family and then stay with friends but it’s unsure how safe that is. I know a lot of people who have caught Covid within the past month or two and the current figures are scarily high. It feels like the government has given up. They’ve never given the impression that they knew what they were doing at all (vote for a clown, get a circus) but they seem weaker than ever. I’ve been going into work twice a week. I live in a two bedroom flat but my husband also work form home and I value the work/home split. Going out to the office has been a nice change of scene. My commute is a walk and the office is still very quiet anyway. However, as of last week the official line has been to go back to working from home full-time if you can. Working from home is fine but it’s easy not to leave the house. That wouldn’t be too bad but I feel like a lot of my extra-curricular activities are under threat and the shadow of lockdown looms over us again. Gig runs from artists I like have been cut short and theatre productions have been cancelled because someone in the cast or crew has caught Covid. It’s precarious right now and I feel like we’re in for a grim winter. Again. January 2021 was one of the most depressing months of my life. This deja vu is not a good feeling. Energy Bills and Energy Companies Going Bust: We’ve always been quite good at switching to energy companies that give us the best price. However, in the recent spate of energy companies going bust our supplier was one of the first to go under. We were automatically switched over to British Gas and we’re now just waiting to see what happens. British Gas have just offered us a fixed rate which is £200 more a year than our current variable rate. It might be a gamble to stay put but I can’t put too much energy into worrying about it. I’m aware that I’m privileged to say that. Our flat is fairly warm and we only have electricity so we’ll just see what happens. O4128 Male 37 Years Old Married Leeds Librarian The Centenary of the red poppy: My relationship with the poppy is complicated. I completely support the commemoration of the deaths of the World Wars. If we don’t remember then we’re doomed to repeat those same mistakes again. But the poppy as a symbol has been highjacked in recent years. If TV presenters don’t wear them they get angry letters. The policing of the poppy really does not sit right with me. It’s been politicised in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. We should all have the right to wear or not wear the poppy as we see fit (if I did wear one it would be a white poppy). Another thing I find complicated is the beautification of the poppy. To mark the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 a ceramic poppy was put in the grounds of the Tower of London, one each for every soldier’s death. It was stunning and poignant but the knock on effect of this is that poppy installations are now a common sight around the country. In the following years part of that Tower of London exhibition travelled around the country. I went to see it at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. I even had my photo taken with it. Should I have done? It was beautiful but I should have looked at it and seen something horrific, not something artistic. The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess: Living in quite polarised times, it was sad to see another MP killed doing their job. It was like we had learned nothing after the death of Jo Cox. What I did not like was how the Conservative party used Amess’ death as an excuse to crack down on how social media was used. Social media had nothing to do with Amess’ death, they just used it to suit their agenda. It made me angry although I can’t say I was surprised. The current government are rotten to the core. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn: Sigh. I wish that people would call Owen Paterson’s conduct for what it is. It wasn’t ‘sleaze’, it was corruption. And they’re all at it. The Tory Party think that rules are for other people. It doesn’t help that Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, is a man who has never felt the consequence of any of his actions in his entire life and it shows. I remember the ‘sleaze’ scandals in the 1990s but that was a few backbenchers. Now it goes right up to the top. They don’t care. How many cabinet ministers have been accused of misconduct now? But they all get to keep their jobs (apart from Paterson who resigned. That felt like a miracle in itself) as their party would rather change the rules rather than follow them. At this point I don’t know how we dare to call ourselves a democracy, we’re too authoritarian for that. Denmark sent one of their MPs to jail this week for breaking the law as ‘we’d rather not become like the UK’. There is something rotten in the state of England. It’s the Tory Party. Related to this scandal I’ve just seen the results of the North Shropshire bi-election. The Liberal Democrats took the seat from the Tories for the first time in nearly 200 years! Delightful. The hilarious thing is that if the Tories had played by the rules like in a proper democracy Paterson could have got a 30 day suspension and kept his seat. There isn’t much joy in having Boris Johnson as the Prime Minister. I know that he grew up with the entitlement to rule but I’m always surprised by how bad he is at it. A truly terrible speaker (but when you’ve got by bumbling along with no filter and no oratory skills and being rewarded for it it shouldn’t be a surprise) and a man that makes decisions by dithering around until only one final bad option is left on the table. The only consolation is that he looks like he’s hating the whole thing. He’s aged about 10 years during his 2 year tenure. I do take a slight pleasure in that. You know, among all of the neo-fascist and anti-democratic decisions. The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York: I know that our laws are signed off by The Queen but her family should have to follow the same rules as the rest of us. If Andrew was involved in the Jeffrey Epstein case then he should stand trial. I hate that my tax money is paying for his legal fees. O4128 Male 37 Years Old Married Leeds Librarian Christmas party scandal/s: The one thing that I find that really strange about the recent discovery that the Conservatives held Christmas parties (and laughed about it) while lockdown laws were in place last December is that *this* of all things is what has made everyone turn against them. The Windrush scandal, toxic attitudes towards migrants, PPE shortages, handing out contracts to friends, food poverty, corruption. I mean, every day brings new reasons to hate the Tories and yet this is the one thing that has stuck. Maybe it’s because this is the one thing that the ruling party can’t blame on someone else. It’s not the EU, it’s not immigrants, it was them and them alone. We have a massively right wing (and sycophantic) press but even they are angry. One thing that is quite reassuring though is that under all of the propaganda there is good journalism being done in this country. Finally, someone is holding our leaders to account. I just can’t believe that this of all things was the straw that broke the camel’s back. (Written on 17th December 2021)"

The threat of another 'circuit breaker' ie lockdown is looming over us because of the Omicron variant of Coronavirus. Hopefully the powers that be will let us have the next couple of weeks lockdown free (not that Boris, Nicola etc follow the rules) and then, if needs must, have a lockdown at some future date. I think everyone is sick of covid and all the misery it brought from unemployment and homelessness and mental health problems to actually being hospitalised with it. We all want to return to usual. I've had all my Covid vaccinations and ordinary flue jab as well and all I'm doing this week is going to the supermarket once, to avoid contact with anyone who might have Covid. A friend I was speaking to yesterday has a daughter who works in XXXX, our local hospital, and is quite high up, says that all the people hospitalised there for Covid are all under 40 and all unvaccinated. So why do the idiots not get their vaccinations? I have a good friend in New Zealand, a teacher, and she will not get her vaccination, even though the rest of her family have, because she thinks the drug companies are all in some giant conspiracy and it's all about control. She is in Auckland, and because of lockdown there, has been teaching from home but she is in danger of losing her job if lockdown ends and teachers go back into classrooms. Their summer holidays have begun there so she has some time to think about it all. I think she's mad. We're scared of catching the Omicron variant, so today, two days before Xmas we walk to our local shops, pick up a prescription, and walk home. No getting buses there or back, no browsing in shops, just the minimum contact with people. Energy bills. We have gas central heating but everything else is electric. We have a smart meter in the kitchen so we can see what we are using. We are very careful with heating - even on cold days we don't switch it on before 2:30pm at the earliest and it goes off mid evening - about 7:50pm once our living room has warmed up. We have sort of like electric blankets that are furry on one side and fleecy on the other and you can use them as they are _ _ _ temperatures from 1-5. They are not for beds, but for putting over you, over your lap and upper body - they are big. We use them in the morning at breakfast time, at lunchtime and in the evening all through winter.If you set the dial to 4 you use more energy than if it's at 3, we only centrally heat the room we're in, the bedroom heater goes on about 6pm to 7:30 or 8pm, we never heat the kitchen, hall or spare bedroom and only heat the bathroom briefly at night if I have my shower then. I shower in the morning and _ _ _ _.If we have visitors we heat the living/dining room, hall and bathroom from about an hour before they are due, and turn off everything the minute they've gone. A couple of weeks ago we did this then the next day got an email from Ovo electricity suggesting we put our monthly payment up from £96 to £124 - on the basis of one days unusual usage!Our contract with Ovo comes to an end in June and there are no deals to be had apparently.

P1326 Female, aged 82, married, living with husband and one son in a rural location near Bath. Retired Civil Servant COVID-19 First of all, there have been a number of comparisons of the current crisis to 1939. Well, my early childhood memories of wartime London are pretty different. It was grey and drab and cold with lots of bombed out buildings. The food was pretty unappetising too. Not a bit like today, and it lasted a lot longer. People lived with the dread prospect of Nazi troops taking over the country. I have never much liked China and its culture. We meet individual Chinese people here, and they are nice people, many highly educated. Their science goes back way further than Western science. It is their Communist leaders with their inhumane treatment of minorities and dissidents, their cruel treatment of animals, their wretched ‘wet markets’ and their ‘traditional medicine’ using animal parts like rhino horn, and pangolins being driven to extinction for discredited scientific reasons. Neighbouring people in eastern Asia, like Tibet, have to struggle against their domination, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Through my elder son, ES, we have had direct links with Mongolia and have met and entertained visiting academics. The Mongolians can co-operate with their Russian neighbours. They have links with several European countries, but the Chinese they simply do not trust. They have not trusted them since before the time of Genghis Khan. India too is dealing with armed Chinese incursion over its NE frontier in Ladakh and unarmed Indian soldiers killed. With their repressive Communist regime, the Chinese could easily abolish wet markets that have been responsible for previous pandemics. Instead, they tried to suppress the news of the outbreak. It is now suggested the virus originated from an experimental laboratory near Wuhan. Difficult to prove of course, but back in 2018, there were fears about the bio-security of the lab in question. True to their nature, the Chinese government are trying to put the blame on others like the Americans and have convinced their own people. In my opinion, the Chinese regime is despicable. They should be made to pay for the damage they have caused to people’s lives across the world. There was a letter recently in the paper from a couple who had lived in China up until a decade or so ago, and had found the people reasonably friendly and easy to deal with. It was only when Xi Jinping came to power that the worst repression, and the international aggression really started. On the subject of ‘wet markets’ a recent letter in the paper pointed out that in countries where rural areas have no electricity for refrigeration (eg for many Africans) wet markets were essential, but I do not imagine that applies in Wuhan. There are always two sides to an argument, I suppose. Anyway, having got that off, a report of our experiences will, I am sorry, be disjointed. One of the first news items was of passengers confined to their cabins on some world-wide cruise ships and I am afraid I felt very little sympathy. However, in a similar situation a couple of years ago, involving an epidemic on another cruise ship, I expressed similar sentiments, and was gently rebuked by a friend (no more able to afford a cruise than us). She said there would be some passengers on that ship who had saved for years for the ‘trip of a lifetime’, which had then been ruined. She was right of course. I still would not choose a cruise liner to see the world even if I could. The first indication here was when the attendant at our local petrol station handed my husband B a whole box of disposable gloves ‘for regular customers’, for their personal protection, the sort of gloves they dispense at the fuel pumps. He said they had also been instructed by the company to wash their hands every half hour. It was reassuring to see a doctor on local TV demonstrating how the virus could be dispersed and destroyed simply with soap and hot water. A helpful e-mail circulated around our parish (origin, an American University) said that COVID19 was not a living organism but a protein molecule covered by a protective layer of fat, hence the effectiveness of soap and hot water. Unlike bacteria, it cannot be destroyed by anti-biotics or ‘bacteriacides’. An old friend, our retired solicitor, now a widower, told us he was going to the airport to meet his Chinese friend (we have not met her) who had just been home to Hong Kong to visit her family. He was taking her a supply of groceries and then they were going to self-isolate. Later, a couple of mutual friends phoned to ask us if he was all right as they had failed to contact him. He is home now and said he found the isolation very trying. He is a ‘pillar of the town’ and always involved in local affairs. He and B are both philatelists, now busy sorting their stamp collections and swapping surplus by leaving boxes at their respective front doors, then waving from the car. A stamp dealing friend is having trouble continuing his business in the circumstances so he is sending B big boxes in the post, ‘sweepings from the floor’ he says, which B then sorts and shares. Meanwhile the Chinese lady is busy at home making face masks. B is due to have an operation in the Bristol Hospital cardio-vascular clinic. It is classed as ‘elective’ surgery and has been postponed indefinitely, simply because they need to be sure of an Intensive Care bed for recovery. B was worried that his case constitutes an ‘underlying health problem’ and he thought his chances of surviving if he caught the virus were less than 50%. I tried to persuade him he does not have a disease, he just needs a repair job. His general health is good. He is not in the same position as people having chemo-therapy for example or asthma. We should have been on holiday just now. When the date for the operation was first provisionally fixed, we brought forward our holiday plans. I pointed out that April in Cumbria often meant snow. Ironically, the weather now, this year has been better than we have ever known. I wonder – ‘Is it better to be isolated at home in wall-to wall sunshine when you long to be out exploring the country, or cold and gloomy when you want to huddle indoors?’. Bright sunshine wins every time. However, I am longing for the wide Westmorland Fells, Hadrian’s Wall country, the great open skies of the Solway Firth. We rarely go to the Lakes these days because of the crowds (and our days of walking the high tops are gone I am afraid) but it must be beautiful just now for those who live there. One could say ‘Well, there’s always next year’ but for us now, there might not be a next year, and we had already paid for our stay. The cottage owner said we could transfer our booking to later, but I doubt that will be possible. Likewise a provisionally booked autumn stay in Pembrokeshire. It is worse for the farmers (who have become friends), who rely on holiday bookings for part of their annual income. Our village Art Group normally meets weekly in the village hall and by March 12, we were asked if any of us thought we should suspend. We all firmly kept our hands down, feeling that life was for living and we were not going to cower at home in fear of infection. However, I did go into the kitchen and give the Hall’s tea mugs a good wash (some of them rather stained). We tend to blame the Toddler Group Mums for this. The Yoga group in turn complain that we leave traces of paint or chalk pastels that stain their mats! The cleaner came in and announced she was taking away the tea towels which she normally launders, and leave paper rolls instead. She is someone who, when seen coming, strikes fear into our leader (a retired teacher) even though half her age. She is the local ‘busybody’ (she has also locked the gate of the children’s playground) but we could hardly function without her. Village politics! By the next week however, it was clear that a-self isolation policy was not about us, but about stopping the virus for everybody’s sake, so we stopped meeting. I also sent out emails about the monthly Coffee Get-Together that I organise for a group of friends in the village. A couple of older members e-mailed back saying they had been thinking reluctantly that they ought to ‘give it a miss’ and self-isolate. They thanked me for making the decision for them. Another friend wondered why, but she lives in a world of her own! I phoned the pub where we meet and they said they had been expecting it, thanking me for letting them know. The pub has been run by a local family for two generations and we feel we owe them loyalty so, when ‘lock-down’ came a couple of days later, we were pleased to hear they had switched their kitchen operations to making take-away meals, like a number of other enterprising caterers. There was also an invitation to the village to take along any suitable containers we could lay our hands on to collect all his surplus beer! A week before that, (March 10) I had been into town for a routine dental check. I always go early in the day to avoid the crowds. Since retiring, I have never caught flu, or similar viral infections, but B was getting nervous, so to placate him, I wore a pair of the disposable gloves on the Park and Ride, feeling a bit silly. I removed them inside the Dentist’s door and the receptionist smiled and said ‘I see you have come prepared’. She pointed to a bottle of hand sanitiser on the counter. I also went to the Central Library and was pleased to see not one, but two books by favourite authors that I quickly grabbed. I already had one book at home, together with a couple of non-fictions from the mobile library, so I felt prepared for at least a few weeks lock down. Later, the Library e-mailed borrowers telling us our books were automatically renewed until July. We had been hearing on the news about the lock down in France and wondered how the Parisians were coping. The next day I went to the chiropodist, again wearing gloves until inside the door. She insisted on giving me a pair of blue, medical issue gloves to take away with me. ES, who has a degree in forestry, had to give up his rented cottage a few years ago and move back with us. It has led to an over-crowded house (and fridge!) but it is handy to have him here now. His girlfriend is a professional (not sure what) at Bath Hospital so of course, she is isolated from social contact. One of his part time jobs is Clerk to the Parish Council, whose elected members are stood down for the duration, so the Local Authority, who pay him a small salary, have told him he is in charge! The last job the Parish did was to put out a flier to everyone, listing contacts for fetching shopping, volunteer help, ‘someone to talk to if needed’. Our local sub-Postmaster has always taken supplies to the housebound from his small shop, so he was co-ordinator. However, he is already run off his feet, and it was found that people were using it for trivial errands, and the social media site for ‘silly chit-chat’ so the group of volunteers has taken over. ES cycled the village to distribute fliers. The cricket field, used by the village for decades, probably a century, legally belongs to the adjoining estate, recently having a new owner, a well known business tycoon. He has just applied to replace the attractive traditional wooden pavilion, which is in perfectly good shape, with a modern building quite out of character, and also do some ‘landscaping’. We know full well that this term means fencing off the field, stopping everybody from walking their dogs around the outside (polite notices ask people to keep dogs off the ‘in-field’ and clean up after them -some ‘poo-bins’ are provided). He already has a large estate. Why does he need to keep the village out of the field? He cannot reclaim the smaller adjoining green that a previous ‘squire’ gave to the village in perpetuity. Loss of the cricket field area would however be a blow to those who want to walk round, or just sit and watch cricket (few of the village team are actually resident). It would mean the end of the big summer fete that attracts people for miles around, with marquees, stalls and games and dog shows and a band. There is simply not enough room for it on the smaller green, let alone any car parking. We are sure his London financial advisers have chosen this time deliberately to apply for planning permission. ES, with the Parish Chairman, is going to ask for an extension to the Planning Appeal period. In the meantime, B as always, is spending half the day chatting on the phone to old friends, retired colleagues, cousins he grew up with and many more distant cousins he has discovered since he took up Family History research. Cousin M in Kent said she had taken to wearing disposable gloves on the bus. Cousin B, a retired nurse in S Yorkshire, with her husband, is still clearing up after the February flooding (they live near Staithes). Their garage floor was under water in February but, unlike many of their neighbours, they did not have water over their doorstep. In more normal times, it would still be in the news but she says everybody has forgotten them. They are still cheerfully carrying on. Cousin R near Telford meanwhile complained they had spent a whole morning going round supermarkets, but finding all the shelves stripped bare. I have noticed sometimes when visiting other parts of the country, the difference in supermarket culture. In the West Midlands, shoppers go around grimly focussed on the job, oblivious of others. Around Bath, people are more relaxed, even exchanging jokes with strangers. In S Wales, the supermarket is a social venue! B asked cousin R if she could not find what she wanted in the small shops but she said they all disappeared long ago. Cousin S (West Midlands) said his neighbour was livid to find the local pharmacy had ‘more than doubled’ the price of a packet of paracetamol. S advised him to tell the local TV who would shame the shop for such blatant profiteering. You would expect pharmacists to be more public spirited. Another distant cousin near Wolverhampton was so desperate about the empty shops she was talking of going to relatives in Devon. Two (unconnected) friends in Wales had daughters/grand daughters working in Birmingham who were coming home for the same reason. Meanwhile Cousin R quoted a nursing friend in Birmingham who said their hospital was half empty, especially A&E departments. Could this be because the pubs and clubs were closed and the road traffic so much less, or could it be that people with minor complaints are simply avoiding hospitals? I read somewhere that the national death rate in India had dropped considerably in the pandemic, due to the reduction in road traffic in that country! Then we had disturbing news from Cousin M in Kent, who was unwell. Her daughter living a few miles away had had the virus, recovered, and gone back to work in London. The doctor advised going to A&E but M refused at first. Then an ambulance had to be called and arrived in record time. They found she had had a heart attack. The hospital was half empty. She was home a couple of days later feeling much better. However she overheard medical staff discussing asking her to sign a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ form. She told them in no uncertain terms that she had a husband and family to look after and she still had a life to live! We only heard all this later through cousin B, the ex-nurse, who warned my husband B ‘DO NOT SIGN ANY FORMS’! We do not know if some medical staff are personally keen to ‘write off’ the elderly, or if this is a discrete policy by some regional health authorities – not ours here in the South West, I am sure. Returning to the subject of panic buying at supermarkets, at the risk of sounding smug, I did not have any problems. Having lived most of our lives out of town, I always keep a good stock of essentials in case of winter snow, floods or other emergencies. It helps that we live in an older house with a good pantry and cupboard space. Our chest freezer, (back-up to the fridge freezer) packed up in January after many years, so we had just replaced it with a small new one, which is well stocked. Then the official Lock Down started. Everything went very quiet! There is a main road passing our gate and normally, by day, the traffic noise is continuous, but it became quiet as night. I normally spend my days rushing around from one thing to another, but with so much activity curtailed, I slowed down. Parkinson’s Law definitely holds! We could sit in the garden and listen to the birds, even a woodpecker drumming in the woods quarter of a mile away. B was dozing after lunch and awoke to find a Little Owl watching him from a tree! Unlike most owls, they often fly by day, but we very rarely see them. I do not know if the lack of traffic was the reason we saw so much wildlife in the garden, or simply because we had the time to sit in the sun (with the excuse that UV light kills viruses!). The garden was full of colour. You could hardly tread between the primroses on the front lawn. Violets and forget-me-knots were everywhere and then the trees burst into clouds of blossom, yellow or pink and white. We expect a bumper crop of apples this year that will break the branches of our ancient apple trees if we are not careful. I am sure the reason was the mild winter, followed by so much sunshine we have enjoyed from the beginning of March. Usually at this time of year, we are away holiday for two or three weeks, so we miss this most colourful time in our own garden. Whether it was due to the lack of road traffic or simply the unusual weather we saw lots of birds flying in the garden, we had butterflies and bees, hoverflies, bumblebees (3 different species) and a couple of hornets. Then jubilation, as ES lifted some builders’ rubble waiting to go to the tip and found two hedgehogs! We have not seen any for years. Then he looked closely at a makeshift pond he made and saw a newt. We found a toad in a weedy corner. A domestic goose appeared on the roadside verge and a passing motorist tried to catch it without success. I have no idea where it came from, but in the evening I saw it in the field next door. It looked happy but I did not give much for its chances. A fox regularly leaves his mark in our garden overnight. I went for a walk next day, half expecting to find a pile of feathers, but there was no trace. Our garden is not especially big, but gets rather neglected. By the time we normally return from holiday the weeds have taken hold. This year B and ES made a determined effort to cultivate some overgrown flower beds. ES, among other things, normally does odd-job gardening for a couple of friends. In the current situation, he was keen to cultivate ours instead, and grow vegetables and salad for home use. They even cleared out the old greenhouse, and ES went ‘over the top’ buying lots of seed packets and bags of compost. I considered what to do at home while locked down. I thought about spring cleaning, maybe turning out some cupboards but, my excuse, the council Refuse and Recycling services are struggling with staff shortages so I did not want to burden them with more, the Tip is closed and so are the charity shops. There are no Jumble Sales for local causes. Instead, I did some very inexpert gardening. At first, the traffic was very light. There were a lot of tractors – local farmers catching up on work delayed by the floods. A few delivery trucks and vans at first -these soon increased. Cyclists were making the most of the empty roads, and ES took the opportunity to go out himself. If anyone asked, he could say he was on Parish council business, but no one did. Motor cyclists soon discovered the empty roads meant they could roar past, well over the speed limit. Though the noise was disturbing, I could not see any great harm, but I think the police soon put a stop to their joy riding. The reason the police gave was that they were likely to crash and divert NHS resources. I would have thought accidents were more likely in heavy traffic than on these half empty roads. B often went out for a short walk (doctor’s orders) along the road to where a parking space leads to a popular path through the woods. One day he met a cheerful crew from the ‘Highways’. They had been sent to clear the drains blocked by the ‘cowboys’ who resurfaced the road last winter, but their machine broke. (I would have thought a pickaxe would have done the job but who am I to say?). They said it was so nice working by a (currently) quiet country road rather than their usual location dodging traffic on a busy motorway and so, with the sun shining, they were enjoying a picnic! B was just coming out of the woods on another day when a policeman on a motor bike ‘leapt out of the bushes’ and asked if he was local, B wearing gum boots at the time. He pointed to our house, just visible. The policeman turned his attention to two ‘harmless old ladies’ just getting out of a car, and told them to go back home. This seemed quite unnecessary. On another day however, B came home furious having passed, on a narrow stretch of path, a man in running kit, wearing headphones, who was ‘coughing and spluttering’. His girlfriend just behind was saying to someone on the phone ‘He’s not supposed to be out really’. On another occasion he met a girl who said she came from Bath and ‘could not see what all the fuss was about’. She thought the virus might be good thing, as it might ‘free up the housing market’ so they could buy somewhere to live!! I am afraid the situation has exposed some ‘inter-generational’ conflict, although it must be said, many younger people have reacted heroically in helping out. The sudden drop in road traffic has certainly improved air quality in town. Bath, lying in a hollow, is notorious for pollution. The council have just delayed their plans to introduce a Clean Air Zone, which had caused a lot of controversy, but was sorely needed. Now the decision has been put off. B used to spend time on his lap-top idly tracking civilian air traffic, now almost ceased. One intriguing aircraft trace on his screen however was a series of parallel lines, up and down along a rectangular stretch of the Welsh Border. He concluded that the Ordnance Survey must be making the most of the situation to carry out a mapping survey. In the first couple of weeks of lock-down, the sky was an intense blue. I thought at the time ‘the environmentalists will claim this is the effect of grounding all the airliners’. The cause was actually nothing of the kind. The atmospheric situation in the north Atlantic was an intense area of high pressure to the NW which brought us very clear, dry Polar air. The strong Spring sunshine made the air warmer at surface levels, but the humidity level was exceptionally low. My early career was in the Met Office so I automatically register such factors. Anticyclones are areas of descending air, coming down from high altitudes, (just like the air on a mountain summit). An article in ‘Weather’ magazine described a similar situation in January this year when the atmospheric pressure was the highest recorded since 1932 (and before that, 1902). The author included a photograph of intensely blue sky over his home in Berkshire. That occurred before all the aircraft were grounded. However ground level air pollution in towns has quite demonstrably improved with the reduction in road traffic. Meanwhile, a science programme on TV showing a satellite view of China had a distinct ‘hole’ in the air pollution over Wuhan. When the official lockdown started, ES took over the food shopping for the household. I never thought I would miss going to Sainsburys! It was a bit inconvenient to write out precise shopping lists. I felt sorry for him too, having to stand in a queue before he could go in, and then feeling he had to be quick to avoid holding up other people. Sometimes he spent rather more than I would have done but it could not be helped. He also did the weekend shopping at the Farm Shop and one day, I went as a passenger, sitting in his car. I had a pleasant half hour watching, and then sketching, the pigs in the field, happily wallowing in liquid mud, while he queued in a cold windy car park! With many shops now refusing to handle cash, I feel this is going to have repercussions in the way we shop, long after this current crisis. Ever since I qualified for a pension I have withdrawn my (partial) State pension in cash for the weekly shopping, which was a constraint on the amount I spent. I had to watch how much was left in my purse at end of the week. When you use card payment, it is easy to overspend. When the Blair government proposed to scrap the old Pension Book, some 20 years ago, there was an outcry because many pensioners did not have bank accounts and anyway, we wanted to continue to use our local Post Office. Our village WI (now sadly defunct) instructed me to write to our MP about it. Government quickly devised a Post Office Account with a bank cards so that we could continue to draw cash there. Now that all the major banks have Post Office links, and there are fewer pensioners without bank accounts, this system will soon end. I fear those pressing for a ‘cashless society’ will soon have won. But what happens when electronic banking fails or crashes through natural or malicious malfunctions? How would we contribute to one-off charity sales or buy a ‘Big Issue’? How would I collect our weekly Art Group subs? On one occasion recently I had filled up with petrol at the local garage and found a queue at the till. An embarrassed lady at the front was saying ‘But the Bank only issued that card to me yesterday’. It had crashed the system. The harassed attendant did not know what to do. However, I was able to pay cash, walking past the queue of impatient customers, and carry on my way. At the official lockdown, B and ES together tried to ‘lay down the law’ and confine me to the house. I took exception to this because a) I am in good shape, and age is no definition of fitness and b) I am not devoid of common sense. It is easy to avoid potential infection in our situation and I was not going to take any silly risks. For years, I have always washed my hands coming home from town, and before preparing foods. However, when they began their lectures, I considered hiding my car keys in case B took it into his head to ‘confiscate’ them! I did however, insist on regularly visiting our younger son YS, who lives in the village a mile away. He is disabled, with mobility problems, but very determinedly independent. Like me, he takes a more ‘laid back’ view of the risk. He has a 2-bed cottage and can park his car outside. He works part time in a city museum which is, of course, closed at present. He has long had a regular supermarket delivery slot. He does occasionally need some help however. His young Norfolk terrier has free access to the garden but he is overjoyed to be taken for walks and the regular dog-walker cannot come at present so I take him, on a lead, to the cricket field, or along a local footpath and occasionally meet friends for a brief, socially distanced chat. YS and dog also come to Sunday lunch every week and I strongly resist any suggestion that they should not continue to do so. It is difficult to avoid continuous news on TV. Whenever there is a big story the BBC news department can only be described as ‘wallowing in it’ – BREXIT, then the Election, and now this. You would think there was nothing else going on in the world. Moreover, the BBC news is persistently negative and critical. With the currents news it is hardly surprising that many more people are said to be having mental health problems when all we hear is ‘doom and gloom’. The local news, Points West, is rather better and more balanced but even that can hardly leave the subject of CORVID19, so I stopped listening to the TV news long ago. If I switch on, I put it on ‘mute’ until the weather forecast, the only useful thing since the local news was curtailed. We get a daily paper, not always the same one, and the local papers, which seem to represent a variety of viewpoints. There are always some who are carping and critical, constantly seeking scapegoats. In the current situation, the government is in a difficult position, balancing sometimes conflicting advice from medics and epidemiologists and from statisticians, not to mention the economists and all the other experts having their say from their own particular viewpoint. It would be amazing if, in the end, they had always got it right. Politicians all over the world are trying to deal with their own, slightly different problems, and every democratic government across the world is facing criticism from people who think they know better, or are arguing with the benefit of hindsight. If all these ‘armchair experts’ and journalists and commentators think they know better, why are they not standing for election and running the country? It is right that questions should be asked -that is democracy -but I am sick of those who are persistently negative and always think they know better. Organisations that have come in for particular criticism include the World Health Organisation but, like all UN organisations, it was always going to be in a difficult position. It does seem that the Chinese have a sinister influence. But then we received a ‘free’ 15 page newspaper in the post, called ‘Epoch News’ or something. It promised to be completely independent and truthful, written by ‘award winning journalists’ (aren’t they all?). Page after page of attacks on the Chinese regime, much of it the same things that I was saying at the beginning of this piece. However, I began to ‘smell a rat’, feeling that I was being manipulated. The sources, in small print, at the end, included the ‘New York Press Association’. I put it in the bin. Who can you believe? I think the best way is to consult as many different sources as possible. I do not subscribe to social media, or trust it for one moment, but there are many other news organisations. During lockdown, I have been wading, slowly, through a copy of John Simpson’s ‘Unreliable Sources’ -a history of news reporting in the UK in the 20th century. It shows all too clearly how newspapers and TV companies, the BBC included, have pushed their own (or their owners) political views – the Harmsworth dynasty, Beaverbrook, Rupert Murdoch and the heads of the BBC and ITV companies have all pushed their own viewpoints. Back in March (I am now writing in June) we were horrified by news pictures from Italy of victims lying coughing in hospital corridors, for lack of Intensive Care beds. We had also seen and wondered how the Chinese managed to build a brand new hospital from nothing in Wuhan. Anything they can do we can do too! You just have to ask the right people. The Army stepped in and in the space of days, had set up and equipped emergency isolation hospitals in converted buildings across the country. Only one so far has been needed. The other"

The things that make you feel ill, affect your ability to live your day to day life, that cause you pain or discomfort, or that may ultimately lead to your death. Your “wellbeing” is a much broader term in comparison, and in some ways more difficult to define, as it can encompass things like your emotional and mental health and how you’re feeling, as well as things such as if you’re getting enough sleep, do you have a healthy and varied diet and how active you are. Your health and wellbeing are closely interconnected and the ebbs and flows of the one can have a direct impact upon the other. So a cancer diagnosis, for instance, is a health concern, but it will also likely impact upon on your mental and emotional wellbeing as well. Or a poor diet may invariably result in health complaints, such as obesity or diabetes. When I think of “a healthy body”, the first five words or phrases that come to mind are illnessfree, fit, strong, slim and hard-work. Thereisn’t a particular person that comes to mind, but I would say it would probably be someone young, fit and healthy, with a lean, athletic body. Someone that watches what they eat and makes sure that they are moving their bodies regularly and often pushes their body in their pursuit of fitness. It is a body that is born not out of luck or good genes, but rather from drive, determination and self-control. And yet, as I am writing this and really reflecting on and interrogating my answer to this question, this doesn’t feel right to me. Rather this seems to me to be such an extreme way to visualise a healthy body. This almost obsessive control of how your body moves and how you ‘fuel’ it. A relationship defined by denial, domination and pushing your body to extremes. Of almost punishing it. Surely a healthy body is one that allows you to do and pursue the things that you want to do. A gentle, loving and reciprocal relationship of tending to the needs of your body so that you are able to fulfil your needs, wants and desires. Where the softness or hardness of your body isn’t a shorthand determination of whether it is healthy or not. So reflecting on this again, I would rather define “a healthy body” as one that is rested, nurtured, nourished, respected and loved. Identity How has my experience of health been shaped and influenced by my identity? For a start, my ethnicity is British and French. I was born and raised in Britain where we have the NHS. This has meant that I have had theprivilege of access to medical care, from when I was in my mother’s womb to adulthood (and hopefully beyond, depending on what our callous Conservative government does to it), largely completely free of charge. Any medical issues or concerns, I have been able to see a medical worker, which in itself is already a vast privilege that is far from available to everyone around the world, without any concerns of whether I can afford it or if I have the correct health insurance. I have never had to compromise my health or do without because of the cost of medical attention. As a child, I was immunised against various illnesses that could have severely or detrimentally affected my health, or even resulted in death. This again is not something that children living elsewhere necessarily have access to. Living during this global pandemic has also made me even more greatly appreciative and grateful for the privilege of our NHS. I am aware though, that not everyone receives the same treatment by our health system in the UK. As a woman, I have been through three pregnancies and labours. I remember one of my university lecturers saying that the effect of pregnancy and childbirth on a woman’s internal body was comparable to a car crash. Despite this staying vividly with me over the years, I never had any concerns that pregnancy or labour could result in me losing my life. This is, however, a very real risk for women giving birth in countries where there is no adequate access to medical care. It is also a very real threat for Black women, for instance, where they are four times more likely than white women to die in pregnancy or childbirth in the UK. This is just one specific example, but the reality is there are racial disparities, that can have fatal outcomes, in the medical care that Black and people of colour receive in the UK because of racial bias, prejudice and discrimination. As a white woman, my skin colour has never been a risk factor in the medical care that I receive. Indeed, I have white privilege because of it. An illustration of this is how the medical community centres whiteness. Last year a Black medical student in the UK produced a medical handbook of how symptoms, such as rashes, present different on Black and brown skin, as he noticed that much of the literature and clinical photos only focused on white bodies. As well as race, social class can also be a factor in disparities of healthcare across the UK. I would say that I grew up in a working class family. My father was a carpenter, working on building sites. He did not have a lot of job security and there were many periods of my childhood where he was between jobs and we struggled financially, although my parents protected us from these financial worries. One time our washing machine broke, so my uncle bought a new one for us. My great aunt would buy my brother and I new school shoes at the beginning of the school year. My mother supplemented my father’s wages by tutoring and teaching French, at home and at a local technical college. However, although working class, we were also fortunate. We lived in a semi-detached home, with its own large garden, near areas with large open green spaces. We had easy access to various shops and supermarkets, as well as our own vegetable patch and fruit and nut trees. We didn’t live in cramped housing in a built up inner city area, for instance, where some working class families live and where there are issues of higher pollution, a lack of outdoor space and limited food shops and which can lead to poor health outcomes. We were not financially affluent but my parents never had to worry about getting proper medical care for myself and my brother, from doctors, opticians and dentists, due to the NHS. My mother did go without dental and optician check ups, as these were not covered for adults. Now as an adult, my husband and I could be described as being middle class. We are financially comfortable, can pay prescription costs without any worries and both have dental cover, compared to my mother her sacrificed her own dental check ups. So there are many aspects of my identity where I hold privilege in terms of how they have influenced my experiences of health and wellbeing.   Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing  I’m not sure where and when I first became aware of the concepts of “health” and “wellbeing”. I’m sure that it most likelywould have been in a school environment, where knowledge about health and wellbeing were interwoven into the curriculum, where relevant. For instance, learning about the different food groups and the benefits of a healthy and varied diet in Science or Food Technology and the importance of being active in Biology and PE. I do remember some specific talks in secondary school around periods and sanitary products, as well as another on sexual health, which caused much mirth, embarrassment and silliness in a room full of teenagers. I don’t recall any conversations around health and wellbeing with my parents, however. It was they that were responsible for my health and wellbeing growing up, although essentially it was mainly my mother that looked after my day to day health. From looking after me when I was ill and booking doctors, dentist and optician appointments, to my daily vitamin and a rich and varied diet, supplemented by fresh produce from our vegetable garden and fruit and nut trees. She did it all, for all of us. Although we weren’t an especially sportyfamily, we were quite active. We spent countless hours of my childhood endlessly roaming vast antique fairs and car boot sales, wandering around air shows and picnicking at local beauty spots, especially our favourite Clumber Park. I was aware that my parents valued fresh air, sending us out into the garden once we were out of the coldness of the winter months as much as they could, or perhaps it was their way of trying to avoid the inevitable arguments between my brother and I if we were cooped up too long together. We spent many hours in our garden, playing on our swing and slide sets, exploring and hiding inside the middle of the vast overgrown bush at the very back of the garden, reading in the sunshine, and, as we got older, lending a hand to the gardening chores (weeding was definitely my least favourite!). I feel sorry for my children, with their small patch of grass that has to make do as a garden in our London suburb, compared to the lush and expansive garden of my childhood, filled with flowers, bushes, shrubs, trees, a vegetable patch and a vast array of other types of greenery. So my parents cultivated a family lifestyle that was healthy and active, rather than sitting down and having specific conversations around health and wellbeing.  And really, I think that is probably it for how I learnt about health and wellbeing growing up. It wasn’t really a topic that greatly interested me, and to be honest, it still doesn’t even now. So I never sought out information about it through books, magazines, or friends, outside of anything necessary for schoolwork. Key moments I suppose that it was in my early years at secondary school that I started to first become aware of changes happening to my body because of puberty, such as the development of breasts, the growing and darkening of hairs on my legs and underarms. I have a particular memory of sitting in the sports field we used for PE, and feeling embarrassed of the hairs on my exposed legs and trying to arrange myself in such a way as to hide them, whilst surreptitiously trying to see if the other girls in my class were shaving their legs yet, or not. Indeed, I think that embarrassment, awkwardness and insecurities characterised much of my experiences of those pivotal milestones of puberty and ‘becoming a woman’. Added to this, the extra pressure and anxiety of not wanting to be ‘left behind’ byyour friends, as you all developed at different stages and times, and it all made for one hot hormonal mess. Urgh, and teasing little brothers too! But it wasn’t all bad either. There was also a sense of feeling proud when I achieved a milestone and this growing sense of awareness that I was no longer a child.  The biggest milestone of puberty for me was most definitely, finally, getting my first period. I was feeling increasingly anxious and impatient to start my period, as one by one, it felt like all of my friends and the other girls in my class were already getting their periods. It was a common conversation and question amongst each other about whether you had had your period yet or not, and feeling jealous and not a little concerned to find out another friend had joined this ‘elite’ club that you were not yet a part of, and the embarrassment of having to admitthat no, I’ve still not had mine yet. I can remember trying to bluff that I didn’t even want my period yet, considering how much those that were menstruating complained of the pain. I don’t know if I sounded convincing or not, but my interrogator didn’t have anything to reply to my assertion. So it was with some relief, a little bit of pride, the realisation that there were things far more pleasant things to look forward to, and the anxiety of figuring out sanitary products and hoping that it was not obvious that I was using one, that I had my first period. I can’t recall if I confided in my friends or not that I had finally achieved that hallowed milestone. Likely I kept my precious secret to myself until the next time the conversation around periods started and the question was asked. I did rather shyly tell my mother and then was horrified when my father whispered to me later that day that he had heard of mynews, and then furiouslyhaving to pretend that I wasn’t bothered by this insensitive betrayal.    Smaller milestones in my journey through puberty were shaving my legs and getting my first bra, both of which my mother initiated and guided me through once she thought I was at the necessary age. My mother herself used an electric epilator, and so that was what she bought for me. I was quite used to seeing her using her epilator growing up, but when it was my turn to use one myself, it felt quite intimidating. It was this loud, whirling, scary thing and in the face of it I was terrified that it was going to hurt (it did) and maybe even rip myskin off (it didn’t). I was relieved when my first experience was over and pleased to no longer have to try and hide my legs with their downy hair but the epilator and I never became friends. It was so hideously noisy and it just drew attention to this private ritual of hair removal. I used to play music on my CD player whenever I used it to try and drown out its racket. Moving to a hall of residence when I started university quickly spelled the death of my epilator, as I was so super paranoid about the noise of it. I sought advice from one of my university friends and moved to much more discreet razors. As for my first bra, I think that was probably the most excruciatingly embarrassing experience of all. It was squeezed into one of our weekly grocery and household shopping trips into town, as we walked back down the highstreet after having purchased our fruit and veg at various stalls at the market, stopping off here and there at shops where needed. One of those stops being at the quite luridly named ‘Bumps and Boobs’, whose shop front was covered in lingerie. I wanted a big hole to just swallow me up as we made our way into the shop and I just desperately hoped that no one from school had seen me go in. Two older ladies did the fitting. They probably weren’t even that old but to me looked ancient, and the whole experience was just mortifying. Did I mention that my little brother was with us too? Even now I feel my cheeks getting red just thinking about it all. Goodness, puberty was not a fun experience, and I’m glad that these milestones are well behind me. I do hope though that they will ensure that I am sensitive and empathetic when my own children start to experience puberty. And I’m thankful that I still have a little while yet until then!        Growing older  I have to be honest in that health and wellbeing have not necessarily been things that have interested me, so there is little that I have actively done to maintain my health since I became responsible for my own health upon leaving home all those many years ago. I make most of the meals for myself and my family from scratch. Although I am aware that this can be healthier than some pre-prepared or frozen meals, for instance, this has not been because I’m trying to reduce or eliminate ‘harmful’ or ‘unhealthy’ ingredients. Rather, I grew up on home-cooked meals and also, as a mother to three small children, I enjoy the pockets of time all to myself that I get whilst cooking, happily catching up on my podcasts. We have ‘healthy’ meals but, with my French ancestry, I am also not afraid of using ‘naughty’ ingredients. I am not restrictive in how I approach food, probably as some form of rejection against my upbringing, where my mother was openly hyper controlling of not only of what she ate, but what she also allowed me to eat. There have been periods where I have participated in physical activity, such as running around campus with R and PE with Joe during the first lockdown, but these have been for a specific period of time and certainly nothing consistently over the years. So perhaps a kind of benign neglect in terms of my physical health. I would say, however, that since having my children, it has been more on my mind that I need to ensure that I’m healthy, so that I can be around for them as long as possible. I just need to put that into action more. I have been better at booking appointments for medical concerns for myself, although this has been more once my children have been a little older, as in the baby years I found it almost impossible to find the time to prioritise myself in that way. I also took great care of what I was eating during my pregnancies, eliminating foods that could be risky during pregnancy, most especially with my first child, and also took folic acid and pregnancy and breastfeeding supplements. In terms of maintaining my mental health, prior to becoming a mother, this wasn’t something that I ever really needed to intentionally take care of. I was able to pursue my hobbies and interests freely and my time outside of work was my own, which I happily spent with R. Becoming a mother, I went from being able to do more or less as I pleased, to suddenly being completely responsible for this adorable, precious and utterly helpless baby that relied on me for everything. To keep it safe and warm and loved. To feed, clothe and keep it clean. Everything. Those newborn day are magical, but they are also all consuming and I sacrificed so much of my own basic care and time to myself for my baby, doing nothing other than holding and caring for my darling bundle. Now a mama to three young children (two, five and six years old), my days have changed from the intensity of those newborn days, but there are a lot of demands on me from my family. I have many hobbies and interests, from taking photos of my kids, memory keeping, documenting my little family and our life, researching my family history, reading, and so on, which bring me much contentment and fulfilment. Time to myself is also immensely important for me, as an extreme introvert, in order to be able to recharge. I have learnt in my journey of motherhood that I need to be intentional in carving out time for myself to pursue and indulge in my passions and also to find time to myself, as much as I am able to within the midst of our busy everyday lives, and how vital this is to my mental health. I am very conscious that when I neglect my mental health, not only do I feel horrible, yucky and low, but that I am not my best self for my husband and our kiddos. I struggle to give them the emotional care that they need, if I myself am not filled up. This has been further reaffirmed to me during this global pandemic, where we have spent extended periods on top of each other all together at home, as well as multiple periods of home learning my bigger two children. I have had intense periods of suffering emotionally over this time, as I had literally no time to myself and didn’t have any time to indulge in my passions that help to fill me up. As I get older, I expect that I will become much more intentional about actively maintaining my health and wellbeing, however. I think that this is likely to be a natural consequence of getting older, as when you age you are increasingly more likely to experience health issues and your body is also not able to move or work in the same way as it perhaps did when you were younger. I think also that as you get older, you may start to lose the sense of invincibility and the assumption of a long life ahead of you, and so the maintaining and the prolonging of your health and life, as much as possible, becomes more important.  I don’t tend to seek out general information about health and wellbeing. Sometimes one of the podcasts that I listen to features an episode on the subject of health and wellbeing, such as the Guadian’s ‘Today In Focus’ podcast, or a news article may catch my eye, but otherwise these are not topics that I have a general interest in. When I was pregnant with my eldest and his newborn and baby months, I did intensely research every little thing pregnancy and babyhood, however. I read pregnancy and baby books, including one book that showed day by day how your baby was growing and developing in the womb, installed a pregnancy tracker app on my phone to track pregnancy symptoms and baby growth, signed up to any pregnancy and baby newsletter I came across (I especially loved the weekly pregnancy emails telling me what fruit or vegetable my growing little one was now the size of), researched the foods that I should avoid during the pregnancy and those that were touted as being beneficial, worried myself with miscarriage statistics, and so on. When he was born, I experienced crippling anxiety and selfdoubt and sought to counteract it through research. I would obsessively research online any tiny symptom or complaint that he had, look up tips and videos about latching on and breastfeeding, seek reassurance around co-sleeping and his unwillingness to sleep anywhere but on my chest, and research forthcoming milestones and developments. My mummy friends and L, our family friend who is also a midwife, were also constantly consulted and I was taking him to the health visitor every single week. I was a big ball of anxiety, compulsively researching to death anything to do with pregnancy and my precious little boy. Thankfully I slowly learnt to trust myself more and to just go with the flow of motherhood. My second and third pregnancies and newborn days were a lot less fraught and anxious and I didn’t feel the need to obsessively research every little thing. And this is how I am continuing in my motherhood journey. As long as my children are happy and healthy, that is the main thing. I only research specific ailments or symptoms that my children or myself are suffering from, such as the NHS website. Or alternatively, I just snap a photo and send it to my brother and his partner for advice, as they are both doctors. During this pandemic, especially at the beginning where I was particularly anxious, I did find myself obsessively researching, like I did during my first pregnancy, as way to try and alleviate my worries, as much as I could. I watched the daily Downing Street Press briefings, read news articles on the BBC News app and just generally kept myself up to date about the symptoms, the prevalence of the virus in the UK and globally, the vaccines and so on. Although still concerned, I am nowhere near as anxious as I was, but it still keep myself informed through news articles and my trusted ‘Today In Focus’ podcast.  There have been periods of my life when I have been intensely aware of my body and other periods where I have been less so. Where I have been super aware of my body has been during periods of great changes in my body, such as during puberty or pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, for instance, I adored my growing bump, which my hands would always gravitate towards resting on, and I was so in awe of and grateful for how my body was literally creating new life and how it was changing and adapting to accommodate this baby that I was growing, nurturing and protecting in my womb. And how this body then safely laboured and birthed my little ones and how I was able to feed and sustain them through the milk produced in my own breasts. These are periods where you cannot help but be profoundly aware of and full of gratitude for your body and its capabilities. Where as in this current period of my life, I have more of a niggling awareness of what my body is not, in terms of not quite in the shape I would wish for, I will always be forever grateful for what my body has done in terms of giving me my three precious children. Health, wellbeing and appearance  For myself, I believe that external appearance is separate to health and wellbeing, but I do think that there is a wider societal blurring of these concepts. For instance, vitamins and supplements, which although are products to help you to maintain your health, are also available for ‘healthier’ and ‘stronger’ hair and nails, for example. Or exercise routines to keep you fit but to also achieve a particular more desirable body shape (‘legs, bums and tums’ routines, I’m thinking of you). We live in a society and culture where beauty and physical appearance are heavily prized. The images that we see on the screen, advertisements and social media, for instance, are liberally airbrushed and faces expertly made up with make-up. Celebrities and people in the public eye are aware of how to pose or dress a certain way to create the illusion of having a perfect body. When we are constantly assaulted with these unrealistic distortions of female or male beauty, it is difficult not to feel that you are inadequate or ugly in comparison and there is a pressure to try and achieve these desired aesthetics. I myself struggle with feeling that I do not meet up to popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. I wish that I was prettier or that my skin was clearer. My body is softer and more generous than it has ever been, as a result of three pregnancies and a global pandemic where I have primarily spent the last year mostly within the confines of my home, which I have a lot of feelings of shame around. I shave my underarm and leg hair daily, and pluck and shape my eyebrows. As a teenager and young adult, I tried various cleansers and toners to try and ‘fix’ myspot prone skin, but when it didn’t result in the perfect skin I desperately wanted, I stopped taking care of my skin, as I felt it wasn’t taking care of me. This past year, I have learnt to look after my skin properly and get great contentment from my twice daily rituals of ‘cleanse, tone and moisturise’ of my skin. Although I’m not drawn to makeup, I always applyfoundation in the morning, regardless of if I’m going out or not. So there are certainly ways that I have internalised these societal ideals around beauty and physical beauty and how I act them out on my own body. I would struggle without my razor, tweezer, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, cleanser, toner, moisturiser, facial oil, foundation or concealer. I would not feel presentable and able to face the world without them. If I was deserted on a desert island, however, I could probably happily survive without most of these, provided that I was deserted by myself that is. If I could take only one beauty product, it would probably be a multipurpose product, such as Neal’s Yard Wild Rose Beauty Balm, which can be used as a cleanser, moisturiser, face mask, treat dryspot or bump and bruises, amongst many other things. It’s an amazing product and smells divine too! Although there are some beauty standards that I have internalised, I am also realistic with whom I am and what I look like and I, sometimes begrudgingly, accept that this is who I am. Although I may wish to be stunning and to have the perfect body, I also don’t want to manipulate my body and face through medical procedures, cosmetic injections, punishing fitness routines, excessive make up or so on. I think there needs to be a wider and more inclusive acceptance of beauty in all forms and more scrutiny and regulation of the manipulated beauty standards and images that we are constantly bombarded with daily.  As for my parents, it is hard to say how much, if at all, they have been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical experience, as this was not a topic that I can recall having any conversations with them about. I can say that my mother took care of her appearance, applying make-up and styling her hair, which was dyed, daily. She moisturised her face and body, and plucked and epilated her body hair. So these rituals could certainly be interpreted as acting out beauty ideals. I would say though that I think that both my parents valued a slim physique. My father would complain every so often that my mother was feeding him too much and making him fat (he wasn’t). They would both make critical remarks about friends, acquaintances or, even on some occasions, strangers, that they felt were overweight. My mother was extremely restrictive and obsessive about the foods that she ate. Often just a piece of toast, some cottage cheese and an apple. I was very familiar with the sight of my mother weighing herself. She was also vigilant in her policing of my weight and the amount of types of food that I was allowed to eat. I remember as a young child my grandmother indulging me with a biscuit and my mother refusing it on my behalf whilst withering declaring that I ate like a horse. I would only have been in primary school at the time. I hesitate, however, to lay my mother’s relationship with food and her body solely at the feet of beauty standards. For one reason because it was not something that I felt that I could really engage her in conversation about. For another, because I believe that she likely suffered from an eating disorder, which tend to also be about regaining some sort of control through your relationship with your body and food. Getting ready to leave the house  For most of my childhood, my mother tutored all ages, from young to old, in French from our dining room table. A couple of evenings a week she would also teach French at our local college. My father worked as a carpenter for various building firms. The ways that they got ready to leave the house for their respective jobs had their similarities and differences. They would be the donning of outdoor clothing, such as coats and shoes, but where as my mother would have got all her belongings, bags, teaching resources, etc that she needed ready, my father relied on my mother to prepare and get his bag, thermos of hot coffee and his lunch for him, with the exception of his tools, which he would get from the shed himself. We always locked our front door, and whoever would leave the house would also lock the door behind them or whoever was seeing them off would do so instead. If the house was going to be empty, my mother would be the one to set the house alarm. My rituals for leaving the house largely depend on the reason for venturing out, as well as if anybody will be with me or not. During this past year or so of the pandemic, I am mostly only leaving the house to take my children to their respective pre-school or school, or to pick them up. Otherwise, we are all mostly at home, and have only ventured out to the shops a handful of times since just before the first national lockdown, mostly relying on online deliveries. Whenever I am due to leave the house, I always make sure that I visit the bathroom first and then do a quick check in the bathroom mirror that I’m neat and presentable. Then it’s a case of putting on my outdoor shoes and coat, which are all stored in our porch, picking up a mask from the top of the shoe cabinet and locking the front door. If the house will be empty, I also activate the house alarm and home security camera systems. I’m ready and out of the door in next to no time. When it’s the school run, however, imagine a similar routine, but a million time more chaotic. I’m rushing around to fill up drinks bottles, fetching homework folders, reading books or whatever else needs to be handed in that particular day, getting out shoes, coats, as well as winter hats, scarfs, gloves, summer hats, etc depending on the season, repeatedly asking the children to put on their shoes and coats (which more often than not, ends up in me repeating myself over and over, getting increasingly louder and more frantic each time – the littlest, who is only two, gets a pass on this, with either myself or my husband getting her ready), and then finally resorting to putting on shoes and coats for them myself, all whilst getting myself ready."

COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” In early 2020 little did anyone imagine that the pandemic would be reshaping our lives in December 2021. My life has been radically reshaped, due to domestic circumstances because my husband is immunosuppressed and so he is particularly vulnerable. So despite lockdowns, the removal of restrictions on everyday life and the vaccination programme we continue to live a spatially and socially constrained life.  The vaccination programme has afforded many of us a degree of protection but not 100% . Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” The steady rise in energy bills is alarming. To be honest I hadn’t noticed it at first hand, but I am aware of energy providers in the deregulated market ceasing trading. Fuel poverty isn’t new but the sheer scale of fuel poverty must be enormous. In spring 2020 my energy provider ‘merged’ with another, and I was ‘transferred’. We rarely now use the car, but yesterday my husband filled up the car (75% to fill up) and it cost almost £60. For those using the cars daily it must put a strain on finances. . The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 For a number of years, I suppose since the ‘war’ in Afghanistan and the centenary anniversaries of the start and end of WW1 I was struck by a more visible articulation of support. . The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess was indeed shocking. I hadn’t even heard him before his murder – and the horror that the murder happened in a church hall where he was holding a surgery . The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn – Owen Paterson’s behaviour didn’t surprise me, what shocked me was the forceful ‘defence’ by the PM, and his instruction to the Conservative MPs to back Paterson, the defence of indefensible behaviour. .

We will be asking you about COP26 as one of the next Directive themes, so please hold your thoughts and opinions on this for now. In the third part of the Directive, we have made a list of events you might wish to write about: COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and “normality” Feeling incredibly grateful to live in a wealthy country that can afford boosters and has such a strong science sector. And also to all the 1000s of volunteers and NHS/social care staff who have made all this possible. I wish there was better leadership that would encourage people to think of each other more and to be positive about getting through, but not try to pretend that Covid will just go away. I hate the lack of a world effort to vaccinate everyone and I find, frankly, pathetic, the politicians who try to make out the UK is ‘world-beating’. The whole of humanity would have done a lot better with Covid working together, not setting up some ridiculous competition. It has been the hardest ever term in schools, and therefore hard in teacher training, and I am cross that there has not been enough support for teachers and enough recognition of the hardship in school. It has been easier to have face to face work possible again, but schools are still quite joyless places. As such, it is much harder to persuade trainees to stay with the course, there has been a bigger drop out than ever, of people thinking they wanted to teach, but then finding how hard it is and leaving. And people who already had mental health need are finding life even harder and so need much more pastoral support. While some online things will continue -quick meetings etc on Zoom -it is hard to explain how much better life feels being able to be face-to-face again. There is something really hard to explain about how interaction makes one feel better if it is in person; and a hollowness to days and days of Zoom. Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” We are already trying to reduce our energy consumption and wearing lots of jumpers. The cost of energy for so many people is going to be impossible. We will be OK -just have a bit less disposable income. I don’t know why there is still so much waste -eg, I walk through York after hours and all closed shops are brightly lit -why? What a waste! If there was some more private business energy saving in places like this it might help. We need to accelerate the provision of green energy and also the cutting of energy consumption. The costs should provide an incentive to do this -but that would require political leadership, and we don’t have it. The centenary of the red poppy. A show of support for the Armed Forces community since 1921 I have for many years worn a red poppy for remembrance and a white for peace. I am moving towards not wearing a red poppy because 1) of the virtue signalling that goes on with it now -eg people in public life having to wear one or be vilified; 2) the marketisation with brooches, bigger poppies etc; 3) the use of the poppy by people to support militarism. So, I am minded to stop wearing a red poppy. I do not want to support the Armed Forces -that was not the original intention of the red poppy. The murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess Such a terrible, terrible tragedy -what is there to say? I did not know of him and am so sad to hear of the loss of someone who was, obviously, a fantastic constituency MP, as well as a much loved person. We need MPs to be in their constituencies. I wish all MPs courage in the face of these threats and am grateful for their work, and the work of people who keep them safe. The conduct of MP Owen Paterson and Government U-turn Unsurprised. The corruption that is part of power was always likely to be right to the fore and exacerbated with Boris Johnson as leader. He is a sociopath and amoral. We desperately need the people, on all sides of the political spectrum, who are honest and decent, to assert themselves and to find a way to improve the quality of our politics. If it is true we get the politics we deserve -blimey, that’s sobering! The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York. He needs to step aside from royal life and all titles. He should be treated as anyone else ­subject to the law, innocent til proved guilty, if guilty then subject to the laws of the jurisdiction where he committed crimes."

At the beginning there was a sense of panic as well as a real awareness of the loss of liberty - the days seemed long as we were still on school/work bodyclocks and getting up early, but having little to do. I was unable to focus on anything for a while, work was impossible, I was just so distracted by the thought of our impending doom. I had to make sure my son was being adequately home schooled, and we did the Joe Wickes workouts for a few weeks, but soon lost interest. I was preparing lots of meals, giving every one salads for lunch and trying hard to make sure that we didn’t waste any food, as there were still shortages back then. I spent a huge amount of time on news websites looking for the latest updates on the situation. There was a lot of idly watching Netflix and arguing with people on Twitter. Our use of technology hasn’t really changed much as we are all very tech savvy anyway. My kids had to do their martial arts lessons over Zoom, but otherwise all is the same. We don’t have much family - just my Mum who lives nearby and who has visited us daily throughout lockdown. At the beginning she stood in the car port to talk to us 2 metres away, over time she started coming in to the garden, then the conservatory and then just into the house as normal. She took on my sons home schooling (she is a retired teacher) which was a massive relief for me.  I didn’t leave the house for a few weeks as I am in an increased category of risk and back then the media was still giving the impression that we were all going to catch it and die. My husband and I drank quite a lot in the evenings too. My teenage daughter who had her exams cancelled in the blink of an eye, started staying in bed all day and only getting up in the afternoons, staying up till 4am. My husband was working from home throughout the lockdown so he was at his desk for 9 every morning, but my son and I started getting up later and later, and I was able to sleep in till about 8 most mornings, then spending an hour on my phone before even getting up.  As always, I do all of the housework and cooking, which I hate doing, but all of my attempts to get the family to help failed miserably. My husband just works then wants to spend his time off relaxing, my kids have to be nagged to do anything and so it all falls to me. Its worse than normal because they are all home all the time, so instead of being able to tidy the house in the morning and it staying that way till they all come home, I now have to do it several times a day. The dishwasher is on at least 3 times a day now.  As time passed and the threat receded, I started spending more time getting stuff done that has been on my to-do list for some time. Scrapbooks, photos, tidying up hard drives etc. Still a lot of Netflix and Twitter, although I did take an extended break from Twitter with everyone going on about Dominic Cummings and his drive up north - you would think he had committed mass genocide the way they had carried on. I also quit drinking for 100 days, just because it was getting a bit too much - I was drinking brandy and not getting any impact from it, I felt like I was just poisoning myself. I started watching You Tube videos about the stock market and invested £100 in it, just to see how I would get on. There’s quite a thrill to it! I did a lot more gardening than normal, planting vegetables and herbs and fussing over my seedlings. My husband and son dug a pond for the garden and we have had a huge amount of pleasure watching the birds, hedgehogs and cats drink from it.  My boss had to stop paying me in May so I’m now unemployed, but I told him I would keep writing for him. I don’t qualify for the self-employed grant so our income is right down. I have however lost my motivation with the loss of payment, as well as the fact that it is visiting the places to write about that I enjoy so much, and we couldn’t go anywhere. It just reminded me of all my cancelled plans and made me sulk a lot.  When we were able to start meeting people again I went on a few dog walks with friends and could finally leave home. My son was asked by a teacher to get in touch with a school friend who was suffering from depression during the lockdown - because he lives near us they arranged to meet in the park every day at 12. I would walk round the park getting my exercise while they played on the swings etc, then my son and I would walk home together. It did give a structure to the day which we were sorely missing.  As soon as places to visit started opening their doors, I booked us a trip to Mottisfont at the end of June to see the roses. It wasn’t quite the same, being herded around and not allowed to go in the house, but we made the best of it. We went to Monkey World the other day but having to wear masks took away most of the enjoyment as a glasses wearer, as I just walked around in a fog. It cost £45 for all of us and didn’t really feel worth it.  My daughter started college last week and my son went back to school, and finally things feel like they are going back to normal. We have a routine and a structure, and I don’t have to make anyone lunch during the day or keep them entertained. I just need my husband to go back to work now and I will finally have the house to myself again - I’ve forgotten what its like. He’s here till the end of the year though. I like that we are getting back to normal, although I have found myself more of a homebody than I used to be. I like going out and once I’m out I love it, but it is harder to get myself out now than it used to be.  As for the seasons and noticing the changes - I’ve always been very aware of seasons and relish the changes between them. In the past week we have had my favourite change of them all - summer to winter - when although the days can still get hot, there is a crisp freshness in the air that you just don’t get at any other time. On the first day it happened, I spent most of the day gardening, just to be in it as much as I could. Lockdown hasn’t made any changes to my appreciation of the seasons or natural rhythms. I have got a bit more obsessed with my hedgehogs though, and now feed them every single night without fail - they now come scuttling across the garden when they hear us shake the jar. We have 5 that visit us or live in our garden - they’ve been with us for 20 years in their various generations.  We did also acquire lots of rats during lockdown who kept running into our garden for bird food. I was horrified at first, but grew to like them, they are very clean looking and really rather sweet, and I was impressed at the lengths they would go to to get to the food, however much I moved it around. They all seem to have gone now that lockdown is over. I think life will go back to exactly how it was before - I don’t think any lessons have been learned as humans from out time apart and where it could have been a time of great reflection and growth, we have all emerged far more selfish than before."

It is a sad situation that in Britain in 2021 that is a problem that people face. It seems especially harsh that because a great deal of people, me included, have been at home more over the last couple of years, we seem to be paying the price now. We always have the conversation about when we can last out to before we succumb and put the heating on. This must be a conversation that happens in households across the country. I feel very lucky that we do not have what I imagine the second half of this conversation is, namely how much of the food budget do we cut to pay for the heating. My father’s energy company was one of the ones that went bust. His bills have rocketed after he was “moved” to a new supplier. It is a cause for concern that people must find this extra money, through no fault of their own. Many people fix their tariffs, so they know exactly what they have to pay. But now, they have no choice in the matter, but have to pay extortionate bills to companies that always seem to come out smelling of roses. I think this event has a lot of links with the Kindness, spoken about in part 1. People and their needs should come first. People need reasonably priced, reliable energy. It is not a surprise that in a society that relies on foodbanks that energy is such an emotive issue. We need a new government!"

Both retired, my previous occupation was as an academic in science education. No children Part 3 UK events Covid. My husband and I were very keen to have our Booster jab and made appointment as soon as we could. Despite us being fully vaccinated we are still reticent about socialising and attending events. We very recently went to a brass band concert, anticipating all the audience wearing masks and social distancing encouraged. But there was no social distancing, and a full and very hot auditorium. Although the concert was very good, we left at the interval, mostly because of the crowd. The centenary of the red poppy completely passed me by. I think that was due to our (my husband and I) continued limited contact with others. I’m not surprised that many small energy companies have gone bust when energy prices leapt. As a society, we are encouraged to ‘buy the cheapest’ rather than look for quality and value for money. It seems the business models of some small energy companies were unsustainable – perhaps not surprising in a ‘private’ company market, rather than a public sector model. The murder of David Ames was absolutely shocking. It prompted the discussion from MPs about how much threat they feel under – I’m sure they get lots of ‘hate mail’ and online abuse but I would suspect most of it is from people, opposed to their policies, who would not engage in physical violence. However, because of the extreme religious views of the person who perpetrated the murder, I think there was also a backlash against Muslims immediately following the murder. It does seem as if knife crime, including murders of innocents, is rapidly increasing. It’s difficult to know how to stop it. Similarly the suicide bomber outside Liverpool women’s hospital – measures to stop such an act are very difficult. So shocking murders, such as Liverpool 12 year old stabbed by teenagers, hit the headlines for a day or two and will be succeeded by others. However, although such acts rightly promote an outpouring of shock and grief, the many everyday deaths by other means – illness, accident tend to be ignored by the media. Conduct of Owen Paterson and government U-turn. The whole episode really angers me. One rule for the PM, government and cronies; one rule for others. In particular, the 3-line whip on the proposal to change rules to benefit Owen Paterson, on pain of losing finance for the MP’s constituency is absolutely appalling. You can tell I have left-wing views! But even centrist Tories like Ken Clarke are arguing that Britain is turning into an elected dictatorship – I agree. I cannot see why ‘ordinary’ people cannot see through the extreme right-wing, and corrupt nature of the current government, and continue to have  positive views of the PM. The levelling-up agenda appears to be just a slogan, given the removal of finance for new and upgraded railway lines east-west in Yorkshire, with the PM claiming it is all wonderful news. The whole situation is very depressing and angering. I feel for my niece and nephew and their children (we have none of our own) – the current political situation, particularly the incompetence of the government over Brexit (whichever way you voted (and it won’t be a surprise that we were remainers)) will surely impact them more than us in our declining years.  I support The Good Law project which is trying to hold government to account, and I think would act regardless of the party in power. The legal route to complaining and action seems a good way to proceed – I’m not one to engage in demonstrations personally.  I’ve been reflecting a lot recently on the fact that most people seem to be able to get on with their everyday lives satisfactorily, even with financial and Covid hardships. So, can we live with lack of positives at national political level?? R7467 Autumn 2021 Directive/No. 123 Lawsuit related to Prince Andrew.

While staying the weekend with (and caring for) my 88-year-old mother, my husband contacted me on the Saturday morning to say he hasn’t been feeling very well and thought he might have had a temperature overnight. As a healthcare worker, he has been working throughout the pandemic, so my first thought was that he should be tested for Covid. This hasn’t occurred to him since he said that he hadn’t got a cough! However, he immediately accessed his home lateral flow testing kit (provided by the hospital) and to his surprise (but not mine!), it came back positive. He then referred himself for a PCR test, which was also positive. I was panic stricken: my immediate thought was for my 88-year-old mother (who has dementia and diabetes). What if I had picked up Covid from my husband and brought it to her home? Being 250 miles away, there wasn’t much I could do apart from panic! However I didn’t say anything to my mother, and booked a Covid test at the testing centre local to my home, on my return on the Sunday night, such that I was able to get a PCR test before meeting back up with my (now positive) husband. I attended a “drive-through” testing centre, and was impressed with the organisation and speed of the whole process. I was directed into a parking bay, asked to wind down my car window, and the tester took swabs from my nose and throat. The whole episode took less than 10 minutes. This test came back negative, so I had some degree of confidence that I hadn’t infected my mother with Covid, which was a massive relief. Fortunately, although my husband was clearly unwell for a few days, he had no complications from the infection, and made a full recovery, and I remained well. My husband reported his infection to the authorities, but at no point did I receive any notification from ‘Track and Trace’ . I self-isolated because I knew that was the right thing to do, but at no point did I receive any official notification that I should. It so happened that I had volunteered for a research study that included Covid antibody testing, and three days after my return from my mother the kit for the testing was delivered to my home. I quickly carried out the antibody test. This was a blood test, requiring me to prick my finger, add drops of blood to a piece of blotting paper and return it to the address provided. It was several weeks later that the result came through, reporting that I was antibody-positive, i.e. that I had been infected with COVID-19. However, my infection must have occurred prior to my husband is illness, since it takes a little while for covid antibodies to develop. What I guess I will never know is whether I passed Covid to my husband (although I had no trace of any symptoms in the couple of weeks prior to the fateful weekend) or whether I had contracted Covid sometime previously. I had had an episode of feeling mildly unwell followed by a short period of anosmia some nine months previously. It was just before lockdown started, and following six weeks of work related travel to destinations such as Hong Kong, Dubai, northern Italy, and Liverpool.   At the time, it didn’t seem to be an issue: it is only in retrospect that I wonder whether I was infected at that time. After lockdown started, I worked from home, going out only for exercise such as walks and cycle rides, and didn’t really mix at all with other people, so it’s hard to know where I might have picked up Covid if it wasn’t in those early days This wasn’t my first PCR test; I had taken part in the pilot population testing program, requiring me to self-swab four times over a two-week period, in the summer of 2020. The program was primarily aimed at testing students (I work at the University) and when students return to campus in autumn 2020, I volunteered to feedback to students who tested positive. They seem to take it in their stride, and for many, it wasn’t a surprise because they knew they’ve been in contact with someone who had tested positive or were experiencing mild symptoms. In the most part, classes were taking place remotely, so students isolating in their accommodation, were still able to take part in their education. I was also asked to take a PCR test in August 2021; I had had lunch with my daughter (a 27 year old nurse who had been fully immunised against Covid) and the following day she phoned me to tell me that she had a positive lateral flow test (followed by a positive PCR).  In contrast to my experience when my husband tested positive, I was contacted by track and trace, and asked to self-isolate. I was then recommended to take a further PCR test (despite being double vaccinated, and by this time having had three positive antibody tests) which I booked at the same testing venue as my December test. As before it was drive-through, and as before, it was well organised and I didn’t have to wait at all. However, this time I was required to do my own swabbing. The car windows were only permitted to be open a very small amount, to facilitate the passing of kit, and communication in the main, was via laminated cards with words on them. It was certainly a more impersonal and “remote” experience. I felt more confident about the testing procedure, when the swabs were taken by a trained operative, although perhaps from the testing site personnel’s point of view, my August experience was safer. After the third lockdown in spring 2021, my employers, and voluntary work organisers, required me to test for Covid using lateral flow tests. I’ve done 28 tests in all, and unsurprisingly all of them have been negative. Reflections on Testing I suppose this is where I have declared that I have had training in public health, so some of my views may be coloured by my perhaps greater understanding, although I have had no previous experience pandemics, as my public health activities have been related to non­infectious disease. Due to the fact that I was by fully vaccinated, and have had several positive antibody tests, I feel that on a personal level, regular Lateral flow testing was unnecessary for me. My attitude to that which I’ve had to undergo has been that it is a ‘box ticking’ exercise. My civic duty; something that I do because it’s what everyone is asked to do, and I should comply; as a public health professional, I should set an example. I have at no point expected the Lateral flow tests to be positive (and I’ve not been disappointed!).  But I do wonder at the costs involved; on a recent visit to Guernsey, I was required to purchase a box of five lateral flow tests for the sum of £25. Assuming that the charge was approximately what it cost, the lateral flow tests that I’ve carried out to date has probably cost the government about £150. I don’t know how many other people there are in my situation, or the cost of antibody testing, or the amount of profit that those contracted to provide lateral flow test kits are making, but it does start feeling like a bit of a waste of money. I’ve read some discussion that suggests a positive antibody test and a single vaccine provides very good protection from infection, but I assume a single ‘one size fits all’ approach is thought to be the most effective. But my public health training does make me question the efficacy of all this testing. Lateral flows tests are usually only positive when there is a large amount of the virus present, and therefore probably after the host (infected person) has already had the opportunity to spread the infection to others. Yet to make them more sensitive, would increase the number of false positives. On the other hand, PCR is very sensitive, and can remain positive even when the infected person has such a small amount of virus, that they are very unlikely to infect other people. Whether or not regular testing has limited the spread (over and above the protection associated with quarantining and immunisation) is something I have not seen any discussion of.  Whether that’s because there is no evidence or whether that’s because there has been no assessment, I am unclear."

This directive was written late May / early June 2020 and already in the UK there have been over 41,000 deaths with a daily death toll, which, whilst reducing slightly is still too high to consider reducing precautions. It is extremely concerning for everyone and at the time of writing this I am “shielding” which means that I must stay at home for 12 weeks, only going outdoors for exercise and keeping well away from crowded places. This is because I am asthmatic and therefore susceptible to contracting the virus in a more severe form. This has put added pressure on our household as I have two sons at home who are both classed as keyworkers. They are normally employed in the public transport industry; however, all the local authorities of Greater Manchester are working together to undertake any tasks that are needed. Therefore, they have been involved in activities outside of their usual ones, such as helping to set up the Nightingale Hospital in April and delivering PPE to hospitals across the region. Whilst we are all worried and are taking the utmost precautions, I do not feel that this has affected our mental health as a family. We are lucky in that my husband is fully retired and I work part time and have been able to work from home throughout the crisis. My employers closed our offices on 18th March (whilst I was on holiday) and almost all staff have been working from home consistently from this date. My employers have furloughed some staff with their full agreement, but this has not applied to my role. We have been provided with laptops at home plus any other equipment we need. Office furniture was offered to anyone who doesn’t have such facilities at home to work comfortably (i.e. desks and chairs). Before Covid 19, we had been moving towards laptops and hotdesking so the changes to cope with the crisis were partially in place. We have meetings via Microsoft Teams and have Skype to “chat” to colleagues. It is all working perfectly in the Department we are in and there have already been talks to suggest that we may never revert to all staff being in the office together after the crisis. On a personal level, I am very sociable and already used Facebook, Facetime, What’s App etc to keep up with family and friends, We live in Manchester and all my husband’s family are in Hampshire so we “speak” regularly via these applications and did so long before Covid. My cousin in Oxfordshire is very similar to me and sees the importance of maintaining contact throughout this crisis. She introduced me to Zoom and we have a family chat via this method every fortnight (which is more often than we would normally be in touch!) and this can involve up to seven households. I think this is something which will remain. I have set up other groups with friends and other branches of the family and again we are in touch just as often, if not more, than we would be without the crisis. I want to “learn” Twitter but haven’t done yet, but it is an objective for some spare time during this crisis. We are very lucky in that we don’t have any financial worries and we live in a house with a pleasant garden. We have a large allotment nearby where we can spend a lot of time and we grow a great deal of our own produce. The weather throughout the pandemic has been for the most part glorious and because we have been able to get out without the risk of meeting other people, we have been able to deal with the restrictions more easily than some. My husband has spent a great deal of time at the allotment, we have grown early crops (helped by the weather) that we may not otherwise have done. We have extended our allotment as a person wanted to give up some of theirs, so this has been a great use of time. I have set myself some targets for the time spent in lockdown, taking up writing on a more formal level (including applying to write for Mass Observation!) and pulling together our travel blogs so that we can have them made into photo books. I have a target of learning to crochet as I have never mastered this craft and have wanted to do so for many years. I am also knitting and sewing as we have another grandchild expected in October. Personally, although we have spent more money in Supermarkets as we are buying treats more often, buying a few more bottles of wine to compensate for not going out and buying far more baking ingredients than we would normally, I have not spent anything like the amount of money that I would have spent under normal circumstances. The reason being that we are not going out to lunch with friends, we are not travelling to Hampshire as we usually do on a monthly basis to see our family and grandchildren, we are not eating out as a couple or a family as we would normally. I have therefore used Amazon etc to send “cheer up” gifts to family and friends, sent books to our younger grandchildren and great-nephews. I found some little wooden heart shaped “pocket hugs” on the internet to send to older grandchildren, family and friends that I am missing. I have also sent postcards and written letters when I would normally pick up the phone or send an email but have continued to do that too. My Mum is 88, luckily very local and although my sister has been doing her shopping, I have been baking regularly (almost daily!) and taking something around as a treat. Her grandchildren have bought her jigsaws, been to see her (standing in her garden) and we are taking her the occasional meal. Because we feel that we are abiding by all the rules we have made sure that she gets out walking every day and, on some afternoons, she comes and sits in either my garden or my sisters garden and we have coffee and cake whilst maintaining social distancing. Mum has been very stoical throughout this, not complaining at all, she just wants to get out of the crisis in good health and with all her family intact, she enjoys TV, crosswords, sudoku and anything else that keeps her brain active and she is coping well. Whilst I feel anxious about my sons bringing the virus home and am paranoid about cleanliness in the home, washing their work clothes everyday as soon as they arrive home, including hi-vis jackets which would usually only be washed weekly, I also feel lucky that we can look after ourselves in this way. As I am not attending my workplace I have been in very casual clothes (including, I am afraid to say, Pyjamas on some of the early days!). Personal hygiene has not lapsed in any way as we are a whole household who love a bath rather than a shower, so a bath is now a daily, long, leisurely affair for all of us to kill some time at some point in the day. But other personal routines have lapsed, I can’t get to the hairdresser, so my hair is no longer “styled”, and I have not used my makeup bag for over two months! I am wearing the same clothes on a regular basis, just washing them and wearing again as I am not really going anywhere other than to the allotment and the local park to cycle or walk. My sleep patterns have altered as we all tend to go to bed earlier now than we would in normal times. My sons are probably not asleep but playing computer games with friends or chatting on social media which is a similar situation for my husband and me. We are probably on our phones far more than is healthy, chatting to friends, following the news, reading newspapers, reading books on my Kindle, following Facebook, texting etc. I have “enjoyed” Facebook, there have been interesting posts and challenges, I have been asked by friends to post photos that mean a lot to me either family wise or travel based, and for a bit of fun I was asked to share what influenced my taste in music. I have benefitted enormously from social media use to reduce any stresses that may exist. I have a general interest in history, particularly local and family history and have been researching this. I have posted some findings on Facebook to be seen by family and friends with photos and have had some positive responses which has been lovely. I have spent more time reading, downloading books to my kindle and am definitely watching less TV. The latest book that I have read was “Beyond Peterloo” charting the life of Elijah Dixon a local man who spent his life fighting for the rights of the poor. I have been baking, learning to crochet, knitting, sewing, walking, cycling. I have done some jobs that I have put off for some time (sorting out the loft!) and have a list of tasks still to be done. Decorating is on the list but has not started as the weather has been too good to stay indoors but if this was to change as the lockdown continues then we would start to decorate. I can see amongst my extended family and friends that it is more difficult for some of them. I have other friends and family who are furloughed, and some are on reduced incomes and are not finding it easy. My sister is home schooling her 13-year-old son, who isn’t enjoying being separated from his friends and is often playing up when he is asked to complete his schoolwork in the home environment. Although this sounds trivial, when it is day after day with a moody teenager it does take its toll. My sister’s employer isn’t stepping up to the mark to make working from home a viable option for some of the employees so at the current time she is taking sickness leave as she cannot leave her son for prolonged periods as no schoolwork would get done. Luckily, we live next door to each other, and she can talk to me and talk through any issues and is not as alone as she would otherwise be as a single parent. At the current time I am not aware of anyone who has needed medical or professional help. Covid 19 has widened my experience of friendships and how fragile they can become when faced with opposing opinions and/or mounting stress. I have kept in touch with many colleagues over the years despite our career paths changing. I made a friend in 1976 and have kept in touch at Christmas time and birthdays but since I took flexible retirement, we have seen much more of this couple and enjoyed many days out, lunches, evening meals, weekends away etc. M and his wife are staunch Tories and we are not, and we have previously had light-hearted banter about our respective politics which hasn’t until now affected our relationship. In our eyes (although never voiced) their politics are about “them” and how everything will affect “them”, whereas we see our beliefs to be more widely encompassing and view politics by how it will affect much more than just us. Now in their 70’s they have a nice lifestyle, but do not travel widely anymore because of health issues (diabetes). They have travelled in the past within Europe and once to Australia and New Zealand but never Asia as they “never fancied it”. They remarked when we were going to India on holiday (and about previous holidays we have had in Asia) that they couldn’t go to these countries because of the poor hygiene, spicy food and the violence of the people (??). They tend to believe safety is an issue simply because the people are poor. We have previously brushed off these comments with tales of our thoroughly positive experiences over ten years of Asian travel. However during this crisis our political beliefs being polar opposite brought on a situation that has caused the end of the friendship and I am still reeling with disbelief that in this day and age people can take such exception to the opinions of others. I now have a much greater understanding of how the actions of a few can cause a mutiny and how those few can very easily be ordinary people!. I have been saddened by this (but not to a point where I would want to resurrect a friendship which is clearly past its sell by date). M had been in touch with us during our holiday, via What’s App to say that “he hoped we had arrived OK in India and were safe” but again laboured the point “we wouldn’t have gone” and did we know “there had been a murder in Delhi ” which was 1,700 miles from where we were in Kerala!! We responded that there had probably been several murders in London, but he was, as relatively safe in , as we were in Kerala. Again, light-hearted banter but getting the point across. The next message was “hope you are still OK. Isn’t Boris doing a marvellous job?” a subject matter where he was fully aware that we may have an opposing view. So, I decided to ignore that one, and the next one, and then we came to a decision not to look at What’s App messages and to enjoy the rest of our holiday without the negativity and as we were travelling we really didn’t have the time to enter into pointless banter. I always blog our holidays on Facebook along with photos, for my Mum who loves to know what we are doing each day. Almost daily there were comments from M, not always positive, saying “we wouldn’t have done … ” whatever it was we had done that day or the day before … but always ending, “but we hope you are having a nice time”. Upon our return we scanned the queue of messages in What’s App which were mostly in the same vein about ”how great Boris was doing” and a welcome home one which said “I bet you are so relieved to be back from that place”. I really felt saddened that he didn’t understand the country at all but still felt it was OK to make derogatory comments and so felt I had to respond. My response included what precautions had been present in India, which I knew hadn’t applied in the UK, my opinions of what Boris was doing or more to the point what he had failed to do such as: block large events such as Cheltenham, attend several COBRA meetings, shake hands with people which belittled the severity of the crisis, procure PPE more effectively, provide adequate testing, report honestly on death tolls across care homes etc. I explained that we had felt safer in India and had felt the situation was being dealt with much more proactively there and now back in the UK we felt very anxious and unsafe. I received a response advising that he was “a loyal Tory” (which I think we had guessed!) and “patriotic to his country” and our opinions of “our wonderful country” were “disgusting and foul” and that forthwith he was “blocking us on Facebook” (at this point, my feelings were quite honestly, thank goodness!!). To cap it all, minutes after the blocking, he used the page of a mutual friend to say that he had had to BLOCK (in upper case, to emphasise the matter!) old friends “because of their politics in the current climate” and that they were “disgusting and foul”. I did write one final message and sent via email to advise that we were not disgusting and foul, as he well knew, or we wouldn’t have been friends for so long. I reminded him that we care about the wider community and the world (but managed to refrain from saying that in our eyes he didn’t) and I ended by saying I thought it was a sad to end a friendship because of politics but that we were happy to accept his decision and we wished them both well.  I was infuriated by the suggestion that we are disgusting, thinking this somewhat harsh as we are far from that and he knows as such. When it came into conversation once that we financially support, on a monthly basis, the education of a young girl in Sri Lanka who hopes to become a doctor but couldn’t afford to travel from her village to a place where she would get a better education in the city, he commented that we could have helped a UK cause. I doubt he would ever consider giving to a charitable cause that assists people outside the UK. Overall his comments were completely unfounded and initially it was upsetting to a degree. However, we are now of the opinion that his friendship is not much of a loss to our social lives and we can easily cope without the far right political banter. It has however made me more aware of how sensitive people can be and how they can have an allegiance to people in power that they put above family and friends. I find that bizarre. The Government – I think the political decisions have all been too little, too late and the handling of the pandemic abysmal in the extreme. When the severity of the virus was initially being recognised in early March 2020, we were on a three-week holiday touring Southern India. We had checked the Foreign Office information extensively before we left the UK at the end of February and there was no restriction on travel, so we left and had a wonderful holiday. This was marred only by what we were reading about “back home” and by wondering if we were going to get home easily and what we would be returning home to. We were extremely lucky that throughout our holiday we were getting information from our airline to confirm that our flights remained on schedule (while most around us were receiving cancelled flight information and were having to re-book). In India (the state of Kerala) the preventative measures in place were far superior to those our family and friends were reporting in the UK. We stayed in five hotels and on a houseboat whilst we were there and in every one, on arrival we had to complete a health questionnaire and sit in a Reception area and be observed for two hours before we were allowed to use the facilities and be shown to our rooms. One of our hosts explained afterwards that had we shown any symptoms of being unwell, coughing, temperature, etc we would have been immediately transferred to a quarantine hotel and had to remain there for 14 days. Supermarkets in India are obviously not on the scale of UK ones and are just large “corner shops” but only two people were allowed in at any time and there were washing facilities outside and hand sanitiser and you had to obey the rules. I was so impressed with what they were doing. At the time of writing this twelve weeks later, the UK is STILL not taking any similar actions regarding foreign visitors. Some quarantine measures will be introduced in the next few days but are so airy fairy and difficult to follow up that it is now almost pointless. We flew home from Kerala airport where the army were in charge, army officials took our temperature on arrival before entering the complex, the airport lounges were divided up so that no-one sat within three rows of seating of another person, and it “felt safe”. The army were present to monitor adherence (although I agree that we could have been asymptomatic and fell ill up to two weeks later) but at least they had policies in place, and these were without doubt encouraging sensible behaviour. In the UK press (The Guardian, 14 May 2020) the Indian state of Kerala had had 524 cases and only 4 deaths. The state spans over 15,000 sq. miles and has quite a dense population of 33 million. By comparison the whole of the UK has a population of 66 million and as at the same time the statistics stand at 237,000 cases of infection and 35,000 deaths with an admittance that the death toll is “probably much higher” as there is little clarity surrounding deaths in care homes. Our stopover at Abu Dhabi followed much of the same rules as in India but on reaching the UK there was absolutely nothing in place. We decided not to join the queues (as there no social distancing in place AT ALL) for passport control and sat and waited until the area was clear before going through passport control. I actually asked an immigration officer at Manchester what steps we needed to take now back in the UK and he very clearly told me that I had nothing to worry about and having flown in from India there was no requirement for quarantine. I totally accept that this pandemic would have been a challenge to any Government, and not rating Jeremy Corbyn it would have been an equal challenge to the opposition. Indeed, it has been to Governments across the world. However, the UK has unfortunately witnessed some catastrophic mistakes made by our cabinet led by Boris Johnson. I outlined these above as the high profile events taking place, missing five COBRA meetings, shaking hands, lack of PPE, testing inadequacies and the care homes issue and in my mind a lack of transparency when dealing with Scientists, SAGE, medical professionals and local councils. I think this is not now going unnoticed (thank goodness). Later in the month of May there was the Dominic Cummings fiasco, he ignored lockdown rules and travelled with his family to Durham and whilst stupid more than illegal it set a precedent that rules did not apply to all. I despair and feel a total lack of trust towards Boris Johnson and his Ministers and it is becoming clear that other leaders feel the same way. We are seeing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to follow suit in both the relaxation of lockdown and the decisions around children returning to school. Local Education Authorities in England are now deciding for themselves and not following guidance laid down by the Government. To be fair I also have decided not to follow any Government guidance as what I am doing, in my opinion, is safer than what is proposed. I do think and hope that Keir Starmer would make a much better leader than Boris Johnson and hope that at the next election he will have a chance. I am following the daily afternoon briefings. I have been frustrated by the inability of the speakers to answer some of the questions. I have also been frustrated by the questions that have been asked, many of which have been repetitive and futile. The Government cannot provide a response for every family scenario and there has to be some common sense applied but this has been made all the more difficult by the guidance which has been so open to interpretation and lacked clarity far more than it should have from the very beginning and the media whose behaviour and coverage of the crisis has been utterly dreadful. The news and updates should be open to all and there are subtitles but BSL should also be used to convey the message to those who need it. I cannot see, as this situation continues, that it will become anything other than a political point scoring exercise with compassion and the safety of the nation falling by the wayside. I recognise that the economy is hugely important and needs to start returning to some state of normality. I understand that BREXIT is an all consuming passion for this Government too but it is very clear that they cannot multi task and at the current time everything should be shelved until we have this virus under control and the deaths are minimal. Now is not the time to concentrate efforts on other agendas. I think Government reactions to advice need to be more timely and honest in respect of the virus, the R rate is still not under 1.0, we do not have a robust test, trace and isolate system. Boris Johnson is showing on a daily basis how out of his depth he is in a crisis, he does not have the integrity to hold down such a strategic post. His character is one of laziness, banter and slogans, arrogance, lies and deceit. What the Government needs at a time like this is accountability, integrity, honesty, compassion, credibility and commitment. Boris has none of these characteristics and there are now flaws and breakdowns within his own party when what should be happening is utilisation of the skills of all professionals, regardless of rank and party to address the crisis in which we find ourselves. I am very worried about how this will roll on and what will happen to the nation under such weak leadership, it is unprecedented."

Mass-Observer S7592 describes themself as female; age 63; married; 'Tech Sales, Translation'.;The Directive 'UK Events' was issued on 1 November 2021 and asked Mass-Observers for their opinions on recent events that had taken place in the UK, including 'COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, returning to work and 'normality''; 'rising energy bills and energy companies going 'bust''; 'the centenary of the red poppy'; 'the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess'; 'the conduct of MP Owen Paterson and government U-turn'; 'the lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, Duke of York'.","M-O Number S7592 /Female /63 /Married /Shoreham by Sea/Tech Sales, Translation Part 3: UK Events One of our aims is to capture contemporary events in the UK. We will be asking you about COP26 as one of the next Directive themes, so please hold your thoughts and opinions on this for now. In the third part of the Directive, we have made a list of events you might wish to write about: . COVID-19: boosters, restrictions, omicron So, just as we seemed to be getting out of it all, here comes omicron. Now, I am grateful to have had full complement of vaccines (2 + booster) but we all know that new variants are developing in places where the virus can thrive i.e. countries where few people are vaccinated. So we will always always now be getting bigger bolder stronger viruses coming in to this country from other areas. Restricting travel between countries is a very small part of how to deal with this. The bigger goal has to be to ensure that poorer countries are as vaccinated as we are. Without this, every winter will see a new variant and a new range of measures to counter it. . Number 10 parties There’s always been a ‘one rule for them’ mentality and the number ten Christmas parties are a great example of this. The contempt that Allegra Stratton particularly, showed for a country full of people doing their best, was shocking. . Rising energy bills and energy companies going “bust” What I learned from this was that I have literally no idea what an energy company does. My green energy company went bus. British Gas – presumably less green – took over. Nothing changed. Eggs still boiled, the central heating came on. How was the old energy greener than this energy? How can it have been cheaper? This is the opposite of the free market: I am paying different people for precisely the same item. How on earth can anyone go bust doing this? . The lawsuit involving HRH Prince Andrew, The Duke of York. So, first of all here, I am going to take issue with how you describe this. It’s a lawsuit about horrific, sustained sexual exploitation of a series of under-age women. Let’s hope HRH wasn’t actually involved, but let’s also be realistic. Epstein and his pals did what they did and knew they could get away with it. If you didn’t want to hang out with, fondle and have sex with very young women, then Epstein was not a person to hang out with. I mean, they called his private jet ‘the Lolita Express’. So even if HRH is ‘innocent’, this is just a legal victory. He knew, he had to know. These women were sometimes broken already, coming from homes that didn’t know a lot about love. They were very very young. Had they not been abused by Epstein and his pals, they might have found love and happiness. M-O Number S7592 /Female /63 /Married /Shoreham by Sea/Tech Sales, Translation . The murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes I’ve added this in. There was so much shock and anger about this. This child spoke to us all. We heard him cry out “Nobody loves me” and his torn, tragic cry made me think of Jesus on the cross “Why hast thou forsaken me?” (I’m an atheist, but brought up a Catholic. These stories are with me forever.) Arthur knew he deserved love. He roared his need for love and he was ignored by all the people who could have, should have, loved him. I’m horrified by them: his step mother, his father. And I wonder who were they? What horrible chain of life leads you to be a woman who will kill a child? What life makes you a father who will say ‘Just end him’. Please take some time to comment on any of these subjects, or on any other items from the news, which you feel we should be covering at this time. We want to hear your opinions, along with details about conversations you have had, or stories and experiences and reactions to reports in the press."

Female, age 59, married . Kingsdon, Somerset . Former public sector middle manager, and historical photo web platform founder Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? I loathe the phrase ‘health and wellbeing’ two words that when joined together bring to mind (for me) an entire industry of lip-service and buck-passing by employers, business and government. I hope that eventually it will lead to better working conditions and genuine interest in individuals, but so far, I see it as a label that is symptomatic of doing less, but making far more noise about it. For example, my former large employer made their well-respected and experienced welfare officer redundant and replaced them with a phone line to some random company. Nobody wanted to talk to strangers so some staff took courses in counselling off their own bat and offered support to colleagues in their own time. Spotting that, the company then promoted their activities as a new wellbeing initiative. I think the limit of their interest was for Human Resources staff to take it in turns to sit on a sofa under a banner saying ‘let’s talk’ during mental health week. As that was in public, in the canteen, no one wanted to be seen to join them on the sofa. But still, they ticked a wellbeing box and they had a nice photo for the recruitment literature. The same employer used to regularly offer workplace health checks for blood pressure, weight, cholesterol etc which sometimes resulted in individuals being referred on to their doctor. Those have ceased too and been replaced with a (compulsory download) company ‘Lifeworks’ App that just reminds us to get these checks done regularly via the NHS. When staff are sick the manager now rings to check on their wellbeing. That sounds nice, but it generally isn’t. The few wellbeing calls I had would start off with ‘how are you’ (concerned voice), but move on to (disappointed voice) that I was not picking up emails. And then move on again to engage me in conversation about various work projects. I was left feeling sufficiently guilty to log in and look after ‘just the urgent’ things while I was really very unwell. The other thing they did during Covid team online meetings was to start off by asking each person how they felt. Obviously, everyone just said ‘fine’, because who is going to tell 10 people on a Zoom call that they are not OK. So, my experience of the rise of ‘Health and Wellbeing’ at work has not been positive. Health and Wellbeing also crops up with regularity in my social feed and in advertising. There seems to be no end of apps promising that they will dramatically improve my health and well-being, either through online exercise routines (first few sessions free) or to help me manage my mental health in various original ways (in-app purchases).  The key word in these seems to be ‘You’ and what ‘you’ can do to improve your own health and wellbeing. It all feels a bit like ‘go cure yourself’ which if it doesn’t work for physicians is not going to work for the general public. The advice given before is often extremely patronising (tips for a good night’s sleep anyone?). They are also (despite using a lot of words like ‘quick’ and ‘five minute’) surprisingly time-consuming. Having invested effort following the self-help path recommended it leaves you to feel a bit of a failure if the problems still remain. I have tried a few, including some quite original ones that I thought looked interesting (NHS audio tracks for a positive mindset) but now I can’t be bothered with them because they suck a lot of time out of the day and just serve to keep you focused inwards when being outward looking might be a bit more helpful. What would actually help is what wealthy people get i.e. quick access to a professional diagnosis and appropriate expert advice to get their health and well-being back on track. Because in many cases the dire effect on someone’s wellbeing is simply that, for example, they are hard up and can’t sleep for worry about how to pay the mortgage, rent or credit card bill. The biggest improvements for the largest number of people nationally would be schemes to help people avoid debt, or get out of debt. Being very hard up is OK for a short while, but it eats away at you the longer it goes on and induces feelings of constant low-level panic, helplessness and defeat. It makes people depressed because they can’t solve it and feel they must be at fault. Sometimes they maybe partially to blame, but everyone who has been poor for a long time will identify with the need, not just for survival, but to have some joy in your life that, for example having an unaffordable holiday will bring. When someone is a carer everyone acknowledges they need a break from the relentlessness of their day – well feeling perennially poor is something people also sometimes need a break from and they need this to help their wellbeing more than any medication or advice. I sometimes wonder if all the money spent on health and well-being was just given to people instead whether that would give a more positive response. After all a surprise £20 in the post would a rather nice present that would cheer people up no end. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Fit, young, slim, perfect, intelligent Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. A 20 something young woman in peak of physical fitness. For some reason the image I see also has long glossy hair, but it does not look like they wear (or need to wear) any make up. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Gender has only been an influence when seeking contraceptive and ante-natal services.  Notice I say ante-natal as my experience was that once the baby arrived all interest was lost in my own health, the focus being entirely on the new little one. A bit dispiriting as you just feel like an empty shell that has served its purpose and is no longer worth anyone paying attention to. I hope that’s improved in the 25 years since my last baby. I don’t think social class has had an impact on my health and wellbeing, the main connection with health and social class is linked with money and ability to pay for better care not with social class. The upper-class poor (I suppose there are some) experience of health would probably be the same as mine. Similarly, the experience of newly rich working-class people will be to afford much better care. That can seem a revelation if they have only used the NHS until they were better off. For example, for a few years we could not get an NHS dentist at all. None to be had. We went private as there was no choice. At the first appointment the dentist talked about ‘having a long-term plan to improving the presentation of my teeth’ What! In my experience dentists simply looked to solve any problems with decay, not to actually make teeth look better than before. Plus, it was all very relaxed and the receptionists were very smiley and nothing was too much trouble. My NHS dentist had photos of the inside of children’s mouths with terrible decay to look at while you waited on ancient chairs in a corridor. The private one was all plus sofa’s with art on the wall and glossy magazines. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? My mother had lots of books about health (or rather illness – you looked things up if you were feeling unwell not otherwise) plus books on childcare. They were hidden away, but we read them from cover to cover anyway as we had already read everything else in the house. There did not seem to be any focus on ‘wellbeing’. If you were well there was no problem was there!  I was aware of books like ‘How to make friends and influence people’ but the main focus on what people might term well-being now was in articles in women’s magazines. Along with the recipes, creative projects, child care advice and house hold tips there were always features about health and wellbeing.  Some of them had scissor markings to show how they could be cut out before your children might get hold of the magazine.  Mum always did that immediately, much to our disappointment. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Mainly my mother, but also the school nurse and local doctor Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? I remember being taken out into the back garden for a talk by my mother (with a book) after I had insisted to my older sister that babies came out of your bellybutton (well what else could it be for?). I think we went into the garden to get away from other members of the family. Also, I remember being very embarrassed when I had a strange thing happen to my toe. I was very afraid and thought I might be dying, but the rest of the family laughed. (I had never seen a blister before). Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? School was a big source of health information. Vaccinations at school happened regularly and at secondary school there were talks on drugs, smoking, alcohol and so on. At junior schools we had people come in and tell us how to clean our teeth and of course there was the school nurse. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I was very thin so a later developer and it seemed that all my friends were going through puberty before me.  Bras were a problem as you have that stage where breasts are showing but a bra is not needed and I just went very round-shouldered trying to hide what was happening. Then I realised I was going to be flat-chested whatever. My solution was to grow my hair to cover my breasts; it took ages. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? First period for a girl is life-changing. For my own daughter I wanted it to be a more positive experience than mine so at the first weekend of her period I took her out and bought her new undies, some beauty things like tweezers and a mirror, a little bag to hide her pads in for school and hair accessories, as well as a supply of different sorts of pads to try.  We also talked about how to manage a sudden period and tried to answer her questions. But mainly to try and make it a bit of a celebration of womanhood. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I vividly remember my first period. It was a lot more painful and messy than expected, but with an older sister it was not a surprise. I just thought it was so unfair girls had to have them.  My mother must have had lighter ones as she never bought me enough pads and I felt it was my fault that I kept running out. A period always seemed shrouded in a sense of shame. Our pads were burnt on the fire (when the men were not around) or put in the dustbin in the summer (wrapped in newspaper and hidden under other things). I was given second-hand teen bras from my sister, One with pink flowers and one blue. Hated them. I had no further help from my mum about buying bras or transitioning into an adult. It was not deliberate, but just assumed I would ask if there was a problem, which I never felt I could do. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I was never sport as I was so lanky and clumsy and I even failed to learn to swim during school lessons. In the end I taught myself breast stroke by going to the pool in the evenings once I was working and always enjoy a swim. At times I would go weekly but we now live quite a long way from a public pool which seemed very run down and grubby when I tried it. Also, public pools are so busy. I do walk and try to do steps, but that is a bit depressing as the recommended 10,000 steps takes at least an hour and a half. So, unless your job involves walking how is anyone supposed to fit that in everyday? I have only done it a few times when I was on my feet all day. I liked Tai Chi but the classes have now moved to another venue. I was all set to join them again until Covid. I have a couple of health conditions that do make exercise important. One is osteoporosis and the other is pelvic prolapse. I have just had an operation for the latter and am doing daily physio for core body strength, but will never be able to do some movements in keep fit without risk of a recurrence. I have developed my own daily routine that takes about 10 minutes mixing some Tai Chi moves with weights I can safely handle for upper body. I also do lower leg and ankle strengthening exercise every day following a broken ankle. Plus, a 20-minute fresh air walk. So, in short, I do what I can in a self-directed way and am looking forward to re-joining a class. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Dr Internet provides me with most of what I want to know, although I am very happy to hear from experts in person and wish there was someone, I saw on a regular basis so that it would be easier to ask about doubts and worries. My ideal set-up would be to have an annual contact with someone who would say ‘Is there anything else at all that’s bothering you?’ and has 10 minutes to spare to give what I say attention. Often people have little health worries that do need a professional eye, but seem too small to bother a doctor with for an appointment.  For example, my experience of asking a doctor to look at a mole was first a totally dismissive (more or less ‘stop wasting my time’) but at second attempt with another doctor he got out his magnifying glass and had a close look. He said it was a type that should be monitored (I knew that from reading health advice) so measured it and recorded that with strict instructions to come back if it changed so that it would be compared with the baseline just taken. Online I read the academic papers and journals if I can get access and one or two reputable websites. That includes the NHS and hospital information leaflets online, but they tend to be a bit general. Once I have a diagnosis, I refer to the NICE pathways which are useful so that you can understand what might happen next and also what the doctor is on about. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? About the same awareness now as always, but there is more information to read now. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? My parents seemed to be continually on a medical pathway of some sort once they were retired. Their entire lives revolved around appointments for doctor, hospital and medical related services.  I would like to avoid that for as long as possible because nothing seemed joined up and they never seemed to get signed off from anything, just to gather more appointments for various clinics. I have not thought about how my own approach to health and wellbeing might change in the future, but I would like to avoid that over-medically managed type of life. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to appearance, but are not the only factors. I know some very unwell people and some who deal with terrifying mental health issues that take them to the brink of a breakdown but who look really together. They take great care to mask their issues by paying careful attention to their appearance. Other people may be perfectly well, but don’t prioritise putting effort into their appearance.  It does take effort to be well-groomed, neat and tidy and an ill person will find it harder.  However, making that effort can actually make you feel better too, there is a symbiotic relationship. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? We are all influenced by the popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance (even should we scorn that we are). Even the most unfashionable person looking back at photos of themselves will see that they still look like they belonged to that era through hairstyles and clothing, not least because you can only buy what is in the shops and fashionable colours and styles come and go.  We are now in the mustard colour and eyebrows era. I’ve never wanted to look like one particular person, but definitely mourned my misfortune of not having the ‘bee-stung’ lips that were so idealised when I was younger. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? They tried to be reasonably fashionable, but clothes were bought on the basis they would last and be practical, they would never buy shoddy to get a quick win for appearance sake. They would aim for smart rather than fashionable in a popular way. When Mum wanted to be more adventurous, she would make clothes herself and was constantly doing so. As children we had some quite ‘out­there’ clothes she had made as it was cheap to do for children who needed far less material, especially in an era of short skirts. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? My desert island item would be Vaseline, to use for lips but any other dry skin too. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Dad was away in the navy so I didn’t used to see him getting ready. Mum didn’t work while we were small. Getting ready to go out together was a rare occasion. We did not see them get ready but Mum would be preceded down the stairs by gorgeous orange smelling Aqua Manda perfume. Dad of course was ready first and waiting in the hall. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? When young and up to even late twenties I would sometimes try on several things before settling on what to wear even for work that day. I was short of money for clothes and simply never had enough so problem I had was trying to make the same clothes look a bit different by swapping tops and skirts about or adding a jacket. I would raid summer clothes for winter by adding thick petticoat and tights and jacket, or swelter in a winter skirt with a summer top. I can quite understand the attraction of Primark for really cheap clothes nowadays, for young people on limited means they offer up to the minute fashion for not a lot. Clothes were much more expensive when I was young, you can buy a skirt now for less than I had to pay when I earned a 10th of my present income. Hair used to take ages too as I used curling tongs to get a flick in my longish hair or would put it up according to what the fashion was.  I always used to wear mascara and didn’t feel dressed without it. It gave me no problem even though formulas were less good then. But suddenly I found I could not wear it at all without it irritating my eyes and after buying lots of different ones I had to give it up. Eyelash tongs were then my thing but at crack of dawn got more and more tiresome to do and they now languish in the drawer. Now I have a wardrobe built up over the years there are pieces I can pull out from long ago that are now back in fashion, or never went out, or I will buy for an occasion. Plus, fashion is less restrictive. Once if your skirt was the wrong length you stuck out like a sore thumb, now hemlines can be of any length and wearing something vintage is like virtue signalling your green credentials.  I no longer spend much time on my (short) hair. Moving to a rural area has also made a difference. People in the market town don’t dress up to go shopping like we did in our previous urban area.  It would not be unusual to see someone in wellies. Around the village it would be laughable to wear anything else apart from trainers, low heel boots or wellies or sensible sturdy sandals in the summer. Teetering along the lane in heels just looks hilarious, and marks out townies down for the weekend. Preparation for going out into the village takes almost no time (put on footwear, grab a coat), shopping locally takes little more time. Work prep takes more time. Going to London feels like another country and if you don’t want to look like a country mouse it takes much more work. Covid has changed us in terms of make-up (no point in lipstick) and jewellery.  Wearing earrings is a nuisance with having to loop a mask around your ears and rings are equally annoying when you have to keep sanitising your hands.  Before Covid I would never go out without earrings, didn’t feel dressed otherwise and my engagement ring never left my hand. Presently all my jewellery is just going dull from misuse."

It’s weird getting used to these really long mornings, no job to go to... so eating is a good way to stay healthy and occupy myself. Two eggs, halloumi, avocado and sourdough... what a modern breakfast! Out in the countryside in Gloucestershire we are a little isolated. Although we have had corona cases in the area, it doesn’t feel like we are under immediate threat... ...maybe that’s why there was a party in the woods last weekend, at 40 i am way too old and sensible to go but you could hear teens and twenty somethings really letting go and despite the dangers, I don’t blame them. All those hormones, all that life to live and they are told to stay home, thats only going to last a short amount of time before they all pop. Unfortunately I had my own pop today. I have a friend staying with me, she’s sort of a corona virus refugee stuck between places and not sure where to go. She was here before the outbreak and hasn’t left. If she cooked and cleaned she could stay as long as she liked but she’s allergic to washing up (not actually but in the sense that she never does it) and lets good food that she’s brought rot in the fridge (a sin to me) and I today I have just had enough of her staying with me, so I asked her to see if she could live with someone else for a bit. It’s when those teeny tiny little things build up and start to annoy you that you know you need a change or get some space... it’s time. I have to say however that it’s been great to have someone around during lockdown but it’s really intense and now I’m just not sure I can do it any more. It’s not like family or a partner who you can argue with, it’s a friend. We have done really well living together so far but the washing up, the mess, having someone else experiencing depression and anxiety whilst you are too is really hard... Obviously not as hard as the health care workers who are putting themselves in danger to help sick, old and vulnerable people... but you know... it’s hard sharing a space with someone. I think the thing I miss most is music, my friend doesn’t want to listen to music or watch tv... this is incredibly hard for me as they are two of my favourite things. In particular not wanting to listen to music is like a punishment, I miss it so much and when I’ve had the radio on and a track comes on which I like, I try to relax but am always interrupted by a sad “I hate this song, who would have written such a load of ****”... it sort of ruins the moment. I think the key to surviving this lockdown is team work. We don’t work as a team, my friend is a little stuck in her own head to do that so our little home situation is breaking down. Those who do work as a team will be stronger by the end of this but I am positive there will be many arguments along the way. So, how have we done almost two months of this already without killing each other? Walking, walking, walking. I have broken the rules ever single day of lockdown by walking for over an hour. I never see anyone so don’t feel bad, it’s not like a London park. I can cover 8 miles and see no other human, it’s a lifesaver! Today was no different, after having a little tiff with my friend I walked for 4 hours. It helped me register my feelings and calm down and see what I needed to do more clearly. Those walks are precious, I have been watching the flowers change and the swallows arrived a few days ago bringing their summer song and that lifts the heart in a really valuable way. We wanted Boris to announce something clear and useful on Sunday but it seems like they are doing headlines and then writing policy and directions after which they put on the gov website. It didn’t help us work out what we are going to do but at least garden centres are open again soon, I need a tomato grow bag for my toms. I am actually going to work tomorrow for a few weeks on a garden. We arranged it last week and I can’t be happier. I can work alone and away from others so maintaining social distancing but finally I can earn some desperately needed money, my account is almost dry and I have to say, I’m a good saver but it’s all gone. Gulp. The bills however keep coming so anything, any money is really going to help. And maybe working will make home-life easier, it gives us a break from each other and takes the strain off my financial worries but will it be enough? I have no guarantee of work in the future and as a self-employed gardener I hope clients still want to spend on that aspect of their life. The problem I have found is that people are now at home and they have all discovered the joys of horticulture this puts me out of work, but hopefully this will change as people get busy again. So to the future, it seems mad to even think on it. If I am a fantasist I would say this is all going to work out well and in the end we will have a greener, cleaner future and become more self sufficient as a country. I am in fact a realist and if I was to describe the future I see facing us it will make everyone sad, the people suffering now and who will continue to suffer for many years after this are the poor. They are the poor from every country in the world and they will take the full force of the blow from corona and the rich, well, they just had a nice holiday. Note to self -do not dwell on the future.

So far it’s been more of a case of “What are we allowed to do?  Can we go out?  If so, how far?” We know we must keep away from other people, but that’s not always possible.  This morning I had to go to the Pharmacy to collect my prescription, and there were several other people all standing waiting for theirs, so it wasn’t easy to keep as far away from them as the guidelines insist we should.  Two metres (6 feet) apart is hard to do! The main problem at the moment, though, I think, seems to be the difficulty of getting food and other essentials! It’s all very well the government asking people not to panic-buy, but all the rhetoric coming out of the News and social media, let alone the PM’s daily appearances flanked by his two medical experts, makes people think things are going to get a whole lot worse before they get better, and if such items as loo rolls, eggs, pasta etc. are going to scarce, then maybe it’s sensible to buy more than one, or one pack, if you happen to see them on the shelves. Normally I do one or two smallish shops a week, with perhaps a big one every couple of weeks, but that’s had to change.  I really prefer going to the supermarket to choose my own shopping, but it looks as though I'm going to have to do my shopping online for the time being, at least. At the moment if I do go to the supermarket I feel guilty about buying almost anything in case it leaves less for others, but we don’t know what others are going to want or need, and besides, you can’t think like that all the time!  It’s a good thing that supermarkets have now made the decision to limit the number of any one item that people can buy in store, so hopefully that will make a difference.  I find it very interesting that Italy, which currently has the virus a great deal worse than we have, has no problem with people buying more than they need.  How come they are so much less selfish over there?  Yesterday on television we saw a woman in the Home Counties carrying two great packs of loo rolls out of the supermarket, but she turned to the cameras and said “It’s all right, they’re not for me, I’m doing shopping for two elderly neighbours and I thought they might need them, so I got them a pack each.” She was probably right, and doing her “good neighbour” act, but some unscrupulous people could well argue the same thing and then it’s the shop who will have to make a decision. A representative of one supermarket said they will be using their discretion in cases like that. So far my husband and I have been lucky as far as the virus is concerned.  We are both in the “vulnerable” age group, both being in our 70s, and I have asthma too, which puts me in the “At Risk” group, but to date we are both well.  It is just such a weird feeling that the whole world is in lockdown, forbidden to socialise (which is hard when we are sociable people) and told to self-isolate at home.  Everything we usually go to or had booked to go to later in the year has been cancelled, most notably the holiday we had booked for next week to celebrate our Golden Wedding Anniversary (which was back in December.)  We’d booked a large house to which we MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer and all our four children and their partners and our five grandchildren were planning to go for a grand get-together, given that we are widely spread around the country between Glasgow, Bath and London, and we were due to go next week.  Now, of course, it’s off.  Although none of us actually has the virus, our oldest granddaughter’s university closed early because one of the students had tested positive for coronavirus, and our granddaughter was then terrified of passing it on to us.  Since then, of course, there’s been a total ban on all travelling and socialising, and all schools and universities are closed, whether or not anyone has, or has been in contact with, the virus.  Either way it looked for a while as though we were going to lose the over £2000 we’d paid for the holiday, but when I emailed the firm letting the house and explained everything, they offered to amend our booking to next year instead.  We were very happy with this outcome and have accepted, so at least we haven’t lost our money and still have the get-together to look forward to, even if it will be a little late!  We can only hope we’ll all still be fit and well by this time next year! It’s hard to know at this stage what we think about the government’s response to the virus – who knows which country has the right idea?  In some ways I think it would have been better to give us some idea of how long this lockdown is likely to go on for (even though nobody knows) since the most depressing part of the whole thing is that we keep being told that it might go on for months, even years…  In which case there will be an awful lot of depression and mental problems for the hard-pressed NHS to deal with, as well as the virus itself.  Today’s thinking from No 10 (though it changes daily!) is that we might get it cracked within 12 weeks.  If that’s the case that’s great, that’s something to hold on to.  We can cope for 12 weeks.  It’s just the thought of a never-ending ban on seeing our friends and families, on being able to buy enough food to eat, on normal life shutting down with no end in sight, that is going to make everyone feel worse. Of course, if at the end of the 12 weeks we were told they hadn’t cracked it and it would take another 12 weeks, that would be difficult, but I still think it’s better to have some sort of a deadline to hold on to, rather than the fear that things will never improve… Saturday 20th March Today is a beautiful sunny day, so we feel very inclined to go out for a walk this afternoon, if we can think of somewhere that is unlikely to be crowded.  Of course, we’re told not to make unnecessary journeys, but also that we must continue to take exercise, go out in the fresh air etc., so we all have to make a decision for ourselves and our own situation.  There are two walks we often do which are usually free of other people and not far from home, but both require the car to get there, so I think we will try one of those.  I read today that one of the good things about the coronavirus is that pollution levels around the world have dropped significantly, thanks to more people working from home, less traffic, fewer aeroplanes etc. etc.  It’s nice that there are some things to be glad about! MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer However, one other thing I heard today (on a webinar from a writers’ group to which I belong) is that some people seem to delight in quoting all the doom-laden headlines that keep flooding the news – and in these days when everyone is staying at home, it’s hard to keep away from them (apparently they are called “doom-surfers”!)  It was suggested that you could either ask them politely to desist, OR, if they won’t, threaten to go into another room when they start, OR (my favourite option!) start singing “The sun will come out tomorrow…” every time they quote another gloomy headline! We all need something to cheer us up at this time. I am also feeling somewhat peeved that tomorrow is not only Mothering Sunday, when we should have a chance to see some of our nearest and dearest, it is also my birthday! A few parcels have been delivered (via Amazon, for which many thanks!) and a handful of cards arrived earlier in the week, but apparently our post is likely to be delivered in batches every three days or so, according to our postman when my husband spoke to him yesterday. So I may not get any more cards, for either occasion, for some time! One rather unmentionable topic which seems to be connected with the current situation is that for the past week I have been very constipated, and I’m connecting this with the stress we’re all under at the moment.  The reason I’ve suddenly realised this is that the last time I had this problem was ten years ago when my husband was in hospital having an operation for prostate cancer, and the stress obviously got to me then, because as soon as he came home, cured, my problem was instantly resolved!  Unfortunately I may have to wait a little longer for this problem to be resolved, but it’s the only reason I can think of.  Normally I’m a very optimistic person and I don’t look on the black side, but obviously the stress comes out somewhere along the line! However, on the plus side, it sounds as though tomorrow is also going to be a beautiful sunny day (a big plus – rain just makes us feel even more miserable!), and we’ve just discovered that our Sunday paper (The Observer) will be delivered as usual, so that is something to be very thankful for!  We only take one newspaper a week, and that’s it, and we really enjoy reading it from cover to cover every Sunday, so at least it appears that that will happen!  We’re beginning to get to the stage of thinking nothing normal is likely to happen ever again, so it’s good to find out that we’re wrong on some counts, at any rate. Tuesday 24 March Well, it was a rather strange birthday on Sunday, but it still felt special.  Many cards and parcels had arrived by Saturday, so I had plenty to open on my birthday, and two more cards came yesterday.  And I had lots of messages via facebook and email, so altogether it could have been a great deal worse.  And, as promised, the weather was beautiful!  We didn’t go out, partly because I was expecting phone calls from my children (all of which happened, including a video call via facebook messenger with our eldest daughter and our oldest grandchildren, which was lovely!) and partly because the advice to stay at home was becoming increasingly strong. MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer Yesterday, however, my husband was very keen to get out to have “a last walk before we have to stay in for months!”, so after lunch we drove the 9 miles up to our favourite country walk, usually deserted, but inevitably yesterday we saw more people there than we ever had before!  Luckily everyone was sensible, and we all kept the obligatory 2 metres apart, but that really decided us that it was the last time we’d be doing it until after this is all over. It did feel good, though, especially since the weather was beautiful again, but unfortunately since then my husband has had a lot of trouble walking – his hip is causing him great pain.  I suspect it could be connected with the shoulder that has been giving him trouble for weeks and which has contributed to him feeling, as he says, “like an old man!”  Possibly the fact that he’s had to hold himself differently because of it has led to walking differently too. Anyway, we won’t be doing much more walking now, except for a possible occasional walk round the block, which is not very exciting! Other than that my main problem is that of food!  I tried to sign up for Sainsburys delivery, only to find that they are refusing to take on new customers at the moment (I thought I’d signed up years ago, but they don’t appear to want to know that!)  So this morning I tried to sign up for Tesco’s delivery, only to find that they are also refusing to take on new customers.  I’m not quite sure what to do next – although I have plenty of food in at the moment, I can see that by the end of the week I shall need more eggs, bread etc., not to mention fresh veg.  I could if necessary ask my neighbours to get them in for me, but it would be so much better to order everything I want myself online and either have it delivered or collect it myself from our local branch.  Ah well, I’ll just have to keep trying every day and see if they change their minds! However, with regard to the unmentionable topic I mentioned on Saturday, we found three pills to alleviate constipation that were still in date, so I took one on Sunday evening, and then yesterday I went to the local chemist and managed to get a bottle of something I’d had before that worked, so that when the pills ran out I’d have something that was in date (my previous bottle had to be used by 2017!).  But before I’d taken any of it, the single pill I’d taken must have worked, because the problem was solved!  Phew!  But at least I now have some backup in case it happens again. Wednesday 25 March Today I began by trying to ring two friends to see how they were getting on, but both were out (taking their dogs for walks) so I left messages for each of them and got on with other things.  Subsequently they both rang back, so I had a nice chat with them both. One of them told me, unbelievably, that someone in her road had sent round an invitation to everyone in the street to go and join them for a garden drinks party!!!  This, when we have all been warned to stay indoors and self-isolate, ie NOT meet other people!  Some people don’t seem to have any sense at all.  My friend said it looked as though everyone was refusing to go, thank goodness! Then, after a visit (2 metres away) from our next-door neighbour bringing me some eggs in case I was running out and volunteering to add my shopping to their online shopping list later this week.  I then decided to write a list online that I could just MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer email to them whenever they’re ready to order – only it turned out to be two lists: a short one and a long one, depending on when it’s likely to be.  I tried again to get online with both Sainsbury’s and Tesco’s, but they’re still not taking on any more customers.  Later we had a very nice chat with our neighbours from our own gardens, so several feet apart, which was really nice.  The sun was shining and it was very pleasant out there – and we all agreed it’s so important to keep up some social contact at this time! This morning my husband rang our surgery to ask if it was possible to speak to our doctor about his hip, which is causing him a lot of pain so he can still hardly walk, and they told him to ring back at 2 o’clock.  He did that and was told our doctor would ring him back within the hour.  The doctor duly called and they had a really helpful discussion about what might be causing it, and the upshot was the doctor prescribed some painkillers for him, but told him if it wasn’t better by the beginning of next week it may be useful to get it X-rayed.  Anyway, I went to pick up his prescription from the pharmacy and found a table in the entrance stopping people from going inside.  That meant there was a long queue of people waiting outside, all 2 metres apart so it stretched right across the car park! I joined the queue, and had to wait quite a while, with others joining all the time, so I was very glad it was a lovely day – it wouldn’t have been much fun if it had been raining!  Some time later I reached the table, to be told that they were just making up his prescription so would I wait at the side…  Eventually I was able to collect it and take it home for him, and he’s now started on the new treatment.  We both hope it will work! Friday 27th March Today is the day we should have been driving to Hereford to start our Golden Wedding Celebratory week with all the children.  Instead, although the weather is still gorgeous, (as gorgeous as we would like for a holiday!) we are at home, self-isolating, as are all our children in their own homes.  However, bitter cold weather and even snow are forecast for the weekend, so maybe it’s just as well we’re not going this year – and maybe next year the week we’ve just had, weatherwise, will be the same, except that we’ll be allowed to get together and celebrate!  Something to hang on to, I think! Meanwhile my husband’s hip seems to be improving with the aid of the painkillers, so long may that continue.  And our lovely next-door neighbours said they are planning to go to the supermarket today and would get some shopping for me, so I’ve given them a shopping list and will wait to see what they can get.  (It was hard to know whether to give them a list of things I’d need over the next week or so, to avoid having to ask them too often, or to give them an extremely short list of very basic essentials.  In the end I gave them a list of  about 20 items, with the proviso that it didn’t matter if they couldn’t get them all.  I hope they didn’t stare at my list in horror, thinking all I was going to want was bread, eggs and milk!) I suspect that the general thinking is that little old ladies only want basics, whereas this little not-quite­so-old lady actually still likes cooking and following recipes! MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer Interestingly, last night I rang our younger son, recently divorced and living alone, and he sounded quite chirpy. He said he’s really enjoying cooking and trying out new food, and he’d just bought an aubergine and was wondering what to do with it!  I think I’ll send him a couple of recipes this morning. Actually yesterday afternoon I tried Sainsbury’s Online again, but still couldn’t get into the site; however, when I tried Tesco’s online I managed to get into the site and actually make a long shopping list – but when it came to paying, they wouldn’t let me book a slot for delivery, so they wouldn’t let me pay either.  All delivery slots, it appeared, were full till the end of April, and the only way of getting round that was by doing Click and Collect – but the nearest branch of Tesco’s to collect from is ten miles away, so that’s no good.  So having spent all afternoon negotiating their rather complicated online system, it still didn’t help.  So I was extremely grateful for our neighbours’ offer. However, I did note from Tesco’s online ordering that lots of items were completely out of stock, such as eggs!!!  It will be interesting to see what our neighbours manage to find in the shop… Saturday 27th March Very well, as it turns out!  They managed to get almost everything on my list, which was great (including a dozen eggs, which were unobtainable from Tesco’s!)  They also said they’d be going again probably at the end of next week, so I’ve got a week to compile another list.  I was able to pay them via BACS online, since people are getting twitchy about handling actual cash at the moment, so that was a great help. Other than that my husband’s hip is still giving him a lot of trouble except when the painkillers kick in, so we’re a little concerned about what will happen when the painkillers run out by the end of next week.  The doctor did say if they didn’t work it may mean getting an x-ray, but we’re not keen on a) driving to the hospital (and finding somewhere to park) or b) spending any time there, given that that’s where all the serious coronavirus cases are.  It also seems wrong to take up the medical staff who would otherwise be working with the really sick.  On the other hand, my poor husband can still hardly walk, which is not ideal, even if we are confined to barracks. So we’re just going to wait and see if it improves on its own. I forgot to mention one lovely thing on Thursday night: on television we’d all been urged to stand at our doors/windows at 8.00 pm and clap to support the NHS staff and carers who are doing such a brilliant job at this time.  So at 8.00, even though we weren’t sure if anyone else in our little close would be doing it, we stood outside our front door and started clapping.  Simultaneously our next-door neighbours the other side of us came out and started clapping, and then we could hear a huge swell of clapping and cheering all across the city! Someone even let off some fireworks, presumably for the same purpose.  It was really quite moving, and later they showed videos of it happening all over the country, and all the medical staff were really touched.  I don’t know what we’d all do without them! MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer Interestingly, yesterday our (not so dearly beloved) Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, tested positive for the virus, along with the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Witty.  Of course this has caused some consternation, not least because only two days ago BJ and MH were photographed sitting next to each other on the front benches in Parliament – blatantly ignoring their own “2 metres apart” rule!  (And next to Matt Hancock sat Michael Gove, and next to him Jacob Rees-Mogg – so you can’t help wondering if they are at all worried that they could be next!) Not that one actually wishes any of them harm, but they have been slightly hoist with their own petard!  On the other hand, if the idiots who have been partying blithely in spite of the restrictions begin to realise that nobody is immune from this virus, maybe it will do some good after all. Monday 30 March Further news on my husband’s health: yesterday he woke up and said his hip felt a whole lot better (!) and he was actually able to walk properly for the first time for days.  This is wonderful!  Unfortunately his shoulder and neck are now hurting again, so he’s carrying on with the painkillers until they run out, and then it will be back on the paracetomol.  I thought of the wheat bag treatment for his neck, so heated it and he tried it this morning and said it felt great, so hopefully that will make him relax a little.  I’m beginning to wonder if this is tension due to anxiety about the current pandemic.  Like me he is pretty cheerful and upbeat, but who knows what is going on inside our brains?  With me it’s obviously constipation, with him maybe a shoulder problem – a friend has just suggested it could be Frozen shoulder, so he’s busy looking it up online at the moment to see if anyone has any suggestions that we can try at home, given that doctors and hospitals have other things on their minds at the moment! How pathetic it seems, in the face of this pandemic, to worry about such minor problems – but at the moment they do feel major! Wednesday 1 April Today his shoulder is feeling marginally better, mainly thanks to a good night’s sleep!  And he is doing as much as possible, so has put off ringing the doctor until tomorrow (or so).  This can only be a good thing!  And he can walk quite normally now, thank goodness! Another good thing: our Dancing teacher has posted a video on WhatsApp to show us how to do one of our dances that was giving us all a problem – this is brilliant! We have been able to do it over and over again, as many times as we like, so it’s finally beginning to go in!  My husband has also been able to write it down, as he’s always said he wanted to do.  This is such a great idea, being able to keep dancing in our isolation! MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer I’ve also managed to phone our pharmacy to ask them to deliver our medication, and they are very happy to do that!  Hooray!  Given that we are both in the vulnerable age group it’s great to know we won’t have to go along and queue in the cold for ages every time we need to collect our prescriptions! Sadly there’s still no chance to get onto the Sainsbury’s website to make a list, either for delivery or for collection, so I shall just continue to make a list for our lovely neighbours to get for us next time they go to Waitrose. People keep sending us delightful videos etc. to keep us entertained during the lockdown – one came from one of our dancing group on WhatsApp, and it’s hilarious!  A dancing group from Russia, all in black and white outfits.  I’d love to send it on to others, but don’t know how to do it!  My husband and I do far more online stuff than many of our contemporaries, but I still keep finding things I don’t know how to do – must ask my children! I had a nice surprise this morning – one of the online publishers from whom I have bought several books in the past announced that for today only it is giving away 46 books for free!  I clicked on and found I’d already downloaded several of them, but there were several others I hadn’t downloaded, so I quickly downloaded them onto my Kindle.  I’m unlikely to run out of books to read, that’s for sure! Now the internet is going a bit wobbly, so I think I’ll knock off for the time being and hope it comes back stronger later on! Friday 3 April The internet is back strongly again, which is good news.  We do rely on it at the moment especially! Monday 6 April We’ve only done two weeks of lockdown, but already it feels like an eternity! However, we are still okay, and provided we stay indoors and don’t go out and/or talk to people I can’t see how we are likely to catch coronavirus.  Now the Prime Minister has it and last night was taken into hospital because it wouldn’t go away, so maybe people will now take notice of the advice to stay indoors and self-isolate!  It’s not a whole lot of fun, especially in such lovely weather, but it does seem to make a whole lot of sense.  It appears that the Health Minister, who caught it at the same time as the PM, has now recovered, so he’s struggling on.  Our (not so) dearly beloved PM insists that he is still running the country from his hospital bed, but that rather remains to be seen.  And as for the others who sat close together on the front bench of the Commons, in spite of the instructions to remain 2 metres apart, we’ve heard nothing about their health – yet.  One doesn’t wish them to suffer, exactly, but you can’t help feeling it’s about time they realised that they are in the same boat as the rest of the country, and that this wretched virus can attack anyone, no matter how much money they have or which school they went to! MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer Enough.  I’ve already made it clear in a previous missive what my feelings are about the Tory party and the PM in particular, so I won’t go on about it, or him.  But I am very pleased that at last we have a new Leader of the Opposition in Keir Starmer, who seems so sensible and leader-like compared with his opposite number.  I wish him well – he can only be a huge improvement on his predecessor, and hopefully will do what he says and hold the government to account, most notably with regard to their handling of the coronavirus crisis.  He also said, however, that he does not intend to do “political point-scoring” on principle, which his predecessor did, but will do his best to help bring the country together to defeat the virus.  Hooray!  Common sense at last! I’ve still had no luck getting onto a supermarket website to do my own shopping, but our lovely next-door neighbours have said they will do another online shop on Thursday, so we can add our order to theirs, and I’ve said I’ll give them my list on Wednesday. I can keep adding to it up till then, which is useful.  I seem to spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about food these days, though: such as “What shall we have?  What do I need to make it?  How fussy should I be when asking someone else to do my shopping for me?”  And of course, “What do I have in the fridge/freezer/cupboard that needs using up first?” Not to mention “Will there be any in the supermarket?”  (Already there are shortages of all sorts of things – notably toilet rolls, bread, flour, eggs, etc. etc.!)  And most notably for me “Will it fit with my eating plan?”  This latter because for the first time I’ve found an eating plan that a) allows me to lose weight! b) I like and c) doesn’t leave me feeling hungry!  But because of the unprecedented circumstances it’s that much more difficult to get all the ingredients I want in order to continue to lose the weight I need to lose!  (Just over 1 ½ stone so far, and still going…) I’m doing my best, but it does put an additional pressure onto what is already a complicated situation. The other thing I’ve found takes up a lot of time, though I don’t begrudge this, is keeping in touch with my family (of course) and many friends, some of whom I’m not in frequent contact with but at this time feel I want to check how they are.  Some I can email, some need phone calls, but all more frequently than usual, and they all take up TIME!  Not that I begrudge it, but it does mean that what initially felt like acres of spare time, suddenly isn’t quite such a lot after all.  I’d thought I could easily finish the book I’m currently writing within a few weeks, but somehow it’s not happening anything like as quickly as I’d like.  And many of my other writer friends are saying the same thing: they’re not getting as much done as they thought they would.  I think it’s because we all have so many other things going on in our minds that they all seem more important than the stories we’re making up! Tuesday 7 April Well, how quickly things change!  Last night our PM was moved into Intensive Care, which nobody was expecting (least of all him, by the sound of things!  He kept insisting he was well enough to run the government, even though he clearly wasn’t!) So the Foreign Secretary appears to have stepped in as his Deputy in all but name.  MO B6619 F 74 married Bath Children’s Writer Why isn’t there a Deputy Prime Minister?  Surely there should be someone – the new Labour man has a deputy, and as far as I can recall most previous Tory PMs had a deputy (David Cameron had Nick Clegg during the coalition, didn’t he?) If anything, this underlines the fact that we certainly don’t want a republic.  At least with the royal family there is a genuine line of succession which nobody can argue with (though some have tried!).  Everyone knows who will step up when the current monarch is no longer able to continue, whether temporarily or permanently.  It’s not going to involve a complicated process of loud voices suddenly jumping into the ring clamouring “ME ME ME!”  That’s how we got the current PM, after all, and presumably why he insisted he didn’t need a deputy.  And that’s how the USA became lumbered with their current President.  (Note: Trump insists he hasn’t got the coronavirus, but I wonder who would be brave enough to tell him if he had?  And if he had, would he admit it to the world?  I’m sure in his eyes being infected equals weakness, therefore he can’t possibly have it!) Wednesday 8 April Ten things I will really appreciate when this is all over… 1) Being able to see all our family and friends in person! 2) Being able to go out and about again, driving or walking or just sitting in the countryside, on the beaches or in the parks, and visiting friends. 3) Being able to do my own shopping! 4) Being able to get my hair cut! 5) Being able to go to theatres, concerts and the cinema again. 6) Being able to go out for meals from time to time. 7) Our Dancing lessons starting again. 8) Being able to go to monthly Dances and Dinner Dances again and wear the new posh frock I bought just before the lockdown! 9) Being able to book a holiday in the confident expectation that it will happen. 10)The television news being rather more cheerful, instead of full of the latest figures of coronavirus victims and deaths!  (I know the newsroom is valiantly trying to persuade everyone to follow the government’s guidelines, but please don’t make us all even more miserable than we are already!) Things I have actually appreciated during the lockdown: 1) Keeping in touch with our family via phone, email and video messaging. 2) Keeping in touch with friends via phone, email and video messaging – a perfect excuse to get in touch with an old friend we’ve maybe neglect"

A healthy body means endeavouring, at my age, to keep fit with a healthy varied diet, with three meals a day, exercise like daily walks, weekly visits to the gym and swimming pool (this year of course these activities have not been open much of the time).My first experiences of health and wellbeing would have been over 70 years ago through my Mother cooking nourishing meals- not always easy just after WW2 with food shortages and rationing. Exercise was important then but as we didn't have a car in the family 70 years ago we all walked more, to school, shopping, We did cycle a lot but that is a good form of exercise; these last few years have seen cycling very popular again with many cycle lanes in our towns, and all roads where possible. We are often told today that our health problems, obesity , is due to lack of exercise and not eating the 'right' food, although I do realise finance comes into what food can be bought in some families, the most nutricous food may be more expensive, also could take longer to prepare and cook and in todays rather hectic lifestyle time can be important.I didn't really think much about health and wellbeing as a child, just accepting the food my Mother cooked, some of which would be called stodgy now! And plenty of walking/cycling exercise as mentioned. I am relatively fortunate as I do not 'put on' too much weight whatever I eat. I don't recall any advice about health at school - but that was in the late 1940's/1950's. We were too busy recovering from the war. We wouldn't have put weight on with sweets as they were still rationed.Key momentsMy Mother told me about having periods. I think she found it an embarrassing subject nearly 70 years ago. She gave me a book to read about adolescent subjects, and when my periods began at age 12 she just handed me products to use. I don't recall discussing bodily changes with my friends, but as mentioned things were not as 'openly discussed' as now. I just coped and accepted all the changes. I do remember having my first bra, but my Mother bought it.Of course as a teenager I did begin to think more about my appearance, what clothes I wore, make­ up, Most of my clothes as a small child were made by my Mother and Aunts, with occasional special outfits made by a dressmaker. I can still remember standing on a chair as our dressmaker - luckily a family friend who didn't charge too much, pinned dresses and skirts, and she also made my first petticoats. Everyone knitted, and I had many aunts who were not married and they knitted for my sister and myself. When I began work at age 15 and had a small wage I began to buy ready made clothes- one beautiful skirt by well known Gor-ray cost under £2. I have a photo of myself wearing it. I also went to the hairdresser more often once I began earning, a lovely experience then in your own individual cubicle. I also purchased face powder, lipstick, rouge and some eye shadow mostly from Boots where I stiJ) shop today..-2-Mass Observation -Autumn Directive (Cont'd) Part 2 : Everyday Health and WellbeingI don't think my parents, back in the 1940's/l 950's were too concerned with Fashion. My Father as a company secretary - white collar worker, had to wear a smart suit during the week and even at the weekends wouldn't have been seen with out a tie. I have old black and white photographs of my sister and I members of my family sitting on the beach in Cliftonville, my Grandmother has a smart hat and dress on, my Grandfather a suit and hat my Father does look to have an open top shirt and shorts, my sister and I have pretty dresses on, but we all look very happy! I do think back then we did all dress 'individuality' as many outfits were hand made, half the population looks the same thesedays. My parents did go to dinner/dances organised by my Father's company and again I have black & white photographs - my Father in a evening suit and my Mother in lovely, sometimes long, ballroom dresses. Even when I started work, at age 15, in an office, I was not allowed to wear trousers, but a smart blouse, jersey and skirt, no jeans and sloppy jumper. I still like to change when going out in the afternoon/evening - now retired I may have been doing housework, preparing a meal in the morning with an apron on.I do try and keep up-to-date with ways to keep a healthy lifestyle, medical advances, smart if not in high fashion, but mainly, in my late 70's, I hope my health will remain stable for a while yet. At the moment I'm waiting for the vaccine and sincerely hope next year life will begin to return to some sort of normality.."

We both had Comirnaty (Pfizer) which was a first for me as I had previously had the Astra Zeneca.  My Partner had been given the Pfizer vaccine both times previously.  I have to say that we were both feeling really rough for a good 72 hours afterwards & our arm and shoulders were really painful too.  It is just as well that I booked the appointment for when I was on holiday, as we had absolute thumping headaches. For us, changes in restrictions have made little difference as we have both felt that things are still too risky to be going out and about too much and certainly not to large events or crowded places. We had been looking forward to going to see ELO Again at the Exmouth Pavilions in November, booked before the first lock down and cancelled once already, but were not prepared to risk the crowd. However, hopefully we will be front row next time they come.  We have continued to wear masks in public places and on transport. In late September we met up with my Brother R and Sister in Law K at Hestercombe Gardens near Taunton, one of our favourite places to go.  I did not know that my Cousin’s C and P were coming as well with C’s Wife S and my Aunty M who I have not seen since November 2019.  She has been isolated throughout and the effect on her mental health has been marked and sadly very noticeable when talking on the phone, our only possible contact.  She had no idea that we were going to be there and she got out the car and as we had our first hug she just stood there and sobbed.  This whole lock down had been so damaging to those who have been largely stuck at home.  Her sobbing brought home just how painful and distressing this has been for so many.  However, we all had a lovely day and the weather was very kind to us, Aunt M did really well with her walking and the rest of us walked down to see where our Gran and Granddad W used to live in one of the lodges.  We had ice cream and later a nice cup of tea before saying our goodbyes.  It was a glorious place to meet up for the first time and brought back some wonderful memories too. Two weeks later we went by train to Barnstaple to spend the day with Aunt M as it was her birthday. We had a good journey up, wearing our masks at all times until we got to the flat.  I was surprised by how many people did not wear masks, especially the young people, even though it was a requirement of the train companies.  We had a perfect few hours with Aunt M and took lunch with us as our favourite restaurant in Barnstaple has sadly closed down.  Aunt M was so much brighter and clearly benefiting from having more company. These were our only outings this autumn, other than that we had small meals at home with 3 or 4 people, all tested and safe for each other. It has not been a case of returning to work for me as we have continued to go into work since the first lock down began. However we moved to a different office building in July 2021 so now currently have to share with other departments on the same floor in an open plan air conditioned office. It has certainly been noticeable when the other staff began to return to work; sometimes it has felt too busy and noisy, especially in the communal areas, although everyone has still worn masks in those spaces. We have tested with Lateral Flow regularly to make sure we keep our colleagues safe. There has also been an NHS test site in our back car park since November. Normality has not really been on the cards for any of us as our work patterns have continued, in fact due to being short staffed I have worked average 40 hour weeks or more since March 2021, I am usually only on a 26.5 hour contract p/w.  The one brilliant thing for me in the autumn was that we had enough staff so a) I could finally take leave (lots of it) and b) my hours returned to 26.5 4 days on 4 days off, which has been great for my health, and it’s been fantastic to have time with Di my Partner and to have a life!! I finally feel rested for the first time in over 2 ½ years. Energy Bills The rise in energy bills is a huge worry for everyone and I know through my job that many of the people we support are already making a decision between food and heat; they simply do not know how they are going to pay the bills. Some of my colleagues have been told that their gas and electric will go from £90 per month to nearly £200 per month and that is before the massive hike in April.  It is scary for so many people and with the constant price rises at the pumps getting to work is becoming more and more expensive as well.  I live in an area where good and reliable public transport is not available and so people have to use their cars to get to work, or if they’re carers to even do their jobs. The cost of pretty much everything is rapidly rising so we are all facing a difficult time ahead and so are some already beleaguered small traders. We have a Rayburn so are using that as much as possible and cutting down on the small amount of gas that we do use. Smokeless fuel has not gone up that much and certainly less than our utility bills. It is utterly unforgiveable that people must make a choice between eating and heating in this day and age. With all the utility companies that have gone bust customers have been swapped to other larger companies often at much higher cost to them.  We have stuck with the same company for over 15 years and I am glad that we have as we would have faced the same disruption and worry now. With increasing uncertainty around Russia’s intention in the Crimean Peninsula we could be looking at even bigger price hikes in the coming year. With all of this and the 1 ½ % rises in NI starting in April 2022 my wages in real terms will be considerably less that they were pre COVID.  However, there is nothing that I can do about it, we will just have to cut our cloth accordingly and be very careful.  I am just thankful that we should be able to get through the next 2 years without too much hardship; we have never lived a high life, and have not had lots of holidays or a busy social life so hopefully we won’t feel the pinch too badly. Poppy centenary 2021 I must admit that I did not see too much of the celebrations for the centenary.  We always wear our poppies without fail, and feel that this is very important show of support for our armed forces and a small but important mark of respect to all those who have fallen and died in conflicts.  We do always watch the remembrance service at the Royal Albert Hall; it never fails to make me weep when the poppies silently fall to the floor, and while it was a shame that the event had to be scaled down it was still beautiful and powerful. Murder of Davis Amess MP The tragic murder of David Amess was such a terrible thing to happen. He was genuinely well loved and respected by the constituents he served and was a decent hard working Member of Parliament.  Like Jo Cox he left a huge void in his constituency, because they were both exceptionally good MP’s who gave exemplary service to those who elected them.  It brings home just how vulnerable MP’s can be when out meeting their local constituents at their surgeries.  Sadly MP’s like all those in the public eye are so very vulnerable to the attention of people with axes to grind or who sadly suffer with mental health problems as well as people who have been radicalised.  His death was a sober reminder that we live in an age when people needing serious help are slipping through the net and young men and women who are being radicalised are slipping beneath the radar of police and security services.  When that results in injury or the deaths of innocent people, whoever they are it is a tragic waste of life. Owen Paterson MP I have to say that I am wholeheartedly sick to the back teeth of the ongoing sleaze coming out of the current government. It seems that with each passing month we see more exposés on dodgy contracts given to friends or party donors that have cost the tax payer billions of pounds.  What is harder to swallow is that those contracts failed to produce anything useable, so ministers fall on their swords as video’s, photographs and emails are leaked to the press.  It seems that there must be some within the Civil Service who are as fed up with the status quo as we all are. So I cannot say that I was surprised when yet another scandal hit yet another former Tory minister. Own Paterson was found to have lobbied for companies who paid him at least £500,000.  He made no less than 14 approaches to Ministers and Civil Servants on behalf of his paying clients.  He was found to have breached rules preventing MP’s from taking paid advocacy.  He brought Parliament into disrepute and joined a list of MP’s and Ministers who were embroiled in scandal and potentially corruption, but then this is a party that is so disdainful of the rules and moral codes that they are supposed to uphold.  So this really came as no surprise and that is a very sad reflection on a government that feels it is above the law that it sets for others. What I was not expecting even from the Conservatives was that Andrea Leadson would put forward a motion to delay Paterson’s suspension and set up a committee to investigate the disciplinary process for MP’s.  She wished to disrupt the very process that investigates MP’s when they are found to have done wrong, which was utterly mind blowing. Boris’ Government actually supported this motion and with the strong influence of the Whip’s it passed 250-232, and Paterson was actually one of the MP’s who voted for it. I found myself asking if we had suddenly come under some tin pot dictatorship, it was so appalling and even I did not think that they could sink this low.  But thanks to a massive public and press backlash and a revolt by backbench MP’s it all did a U turn and Paterson resigned before he was pushed (they must be running out of swords in Whitehall).  All I can say is that we live in dangerous times when our elected government can literally change the rules to protect their own corrupt backsides. I pray that we see the back of this collection of charlatans very soon. HRH Prince Andrew We really don’t know the truth of what happened in this case yet, and I am not sure that we ever will. I do feel that Andrew is implicated in these proceedings and that there is no smoke without fire. The fact that he continued to have a friendship with Epstein even after he had been convicted of sex offences was at best a serious lapse of judgement or at worst a sign of his own complicity. The interview he insisted on giving on BBC News night was an arrogant unbelievable train wreck. We will have to see how this plays out legally in the coming months, if it ever does.  In the mean time I feel the honourable thing would be for him to step back from all public and royal duties. I feel truly sorry for Her Majesty the Queen who must be reeling from the loss of her beloved Husband only to have to deal with the awful mess her Son has got himself into.  It makes me sad that she has to deal with it at this time in her life. I also feel so sorry for all the victims of this high society paedophile ring, because they get lost in all the hype of these public scandals, people are so fascinated by the rich & famous falling from grace they forget the people who’s suffering caused that fall, we may never even know who all of them were.  Like so much going on at the moment it is a sad reflection of our times that scandal, corruption and a total loss of moral decency and values are so rife in public life."

So, I work at a further education college and right at the beginning of 2021 the country went back in to lockdown but it was different for me as I was still going in to work because there were vulnerable students that needed to keep coming back into college instead of staying at home (where they were more vulnerable) – This meant that I was going to have to be tested on an almost daily basis coming to work. The whole of the sports hall, over the Christmas period, had been turned into a testing centre. It was also being used for the whole community. Before I went in there was a little video of how the process was going to work and what you had to do. So, I turned up by the sports hall and we were let in one by one. There was a frightened look in most people’s faces. Some of the staff had taken on the training to actually do the testing. Obviously there was no heating and it was freezing. in fact I think of the first day it was snowing outside and we all just had to wait out in the snow. We were going to die of exposure instead of COVID. Anyway you had to sit down in the first booth, take of your gloves and squirt loads of alcohol gel (I said this was pointless as I had gloves on but I was told I had to do it.) Then I had to give details like date of birth, had I had any symptoms. I was then asked for my mobile phone number and this caused a bit of a stir because I said I did not have a phone. They then had to set up a system whereby they could register my information on my behalf and then I would be sent an e-mail. I then had to go to the next booth (the chair was all sprayed down for me. One member of staff was on the other side of a big Perspex screen and they were also wearing a big clear face shield, a mouth mask and a plastic apron. I could barely hear what she was saying. Through the little gap underneath the Perspex screen she handed me the little, just opened, brush that I had to run along my tonsils and then up my nose. You had a mirror in front of you to help to do it but it was cold, I had a mask on, I had to lean forward to the mirror, my glasses were all steamed up and she was watching how I was doing it. really I just wanted to stick it up my nose as putting it anywhere near my tonsils was making me gag. Anyway, do that, count to turn and then hand the brush to the girl behind the screen, she then put it into the little pot and then I had to walk down the length of the sports hall, out of the other side and then I had to be held in a waiting area....outside....for half an hour. Then, if you were lucky, somebody would remember that you were waiting for a result and after half an hour someone would come out and tell you that your result was negative. When you were waiting they had painted little feet on the places you had to stand. You couldn’t sit down at all save you might contaminate the area. Frightening. I had to do this twice a week and it was an utter pain. 8 weeks later they started to give us tests that we could do on our own but those first weeks, especially with the very bad weather, were horrible. I never got to see the test and was only told it was negative (I have MOA P5366 Male, 47, Married, Portsmouth, Teacher had no positive tests). Since the first week of January until the 19th of July I have been doing a lateral flow test twice a week. Once on Monday morning and then on Thursday morning. I go through the rigamarole of doing the test (I do it just after coming out of the shower, in the bedroom). Wait for half an hour and then log onto the NHS website, log in and then scan in the test before going through all the questions and then registering my negative test. I then have to do the same thing for my two older children who do it on the same days as I do. It takes a lot longer to log in their results as I have to do that as a ‘guest’ so you have to find their school and postcode and then log them against a mobile phone number. It is a bit of a pain when you are rushing to get to school! How many tests is that, 50 ish? Maybe. By taking the tests at least I was able to show my work place that I was negative, so I could work. Also it showed the students that I was working with that I was negative so it gave a level of confidence. What was annoying that it only too a few students and a few members of staff to not do a few tests and then there was an outbreak and a number of classes had to be sent home. Some people were really ill with it. So it only takes one person not doing the tests properly to then lose confidence in the whole system. We have quite a few boxes of the lateral flow tests in the house. At the beginning they were like gold dust and people were asking me if they could borrow just one test. I think it was the liquid for the test that was hard to come by. Now there are tests by the pallet load in the college, a lot destined not to be used I suppose. I weep at the amount of plastic in each of the boxes. I have a very low opinion of the Test and Trace programme in England. I believe that it cost about 37 billion pounds. Billion. I have also seen that this amount of money would easily have been enough to double vaccinate every single person in the world. It only works if the tests are reliable which they are not. It also only works if people are willing to follow the advice of the app, which they are less likely to do if they are going to lose their job. As I write this there is a ‘pingdemic’ where there are millions of people getting pinged every day and therefore having to isolate. this is bringing the country to a standstill and obviously it will be affecting the poorer more than the rich. Twas ever thus. The government just threw money at the project, hoping it would work and it hasn’t. They are also liable for the huge amount of money that has been wasted or even fraudulently taken by companies saying that they could help. Just awful. Also the accuracy of the tests are about 70% accurate, I think and that all depends on if they are done properly. I also think if you get a negative result the accuracy is lower. They are not reliable but they are all we have at the moment. Everything is in such a mess. MOA P5366 Male, 47, Married, Portsmouth, Teacher I have only been testing because I have had to do so for work. I do not think they are accurate and so I am still wearing my mask and will be likely to when I go back to work in early September (when I am sure there will be another outbreak) – There are so many people in Portsmouth that have completely forgotten about the guidelines and on ‘Freedom Day’ they all took off their masks and forgot about everything. I am still quite happy to be tested, for what it is worth but I feel it is a false sense of security."
