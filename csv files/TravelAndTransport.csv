I had my first jab in December and my second in February.  The first one I thought was a placebo but the second I did feel was the actual vaccine.  I was offered the usual Covid vaccine in February (as I am 70) so they had to unblind me on the trial and it proved that indeed, I had been fully vaccinated.  So, I and other volunteers, were lucky in that we were vaccinated ahead of most other people.  This did make me feel safer. However, this was a very long procedure.  We had to have blood and other tests.  We were there four hours for the first jab and three hours for the second.  So, a lot more waiting around that those that have either Oxford, Pfizer or Moderna. I travelled there by car.  The atmosphere was pleasant although a little messy with regards to the organisation. The side effects from the second jab were fatigue, a headache and arm ache. Only lasted a day. I am still following all the government guidelines, wearing a mask, social distancing etc. as I understand I could still be a carrier and give it to other people. Finally, Boris has got is sorted, the road map seems to be working and of course, he can stop it at any time if the infection rate goes up. I went into a town for the first time 7 months on Saturday and it was packed.  So, I wore my mask all the time. I am not concerned about the safety of the vaccine because blood clots can happen anyway as I know because my daughter had one recently causing a stroke and she had not had the jab and is only 46.  Now they are saying the Janssen vaccine my cause blood clots but I donâ€™t think they really know it is the vaccine that causes them. The vaccine programme Unfortunately, as I have not entered the programme because of above, I do not know how it is being delivered locally. My brother who lives in a different district council area to me explained he just went to a test centre, did not have to wait long and it was all very efficient. I do believe key workers should be vaccinated first as they are dealing with Covid patients or in the public domain every day. I also felt teachers should have been vaccinated before the children went back to school. I think a lot of older people who are generally healthy, like me, would wait for their turn, if people who are at work had their vaccine first because that makes sense. I watch the news every day and the Coronavirus updates by the government to keep up to date with the situation. Making vaccines mandatory I think it is a good idea to have a vaccine passport, why not? It makes sense.  I have got my letter proving I had my jabs and both my brothers were given a card to indicate they had and they could be used. If we are to travel again and allow travellers into the UK.  I think we need to allay fears when we go to another country and have our fears allayed when people visit us.  Until the whole world is vaccinated we are still not safe. I think a Covid-19 vaccine should be mandatory."

Mass-Observer L7499 describes themself as female; age 69; divorced; virtual assistant / semi-retired.;The Directive 'COVID-19 and Time' was issued on 7 August 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in relation to the 'rhythm and routine of the day'; 'homelife'; use of 'media and technology'; their experiences of 'waiting'.,"Part 1: Covid-19 and Time  Rhythm and Routine of the Day In the first days of lockdown I think I was in shock as I lost all my work. I then went overboard finding things to do, overdid it and got really stressed. I was fine staying in as I work from home a lot anyway. Disappointed though as I had various arrangements made with my family and friends.    Time in my day has not really been disrupted other than I have more time to myself as my workload decreased.  Some work is coming back but one of my jobs involved travelling all over Leicestershire so that has stopped permanently which means I am at home all the time apart from a job I regained involving doing viewings of properties so this means I go out and meet people (behind masks of course) and is something I enjoy.   However, I do sit at my PC for most of the day in the week.  I have now completed an Interior Design course and a Criminology and Profiling course.  I am still on my Cognitive Behavourial Therapy course and have started an SEO course to help improve my website with a view to gaining more work.  I am also having hypnotherapy for a small problem I have and this seems to have made me feel happier.   I do have a routine every day but it can be changed easily. I have not noticed any environmental specialities as I live in the country and was already taking walks round my village and have now have found more routes to go. I spend the same amount of time in my garden fighting with my buddleia bushes!  Homelife It is quite organised.  I work all morning, stop at mid-day, have lunch and then play games on my mobile for an hour so.  Back to my PC and it may be work I am doing or my courses or something creative. I stop around 5pm and make my evening meal. At 7pm or later depending on the weather I go for walk.  I do not walk every day as I do indoor exercises with Mr Motivator or my own aerobic routine.  I then watch TV or make phone calls to family.  Go to bed around 11pm, read and sleep.  Before I got to bed I do my weights. This routine is more or less the same as before lockdown.   The weather can influence my use of time, if I know it might rain in the evening, I go for my walk in the afternoon.  I do not really anticipate much change in my homelife in the future other than seeing family and friends face to face.   Media and Technology I have used Zoom a lot for chatting to my brothers, village meetings and my hypnotherapy.  I did have to shop online at one point when Leicester was locked down because I live in a village outside Leicester which was not locked down and could not go into Leicester where the supermarkets are to shop.    I have always used, planners and diaries and more so as I have got older, with no memory, I have a paper diary, a wall planner and online calendar which links to my phone. I have notepads when taking calls and a bullet journal that lists my tasks for the day and what I have achieved in the day.  I write a journal/diary every day using my bullet journal to remind me what I did!  I also type a journal every so often that summaries events and how I feel.  My views on social media have not changed from the Spring Directive.  Once, we are out of lockdown completely, I will probably not use Zoom so much but everything else, I shall continue as is.   Waiting I am not a patient person but just before lockdown I had a small car accident (not my fault); had to renew my driving licence,; got a penalty fine for driving too fast and ordered a new sofa, all of which got held up because of Covid-19. This involved some chasing of the insurance company, DVLA only dealing with key workers, sofa nothing I could do, penalty charge involved several emails and the driver workshop which was the option I chose was eventually done via Zoom.  Everything came to fruition in July.  I realised that everything comes to those who wait!   Shopping -  I found the best time to go to supermarkets so I did not have to wait too long.  Waiting for some lengths of time outside other shops, I was impressed how everyone was, quiet, accepting, no problem.  I was impressed totally how everyone took the lockdown on board and followed the rules i.e. up until recently where it has all gone very wrong.  I did have a telephone appointment with my doctor but then had to go in and he could not administer the treatment I needed as it might compromise my immune system so I have to wait until the virus is completely over or there are vaccines before I can have this done.   Sadly, my ex-husband died on Good Friday of Covid-19.  He did have underlying health issues with his lungs and heart, he was 70.  We have been divorced since 1983 but have still seen each other on occasions as we have two daughters who of course, were devastated. I was also more upset than I anticipated.   There were only five people allowed at the funeral so my daughters could not attend as the five people had either already had the virus and included his wife and sister.  We were together for sixteen years and I do still feel sad now."

Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). Part 3: The COVID-19 Vaccine When the first COVID-19 submission reached us in March 2020, it felt as if a vaccine was a long way off and â€˜lockdownâ€™ was the new normal. However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I went to my GP surgery on a Saturday morning (surgery is closed at the weekend). Patients went in one door, gave details to a volunteer who checked a list, then were allowed into the main waiting area where 3 or 4 vaccination stations had been set up. When we had our jabs we had to sit in a particular place for 15 minutes then go to another desk to collect appointment cards for the second jab. My husband drove me so I could go straight home, but those who drove themselves were told to sit in their cars for a further 10 minutes and if they felt ill to beep their horns and keep their hand on it until someone came out to them. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? A sore arm (at the vaccination site) for a few weeks. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVIDÂ­19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? I am still following Welsh Government guidelines. My husband goes supermarket shopping; Iâ€™ve not been inside a shop since last October (2020). I have met my brother outside only and for a short time. I have not met up with friends and will not be visiting any pubs or restaurants, sporting events, going High Street shopping or booking holiday accommodation for the foreseeable future. I wear a mask when I collect medication from the GP surgery pharmacy, and when I pop into our local CoÂ­op for some shopping. The only time I have been with a group of people was when we planted apple trees at the allotments at the end of March, and even then I backed away if people came too close to me. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? 7 M-O Number: O7396 Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). I was concerned when I hears that the OAZ vaccine might be a cause of blood clots in some people, which came out just before I had my first jab. But the greater benefit of having it must surely outweigh any slight chance of blot clots. Of course, if it happens to me, I might think differently. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme. (e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). We have a few mass vaccination centres in the area, but I didnâ€™t have to attend any so cannot say how they worked.  Here in Wales, we seem to be on target, though there have been a couple of times when the vaccine provision has slowed. We are slightly behind England as we are still, as far as I know, vaccinating 50+ age group (England was 45+ last I heard). I do know that between my husbandâ€™s group and mine, they were vaccinating vulnerable groups (younger but with health conditions). Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. BBC Wales news programmes, BBC Breakfast, Wales First Ministerâ€™s weekly briefings, or I look it up online. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both CovidÂ­19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. With all the Covid variants springing up around the world and coming into Britain, my gut reaction is that NO-ONE should be thinking about travelling abroad just for a holiday. I am against vaccine passports in principle, especially for something like pubs and sporting events. It will be divisive and create a them and us scenario. How will they treat people who donâ€™t have one because they canâ€™t have the vaccine for medical reasons? Before they consider vaccine passports, the government must have plans in place to be able to react quickly to a third wave which I fully expect to happen the minute large numbers of people start moving between countries. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? A difficult question to answer. Vaccinations save a lot of lives and weâ€™ve seen reports that some childhood diseases have returned because some parents refused to have 8 M-O Number: O7396 Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). their children vaccinated or donâ€™t have access to vaccines (due to cost or political/religious reasons). My heart says everyone who can, should have a Covid vaccination; my head says that making vaccines compulsory is the slippery slope to a totalitarian state and the loss of civil and human rights. Itâ€™s impossible to choose. 9"

Once the over 50â€™s group were told they could be vaccinated on 17th March, my GPâ€™s practice were quick off the mark and by lunchtime the same day my husband and I had both received text messages asking us to contact the surgery to make appointments for vaccinations two days later. Excitedly, I rang the practice only to find the phone lines engaged as probably all 50â€“54-year-olds registered to the practice were all ringing at the same time. So I went out for a walk and had my mobile set to keep trying the surgery and about two hours after the original text message, my call was answered and two minutes later we had appointments booked for 19th March. It felt such a huge relief to have finally been invited for a vaccination and knowing that my parents had already had their first, and my daughters would not get called for a while, it felt as though our family were making good progress. On the 19th, with me quite excited and J calm as he always is, my husband and I drove to the GP practice, in the centre of our town and only five minutes away from home. There was a huge queue outside in the car park for people waiting to receive vaccinations from the adjoining pharmacy but we were ushered into the surgery waiting room, not another person in sight apart from the receptionist behind her screen. We stood waiting for only a couple of minutes before both being called in at the same time by two practice nurses. Once in the consultation room, the nurse asked all the relevant questions, gave all the important information about the vaccine and within about 4 minutes, I had received my first Astra Zeneca vaccination. As I made my way out of the practice following the one-way system, about eight consultation rooms were in use, with nurses and doctors â€˜jabbingâ€™ all those coming through for their vaccines. Once outside, still full of excitement, I saw J sitting in the car and joined him, to realise the one piece of information he had been given and I hadnâ€™t, was about sitting for ten minutes before driving home in case of any reaction. As I expected, I looked at J, asked if we were going to wait, only for his â€˜it will be alrightâ€™ attitude to kick in and we drove home straight away. I suffered no side effects from the vaccine, whereas J did feel tired and sore later that evening and during the night, also having a sleep during the following afternoon while still feeling a little out of sorts. Even having been double vaccinated, I am still following the guidelines around social distancing and mask wearing, as much about protecting others as well as myself. I understand that restrictions have to be lessened at some point, but I maybe disagree with the speed in which the Government are moving ahead with this. I might have preferred more frequent and smaller steps down in the lessening of restrictions, but realise that just because we are legally allowed to do something does not mean we have to do it. I might be allowed to a cinema, a shopping centre etc. but I will do it in my own time. I have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine I received even though there have been concerns about blood clots and other side effects. There are risks and side effects with most medicine and drugs and once I had weighed up the benefit of being vaccinated versus being very ill with Covid, I was more than happy to be vaccinated. In my immediate area, vaccines are predominantly being delivered via certain GP practice and local pharmacies. Their systems appear to be well organised, following national guidelines about the setÂ­up. I am aware of people older than I am who received invitations to book appointments via the national NHS app for their vaccinations and were being offered appointments at large centres, often up to a couple of hours away from home. I was pleased not to have had to travel so far and would not have wanted to queue for a long time at a sports ground or similarly large venue among many people â€“ would that queue have been the place I was likely to catch Covid? Interestingly, my own invitation to use the national NHS app to book for my first vaccination came in the post about a week after I had received my first dose. My information about the vaccines has come from various print and online media sources, but I have tried to avoid reading too widely for fear of finding so many small details that I was not happy with that I would worry about receiving the vaccine. I donâ€™t have a medical background and donâ€™t understand all the finer medical detail about the vaccine so I stayed with mainstream reporting of the vaccines and did not seek out opinion around the world, as a few people I know did. I have no issues with carrying a vaccine passport to allow freedom of movement, but can see how those choosing not to be vaccinated fear they will be disenfranchised. However, in such a global reaching pandemic, and with the prospect of itâ€™s consequences being felt for a long time to come, those who are against a vaccination passport should think more about the moral duty we all have to each other to be vaccinated and provide protection, step up and do the right thing, and then carry a passport with pride."

Married to another woman. I live in a small village in Saddleworth near Oldham. I am a retired Detective Police Officer. SUMMER DIRECTIVE PART 1. COVID TESTING. I have only taken 1 test. It was in early July 2021 and was sent to me by University College Hospital as part of their research project to measure infection in the community. Participants are selected at random. They initially wrote to me explaining the process and asking if I would participate. I then had to click on a website link and register and they then posted the test to me. Before agreeing to it I did think about it and discuss it with my wife. She had done a similar test last year but that was to test for anti bodies. She felt it was a good thing to help the research. I agreed but a tiny part of me thought that by taking it I didn't want to actually discover that I had it. We have been extremely careful throughout the pandemic and have fallen into an approach where we have avoided other people and social meetings,wear masks indoors at businesses and use disinfectant regularly and hand wash. I have been frightened of catching it . I have had both vaccines . So the test kit arrived by post with clear instructions. There was a timeframe of about 8 days to do it and I chose to do it so that IF it came back positive it wouldn't impact a planned trip in our camper van if I had to isolate. I read all the instructions and the first thing I had to do was go online and book a courier pick up slot for the day I planned to do the test. On the day I set my alarm for 0730 as it said do the test before 0800. The night before I checked i had all the stuff and read the instructions so i knew what to do. In the morning I took the test in my bathroom. I washed my hands first and carefully opened the swab kit . I have taken hundreds of dna swabs from people when I was working so am used to being careful to not contaminate a swab. I did the test in the mirror initially doing the throat swipe. It wasn't nice and made me retch a little as I have a strong gag reflex. I then did the second swipe up my nostril which wasn't as bad but I did think id rather not be putting swabs up my nose either. I sealed the swab tube and labelled it and then sealed it in the sample bag and then the outer bag. Packed it in the cardboard box with the post label on it. I put the security seal on it and then put it in my fridge. I then went back to sleep. I received a text to say the courier would attend between 10;40-12;40 and got up again at 10;00. the courier arrived at 11;00. he knocked on the door and stood back when i opened it. I handed him the sealed package and he left. I received my result of negative 8 days later by post. I was 99.5% sure it would be negative as Ive been so cautious but you still have that tiny doubt. I felt relieved it was negative and also that I,d done a good thing participating. I face timed my wife to tell her the result. I did joke with her that it was official that I wasn't pregnant at first. I found the process easy to do and I took it seriously . I didn't enjoy it and feel sorry for all the people who have had to do them constantly. I do wonder if they couldn't design an easier test,especially for kids . I read that they have been testing sewage to predict rates so can they not do some sort of test that is less intrusive. My views on the test and trace system is that they don't appear to have done it in an effective way. The app cost a fortune but they were not tracing 100% of contacts. I think they should have closed our borders and rigidly enforced it . Quarantine should have been mandatory and involved regular testing. The farce of the football VIPs being allowed in made a joke of it all. Going forward testing is going to be a big thing. I really hope it doesn't become a money making exercise . Tests should be cheap,swift and effective. I have some concern hearing that people who have been double jabbed and have become infected but had to take multiple tests when they felt ill which showed negative. Like the journalist MARR. He wasn't convinced he was negative and it took 3 tests. so it makes me wonder how reliable they are. How reliable are the test labs ? Are their staff properly trained,are they overworked and cutting corners ? It is really important that they are done properly. I have also heard that there has been problems with people forging negative test result certificates so they can travel. That is disgusting and puts honest people at risk and needs punishing to the max. For the future what will testing look like. Can sniffer dogs detect it at airports or train stations for mass screening ? makes me wonder . Not to do with testing but I am annoyed that one of the jabs  I have received was an  astra zeneca vaccine that was manufactured in India and now the EU aren't recognising it for travel. 5 million of us were given it unknowingly and if it prevents me being able to travel in the future I am going to be so angry. I was keen to be vaccinated but if id been told the batch would not be recognised I would have wanted a different vaccine.I am watching the news for an update as I need to travel next year to Europe. I may need to have an extra jab to resolve it . We shall see. 5.8.2021"

REGARDING COVID 19 IMPACT ON MY LIFE IN 2020. This covers the period 4/5/20-1/6/20. I am 53 years old female living in ,a very small village in Saddleworth. . Married but chooseto live separately from my wife for most of the week. Retired Detective Police of.cer. HEALTH. When this .rst started late December/early January I had seen the news from China. I had neverheard of Wuhan. I wrongly,and maybe sel.shly assumed it would not affect me. The SARS virus was an Asian problem . We had booked a road and train trip in the USA to celebrate my wife,s 60th and in the lead up to our departure there was no direction to NOT travel. I think the day before we left there had been 1 UK death and they were quarantining anyone who came back from cruiseships. So we went away feeling it would be ok but we were hand washing more and had sanitiserwith us. Whilst in the USA over the next 10 days things deteriorated globally . The World Health Organisation declared a pandemic . I became most concerned when the idiot President Trump said he was stopping all European .ights.Two days later when he said he was thinking about stopping UK .ights we booked urgent .ights home using American airlines. It cost us £760 which we gladly paid. Online British airways wanted £3000. ! I have never been so glad to arrive in Manchester on the full plane from Philadelphia. Whilst wewere in the air American airlines announced it was stopping ALL of its long haul .ights.In my head I thought if there was a time I was going to catch Covid it would be on that full plane.For the next two weeks I was worried and relieved when I remained well. I am usually healthy and have always been strong. Rarely at the doctors. I had a hysterectomy 7years ago after suffering for years and years with painful and very heavy periods. Since then I have been really good. For the last year or so I think I am in the menopause having hot .ushes mostly atnight.My wife has a rare condition Ehler dans syndrome. She has a faulty heart valve,her joints dislocateeasily and she bruises badly easily. She is asthmatic and has a thyroid condition so she would be classed as having underlying health conditions. Since we returned she was advised to isolate andwork from home for 12 weeks. She was relieved and so was I as being at home she is safe. A few of my friends or their families have been ill with what sound like covid symptoms but have not been tested and have reported feeling really rough at home.My sister in law (oldest brothers .rst wife ) is a nurse in a general practice in Surrey. She has been tested positive and told me she felt rough ,acheing .tired and lost her sense of smell and taste inthe .rst 10 days . Then she said she felt better and was talking about returning to work. Her second week she said she felt really poorly with it and it had wiped her out. She remained at home.I have been worried for her. As for my emotions since this started. It has been frightening . Things just seem to have gone crazy in a short few weeks. The massive death toll rising on the news has made me feel fearful for our lives. My wife and I have had a frank discussion about our wishes if we got ill. What we wantfor resuscitation or ventilation. Also what if one of us dies and that we would want the other to be happy in the future. We both already had wills made and I have had a funeral plan in place for years. The fact that we feel the need to say these things to each other demonstrates how bad things are.I have felt generally worried and that things are out of my control and the govt,s control.In my life I think the .rst other time I felt like society was losing control was the .nancial crash of2008 . I was really shocked when banks were talking about not letting people have their ownmoney. Perhaps naively I thought that could never happen. I was also on duty when the riots were happening and petrol bombs were being thrown at Police . Now it makes me feel how fragile ourworld really is. I have felt tearful more than usual but I am normally emotional and cry at the slightest sentimentalthing anyway. Now anything about the NHS makes me .ll up. I have felt proud and emotional during the weekly clap for carers .I have written Thank you NHS on my England .ag from the rugby. Each Thursday at 8pm I have stood on my front doorstep and either side of me my neighbours have been there. All across the small valley you can hear clapping,people banging pans ,.reworks and the church bell on the hill just above my home rings.There are two horses living in the .eld on the opposite side of the road to my house. They have got excited each week and gallop about almost as if they are joining in.I have had a lump in my throat each time.My neighbours and I have all agreed that it makes us feel connected and gives us some strength.Then when you see the TV coverage all over the country it is amazing how many people take part.The sense of we are all .ghting this together is palpable to me. I am not generally prone to feeling depressed and would only feel down about a speci.c issue for ashort time and am glad that it is not something I suffer from. During this I have felt a sort of sadness about it all ,not a massive percentage of my thoughts but like wearing heavy boots if thatmakes any sense.My biggest fear is my wife getting ill and then me so I have felt scared for us.To combat that we have decided our plan is we both isolate in our separate homes. I am making sure I am not taking risks with contact with anyone so I can see my wife ,we have agreed every 3weeks. We need to maintain our relationship and support each other and although it feels too long and we miss each other its a safe option. My wife is an only child and her 89 year old mum has dementia. She lives alone in Wales and before this we would travel most weekends to see her,do her shopping and make her a lunch.So since lockdown so far we have been there twice. We have worn masks and gloves and kept her away from us in her lounge. She has 3 care visits a day so they and she may be a risk to us.We have done the quickest restock shop and fridge/freezer re.ll and then left .We cant just abandon her and she doesn't really grasp what is going on.I have felt worried about how we manage her and keep ourselves safe. GOVERNMENT. I voted Tory in the last election. Mainly because I detested Corbyn the now former Labour leader. My brother was a soldier and blown up by a vehicle bomb in the 70,s. He survived but severalpeople including women and kids did not. As a result I loathe the support given to the IRA by CORBYN and would never vote for them with him in charge.The lib democrats lost the plot as well so it was the best of a bad bunch.Boris JOHNSON is ,in my opinion a rich,privileged,womanising bluffer but he is the Prime minister.I was mostly just relieved they had a majority and could get something done,anything ,done afterthree years of the hamster wheel around Brexit. So my view of how they have done is mixed.On the economy help and furloughs the previously unknown Mr Sunak seems to have done reallywell. To be supporting so many people is unprecedented. I dread to think how we pay it all back though.Building the nightingale hospitals was impressive but I hope they won't be white elephant projectsin the end . I like that the daily brie.ngs happen so we can be informed but they are a depressing subject.I am reassured by Professor Witty. He looks like a real bof.n with his big forehead and geeky dress sense. He comes across as honest and well informed. I am not impressed with the PPE issues. Surely in late January they could anticipate they weregoing to need loads and should have been ordering anything and everything. Then saying they were waiting for delayed .ights from Turkey. We have a Royal air force . They should have been .ying lots of supply .ights using them.then they were slow to accept the offer of British .rms making it. Going forward they should ensure the contracts go to British companies as a priority.Testing is also an issue. I wish they'd just be honest and say we have managed X amount and we are really trying to increase and will let you know instead of bullshit about aspirational targets andcapacity .I am really keen for an antibody test to be available. I am very curious to know if I haveany as I have not felt ill. I think the biggest failure is going to be care homes. I think they should have focused 2/3 of efforts to frontline NHS and 1/3 to care homes. But they didn't and in the end I think the .gures will showthousands of old people dead. A lost generation .I think they were reluctant to step in because the care homes tend to be privately owned. It shouldnot matter. a health emergency is in place.I predict this will be their biggest weakness in how they responded. Sadly.They should have also closed our borders. We are an island and should use that to our advantage but we have not done so. Next steps. I think they will have to ease the lockdown to get the economy going again. They cant pay furlough for 1/4 of the UK workforce for too long.I think they will start mid may with maybe garden centres,recycling,building sites and then earlyJune limited schools.Football behind closed doors. I think older people are in lockdown for many many months.I wouldn't be surprised if they aim for some sort of Christmas pub easing .Travel next summer. Boris JOHNSON,s announcement 10/5/20 was a change in message from Stay home to stay alert.I think myself and many others found it confusing . The intention is to start getting people back to work. I think they are also relying on the common sense of the public. That scares me. After a long career dealing with the general public I have seen many times that a proportion of society haveabsolutely no common sense or regard for others. Whilst the lockdown has been on there havebeen numerous examples of police of.cers being spat at or bitten deliberately. There have also been lots of examples of people defying the rules. They can't deal with the word NO and will not obey,even if it is necessary to preserve lives as they have a sel.sh view of life and do whatever they want to do.I also think it makes things harder that there are different restrictions and messages in Wales,Scotland and England. We travel regularly in normal times to Wales to look after my mother in law so different rules to follow is an issue.I also think Nicola Sturgeon and the Welsh assembly are playing some power politics in it which is wrong in my opinion. I also wonder if China is going to suffer any consequences in the future. Will they pay any compensation or will they be forced to clean up their markets ?The misinformation campaign has already started and they seem to be trying to deny that itoriginated there and blaming the Americans. NEWS. I normally follow the news closely. Now it is such a looming presence. It feels like a constant bad news day . The death toll numbers are so bad. I trained as family liaison of.cer to assist bereaved families in murders and natural disasters ,the scale of that loss and its impact is just too enormousto contemplate.People not being able to say goodbye or attend funerals will have a bad effect in the future.I think a tsunami of PTSD is inevitable for NHS and frontline staff in the coming years.I look at BBC news online and have been watching the daily brie.ng on BBC . I also watch skynews in the day. The brie.ngs are a good thing but a tough watch. I sort of brace myself for the numbers every day.Some ministers are better than others. I .nd GOVE very pompous and waf.es a lot.Dominic Raab comes across fairly well and Matt Hancock but at times it is obvious they are justrepeating the script especially around PPE problems.My favourite is Professor Witty who is very reassuring for some reason.I also see social media like Facebook but I take that with a pinch of salt.I discuss events in other countries where my friends live for their perspective too. I saw the petition for BSL interpreter like the Scottish brie.ngs. I,m not sure why London don't think they should have them. Deaf people should get the brie.ng too. As long as it isn't that guy who did the Nelson Mandela funeral in South Africa…he was hilarious but soo wrong just making it up as he went along. I was really shocked by the news that Boris JOHNSON was in ICU. I may not agree with hisbehaviour at times but I did not want him to die. It made it feel like we were even more out of control. I was relieved and glad when he came out of hospital and back to work. As for the statistics. The phrase “ Lies,damn lies and statistics “ springs to mind. I cannot believe that China has had as few as 3000 deaths as it claims and as of 5/5/20 we havehad 30000 deaths in the UK. How can we have 10% of the worlds deaths ? I think our govt made an error in initially only releasing deaths of con.rmed deaths in hospitals .Under pressure they have eventually after 6 weeks started releasing them in all settings but theseare test con.rmed or suspected on death certi.cates. They are not testing every dead person so we will never really know the true .gure here or elsewhere in the world. WORK AND HOME LIFE. Being retired I am not working. I was also not willing to return to work following the recent requestsince the crisis. Mainly because in my latter years I felt the Police Organisation did not care aboutthe staff,especially in welfare around burn out or stress. In addition during my service 3 of my close colleagues were shot dead in 2 different incidents. This was a traumatic experience and took a toll on me . They said if staff returned our pensions would be stopped and we would be paid a basic hourly rate . More reasons why I was unwilling to be cannon fodder . So lockdown has changed my routine in that normally I would be busy going to the cinema ormeeting friends for lunch/coffee/meals etc. Sometimes I take the camper van away midweek to the lake district or wherever for a couple of days. But none of that is possible so I,m at home all thetime now. Which is a bit boring some days. I am really yearning to get my hair cut. It is getting longer and more unruly by the day and also much greyer. My wife is a social worker and would normally work at home 2 or 3 days a week but is now full-timeat home. She is really enjoying it and feels safe so that makes me feel relieved. TECHNOLOGY. I think technology,especially the internet has been a godsend in the crisis.Normally my wife and I because we live apart half the week communicate using FaceTime a few times per day. Since lockdown we have been using it much more and it has been reassuring to be able to chat and connect. I have also chatted to my brother and family and my best friend inSydney using it.I also use Facebook messenger and e mails to keep in touch with my other friends. It,s beeninteresting hearing the accounts from friends in New Zealand,Spain,Bosnia and Sweden of howtheir lockdown is similar or different to us. My wife and I have also gone old school and exchanged some letters by post as we were bothmissing each other. Love letters straight from the heart and all that.I think social media can be a negative thing normally but for once it seems to be a source ofcontact and daft videos to cheer us up. The proposed contact tracing app will mean I have to change my phone. I have a very basichandset which I hardly ever use and keep in case I break down. I will need to be able to downloadthe app so may have to use an old handset I have. I used the online ordering system to send a Cornish clotted cream tea for one to my mother in law. She loved it. The company is a small family run business so it was good to use them. SHOPPING. Since lockdown my shopping has changed dramatically. I have used the good local butcher 1/2 mile away . There has only been me in there each time I went. I have also used local deliveries of fruit and veg boxes and a brewery who teamed up with a bakers and farm .I managed eventually after a month to get a Tesco click and collect slot which was great as I pulled up and they put the bags straight in the boot of the car. The second time I used it was like a formula 1 pit stop. I was in and out in 90 seconds .at. Fabulous. I am basically trying to limit my risk to the absolute minimum so I don't put my wife or mother in lawat risk. I have ordered a couple of things from Amazon like a new book written by a teenage girl survivor of the Manchester bomb. The only problems early days were as a result of other people panic buying you couldn't buy toiletroll or pasta. I had some so I managed and bought a small amount when I could.I love cooking and would describe myself as foodie. I have made sure I don't waste anything. Iorganised my cupboard and freezer so I could menu plan. I have enjoyed planning and cookingnice tasty food to brighten up my lockdown. ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE. 2020 is going to be the year that was OFF.I like watching sports. My absolute favourite is the 6 Nations Rugby . I am an avid viewer wearingmy England shirt and enjoying friendly banter with my Welsh wife. Sadly this years tournament never .nished. I follow women,s football and played myself for a local team in my late 20,s . Cant believe thedifference now. All football is off too. I attended the 2018 Commonwealth games in Australia and loved it. I was so looking forward to watching the years Olympics.This week we were booked to attend the Invictus games for injured veterans in the Hague but thatis also cancelled. KLM are refusing to refund our .ights despite EU law and a £9 billion bail out.They have promised a voucher and a refund in a year.Thanks for nothing.. We have  2 week long trips in the camper van planned for July and September. I don't think we will be going. I cannot MOT the van either but have 6 months extension which is a weird scenario. So we have paid for tax,insurance and storage but cannot use it. Our normal activity on a Friday is to go to our local old pub early ,about 5pm and have 2 pints ofKronenburg. 3 if we are staying out a bit and then go back for dinner at home. We miss this and our landlord friend. Cant wait to sit in the beer garden again.As an alternative in the last couple of weeks on a Friday we have had a FaceTime call and then my wife has put her phone on the fence to her neighbours back garden who are our friends so I havebeen able to chat to her and them and we have all had a beer in a virtual conference call. That has felt nice. On VE day 75th anniversary I watched online on FaceTime as my wife neighbours had put up bunting and one of them played cello in their garden. That was nice to see but also gave me big twinges of missing being there. My other favourite activity is to go to the cinema,at least once a week. I love to escape intowhatever .lm on my own usually in the afternoon. I get a costa coffee and sometimes a small popcorn and watch the latest .lm. I have an unlimited membership with Odeon and sometimestreat myself to the arty cinema at HOME or Everyman. I am missing the cinema a lot. I am watching lots of Tv. On BBC player the fabulous Killing Eve season 3. I love the cat and mouse between Villanelle and Eve. It is funny and shocking all at once. Excellent script.They release an episode on Monday which is good and avoids me binge watching it all in one go.I have also been enjoying watching .Race across the world where two teams cross a continent without .ying is good. The Patagonian scenery looks stunning but also reminds you we cannot travel any time soon. Net.ix £6 a month is coming in handy too. Very much enjoyed A Secret Love . True documentary about 2 Canadian women living in Chicago who had been a secret couple for 70 years !Then they needed a care home together and told their families. It was so sweet and sad. Their old photos and that they tore their names off the end of their love letters so no one would know were heart wrenching. It was a very human and af.rming .lm. Made us feel lucky we haven,t had to livelike that. I have been reading the latest girl with the dragon tattoo book and one called Lone Rider aboutElspeth Beard the .rst British woman to ride around the world on a motorbike. Brave and a bit madI think. I really enjoy listening to the Coronacast newscast from the BBC. I like the team on it especiallyLaura Kuennsberg. It started off as Brexitcast,then election cast and now the virus. It is informative each night and at times funny. I like to listen to it lying down with my eyes closed. Despite the tough subject I .nd it a calm experience to stop and listen to it. I have been setting myself daily chores around the house. The countries household tasks will never have been so well done. As a new thing I signed up to do this (7 weeks into lockdown ). It is something interesting to occupysome time and writing down how I have felt about this all is probably cathartic.Hopefully in the future it will be a record to others of this crazy time. I go for my permitted daily walk maybe every other day. 20-40 minutes around the local neighbourhood which is very quiet and everyones garden is looking well tended.I have also done a few minutes exercise at home in the lounge maybe dancing about to music for10 minutes doing some exercise. PERSONAL HYGIENE. The crisis hasn't changed my normal shower and bath habits but it has changed my hand washing.In normal times obsessive repeated hand washing by me or others would make me concerned forOCD mental health,but now everyone is at it. I have never washed my hands so much.Especially if I go out. I carry a pack of disposable disinfectant wipes and clean the car steeringwheel when i get in and out. I avoid opening doors with my hands. I use hand sanitiser immediatelyafter touching anything outside or in shops . When i have got shopping home I have .lled the sinkwith soapy water and given tins,bottles etc a wash and then dry or if I cant wash the package put itout of the way for a few days or discarded exterior packaging.I have changed my clothes straight in the wash and then had a long shower and changed if I havebeen out to the shop. As a result I am limiting my shopping to the minimum as its a routine to clean yourself every timeand I feel like I,m at risk in what I call the contagion zone if I go out.I cant imagine how bad people who already had OCD issues about germs will be after all this andmany others may feel a bit more Ocd as a result.I have felt that I am taking some control to keep myself safe with the enhanced cleaning regime . SLEEP. I have always really enjoyed my sleep and could sleep anytime easily. No matter what shifts I worked. I need a good 10 hours sleep.Unlike my wife who no matter what is awake at 0600 everyday. If I don't get enough sleep I get grumpy and even worse if I,m hungry and tired I,m very grumpy so I need to be fed and snooze plenty to be content.About 3 weeks into lockdown I was struggling to sleep. i was worrying about it all. The enormity of it. Worrying that my wife may catch it,or me or her mum. Worrying is it ever going to end . Will they get a vaccine. What if they don't . What if we get back to some normality and China has a different outbreak from their continued wet markets and questionable choice of eating bats or pangolins.I recognised that not being able to sleep was a sign of being anxious about it all so I made aconscious effort to watch less news. made sure the bedroom was as dark as possible and a nice temperature . I moved my iPad away from the bedside so I wasn't tempted to check it and had abath or a mint tea before bed. After a few days this helped and I have slept fairly well since.I hear from other friends that they have had similar problems sleeping. ————————————————————————————————————————— A decision about how I want to continue to write this. So far I have written on the various topics above about how it all feels to me and the impacts.I have felt it has been cathartic to me to record it . I have considered the process and was wanting to set a deadline for myself. I know the crisis willgo on for a long time and it may be that I submit a further document but I have decided that I willwrite up to 1/6//20 and then submit this.From today 13/5/20 I will do a day scribble of things more around just how I feel as I have capturedthe bigger picture above. So today 13/5/20 it feels quite uncertain. There are differing instructions in England ,Wales and Scotland. It is starting to get political I think.I am not going out. I don't feel safe to do anything other than a short walk at the moment.I feel sorry for the police who will have no chance of controlling the behaviour of people who do notwant to comply as the rules are now so mixed.I feel really sad about the death .gures. Its just so dreadful that we have over 32k and are theworst in Europe.I,m trying to remain positive within our bubble that we have between me and my wife. We are both determined to survive this. From todays news it feels that the govt is urging people back to work as a tactic to boost theeconomy. We need to move the economy but at what cost will this come.I am also getting irritated by news conference experts who are really poor public speakers. There was one on before and his delivery included the sound of “ Err “ about every 4th or 5th word.It grates on my nerves. Someone from press relations should pull him aside and replay the videoand if he cannot deliver without doing it they should get someone who can. Maybe that is me justfeeling grumpy with it all. On a more positive note from today we are allowed unlimited exercise outside…yipee..! not that iwill be doing anything different. But it says we can drive somewhere to exercise. I might drive the 10 minutes to our camper van storage compound and turn the engine over whilsthaving a little walk about and a stretch next to it. Garden centres are allowed to open…i,m sure they will have queues and I have no interest. I,m .nishing my book What makes us stronger this afternoon and plan making crab linguine later. Thursday 14/5/20.Woke up this morning and the headline includes World Health Organisation say the virus may never go away and we may need to learn to live with it like HIV.Firstly thinking,wow that is depressing. I really want it to go away.Secondly it occurs that is massively easier for me to avoid HIV as the two are polar opposites interms of risk. New Zealand have released their lockdown. They only had 21 deaths. ( tragic for 21 families no doubt ) and so far we are more than 33k. I,m going for my usual short walk as the sun is shining but it is cold in the wind.Made roasted butternut squash and spinach curry for my dinner.The 8pm clap for carers and key workers AGAIN. The 8th time I have done it so far.My neighbours either side were out and my friend who lives at the farm on top of the hill in front ofmy house waved at us. 15/5/20.Friday.The question of the morning is “ Do cows snore ?”Because about 02:00 with my bedroom window open I could hear this weird repetitive noise. At .rst I wondered if it was the two horses in the .eld but then when I looked out and listened I realised it was coming from the farm 1/2 mile up on the hillside and they have cows. The only thing I could think was are they snoring. It just shows how quiet it is that I can hear it. I had to close my windowso it did not disturb me. When I wake in the morning and FaceTime my wife she tells me that overnight there have been several fraudulent transactions on her credit card for random amounts of £60-80 . She had been on the phone to her bank and almost £1500 has been attempted or made intransactions. They have stopped her card and replacing it and have launched a fraud enquiry.It is so annoying. I hate thieves and to be dishonest during this period is even sleazier.She has no idea how the card has been compromised as she never uses it for online purchases.I wonder if it is a bank employee.I,m angry about it but she is calm as they have reassured her they will refund it eventually.I,d love to be able to jump into work mode and hunt down the fraudsters . But I can’t.If you had a choice of imposing one major change to everyones lives,like a super power for me itwould be that everyone has to be honest. If that happened so many bad things just wouldn'thappen. Our normal Friday activity is to go to our local 17th century pub and have a couple of pints.However we cannot do this. So just after 5pm we have a FaceTime conference between my wife and I and then later we are joined by our friend A from Knebworth so we all raise a pint and have chat. She has been busy marking work as she is a lecturer in PE and older than me,due to retire. Technology is ever evolving and she uses several expletives about using Zoom,many of which start with the letter F.I joke with her asking if that is a correct technical term. we have a laugh and a couple of beers . Saturday 16/5/20 .Just after lunch I had a nice surprise. Two of my friends who are a couple knocked on my door. They were out for their walk and we had a nice chat from a safe distance with them stood on theother side of my car. It was nice to see someone and have a conversation. I popped out later for ten minutes. The local food bank made a Facebook appeal and had a drive through drop off on the car park of a local pub. I threw a few tins of things in a bag and stopped them off. I,m sure there are people in bad situations so I have enough to help a bit. Sunday 17/5/20.A nice cloudy day.Annoying to see on the news yesterday hundreds gathering in London parks to have a protestabout the lockdown,to oppose vaccines and general anti establishment rabble rousing.None of them staying apart and deliberately defying the law.Why do they have such contempt for the medics? I can understand not everyone agrees with thegovt handling ,I don't think they have done well. But by meeting like this they put themselves andothers at risk. The poor cops sent to police it have no choice .And opposing a vaccine ? Really…what is their solution to all this then ?It angers me seeing rent a mob doing their “Aren,t I cool and radical “ attention seeking nonsensewhen the rest of us are trying to do the right thing . Monday 18/5/20.Day 57 of the lockdown. We approach the start of the ninth week.Raining this morning. Not doing my walk in the wet.Watched episode 6 of Killing Eve. Only two more left in the series. The only interesting activity of my day being going to pick up my click and collect shopping at 4pm.It was very ef.cient again,in and out in 2 minutes. Having scampi and some potato salad for my tea. Also made a beef chilli so it can be left overnight and then I will put it in my slow cooker for tomorrows dinner. Chilli always tastes better the day after as the .avour develops. The daily brie.ng points of interest. Bad,bad ,bad…total con.rmed dead (tested) 34796 Uk.But better news,the 24 hour total is 160. This is the lowest it has been since lockdown.So that gives some hope. But the numbers lag at weekends .I just worry that the recent relaxing ofrules hasn't stored a spike in 3 weeks time.The news coverage gives such mixed messages. Some say there may not ever be a vaccine andothers say there are promising signs. AAAGH….some certainty would be so nice.it is feeling very groundhog day now almost in week nine.A positive is I am saving money as i,m not socialising. must put it to something nice when I can.something to look forward to in an abstract way for now. Tuesday 19/5/20. I had a short .ve minute drive to the nice nearby village to have my walk and some fresh air.I parked up near the canal towpath walk and there were lots of tiny new .uffy ducklings . It was really nice to see and made me feel cheerful. I watched them waddling about and following their mum. A couple of the local cafes have started takeaway coffee service and people were qu"

Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I went to Guys Hospital to receive the vaccine jab. I was given the option of St Thomas for the Astra Zeneca but chose Guys as it was easier on public transport. I was quite wary of the train journey but the appointment was on a Saturday, trains and stations were empty, although London Bridge station was still quite daunting. I had not been anywhere for some weeks and this was a challenge. There were no problems with the administration of the jab or organisation of the centre. It was extremely efficient with many volunteers helping. I do not know who administered the jab. I presumed she was a nurse. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Pfizer How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? I felt slightly under the weather for about four days. My arm was uncomfortable. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? I am still following guidance as regards social distancing and masks however where my adult daughters are concerned I have not followed guidance, seeing them indoors about once a week. I am happy with the timetable for easing restrictions, although as my youngest daughter is expecting a baby in the next few weeks I would like to be able to hug them both after the birth. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? I am not concerned about the safety of the vaccine at all. F7091 How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). There are many venues delivering the vaccine in my area. The local doctorâ€™s surgery was very busy at the beginning of the roll out but is now quieter. I think all key workers should be vaccinated as a priority group. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.  I get information from my newspaper â€“ the Guardian. I think there has been some mixed messages about the vaccine, particularly recently when the drop in cases has been said to be thanks to lockdown rather than the vaccine. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. I do not understand the need to go abroad in such a hurry. I think foreign travel should be discouraged until the world has reduced the threat of Covid-19 to the level of flu. If people absolutely must travel then they should be prepared to fulfil any regulations required of them. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? There already are some which are mandatory when visiting certain countries, regions. No one appears to have a problem with them. I do not know how these decisions were made as to what is mandatory and what is not."

However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? At one of the surgeries/health centres in my local town. Not the surgery I belong to. Who administered it? Volunteers outside the building checking people in and taking temperatures before entering the building , more people inside at checkpoints ushering along the route. Vaccination given by a nurse in uniform. What was the atmosphere like? Sense of efficiency and calm control. A friend and neighbour of mine was one of the volunteer ushers. I had not idea she was involved. I had not seen her for a long time and she was being very officious and serious which is really not her â€“ so it felt quite weird. She asked me how I had got there and if I would be OK getting home â€“ she sometimes gives me lifts â€“ I use a walking stick -I assured her I was fine as I was concerned about us keeping ourselves safe. At this time overhearing our conversation a woman who was also being vaccinated â€“ a complete stranger asked if I needed a lift anywhere â€“ we both looked at her as if she was insane and I declined. Sitting in the tent seemed strange and I saw a few familiar faces also having vaccinations and volunteering. How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? On foot. When I was in better physical health this would have been an easy walk for me â€“ downhill nearly all the way and increasing steepness on the return trip. I do not drive and have not passed my driving test and my spouse was at a hospital scan appointment. I did not want to risk the health of friends and family who had not yet been allocated their appointments. Nor did I want to risk taking a taxi so I walked in both directions. I am not able to walk back without Access to Art & Design Graduate 2021/Homemaker â€“ former Magazine Advert Production Manager consequences. It was a slightly drizzly day and I was damp, thoroughly exhausted in a lot of pain and tearful when I got home and had to retire to be by teatime. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Pfizer. How did you feel after the vaccine? Physically drained by the journey but absolutely fine re vaccination. No worse than my annual flu jab. Did you experience any side effects? Day three after the vaccination and for the following three weeks I felt appalling. As if I was experiencing the first few weeks of ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome all over again. I was too bedraggled to be alarmed or care and was mostly bed bound. I was relieved to start to make a recovery and had just about achieved my normality in time for the second vaccination which had not side effects at all. I didnâ€™t even need paracetamol. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? Yes, I am doing all of the above. As is everyone in my household. I have some underlying medical conditions. In addition, my son, who is currently living at home, has only had his vaccination in the last few weeks, he works in a library and is in constant contact with the public. This makes him and us more susceptible to acquiring the virus with or without symptoms and wether we are fully vaccinated or not. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? I understand that society needs to get back to being as normal as possible but I will continue to wear my mask, social distance etc probably through to next Spring. I would not be surprised if there is another lockdown in the Autumn. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? No. Unfortunately, there will always be some that will have complications arising from the vaccination. I like to think that overall it is likely to do more good than harm. There are some diseases, such as smallpox, that have been wiped out thanks to the worldwide vaccination program so I believe vaccination can work and let us hope this is the case with Covid 19. If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine Will you accept an invitation to book the vaccine when it is offered to you? Please share your motivations for your decision.  Are you hoping to receive a particular vaccine? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Will you follow the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19? (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive the vaccine. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? By medical staff at existing medical centres. Some have come out of retirement and received refresher training to take part in the programme. Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). Roll out happened roughly as detailed in the proposed programme. I was alarmed and horrified that Postal Workers were not classified as key workers. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Smartphone via BBC News app with links to Government websites or via the NHS app which also has links to Government websites. Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.  All consuming. I wonder how many important news items have been missed and legislation been passed without us registering. Useful that health information is there in so many formats. I find graphs and tables very mind-boggling some more user-friendly/layman formats would be appreciated. There will always be sceptics, conspiracy theorists and nonÂ­believers. I think the experience of a loved one hospitalised by the condition might make them rethink. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. This may be a human rights issue. Perhaps simply have venues where the â€˜proud non-vaccinatorsâ€™ ONLY are welcome to attend so that those who choose to vaccinate might feel more safe. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? Probably not. Just provide fair and unbiased simple information about both the pros and the cons and illustrate the implications of both clearly."

Also currently staff at Vaccine Community Hub Spring 2021 Getting the Vaccine Today is Sunday 18th April. Iâ€™m due to get my first vaccine onFriday 23rd, not that itâ€™s a countdown or anything. I have to go to ahospital which is about 45 minutes drive away. I live very close to a vaccination centre where my husband (who is living with his parents as a carer at the moment) got his first vaccine three weeks ago today. Iâ€™m going to drive to the vaccine centre, which Iâ€™m told is in a portacabin in one of the hospital car parks. Tres glamourous. Iâ€™ll begetting the AstraZeneca vaccine. I have to go to the hospital to get it as itâ€™s arranged through my OccupationalHealth as Iâ€™m an essential worker in the Community Hub, delivering foodpackages to people who are often vulnerable. I still feel like Iâ€™m cheating. I gota message from my boss on WhatsApp telling me to call OH last Thursday night. I had to wait until Fridayto call and the man I spoke to said heâ€™d had lots of us calling. They are the OH for North Ayrshire Council, so I hope teachers are getting done as well. I donâ€™tthink itâ€™sfair that teachers have had to put themselves at such risk for so long without getting priority. I think in England theyâ€™re already vaccinating people my age, and I feel jealous of all the young Americans whoâ€™ve got the vaccine,but I do think the Scottish government is rightto do the vaccinations as theyâ€™re doing. I doubt I would have had long to wait as a 47 year old. Itâ€™s important to get a good amount of people vaccinated so it canâ€™t spread. My in laws are both very ill with blood cancers which affect their immune systems, and they managed to get it so I can too. I am following the government guidelines. I am pretty strict about it. I feel I have to do that with working in the Community Hub and all that, however, I do see others not following the guidelines, and barring a twinge of annoyance that they arenâ€™t, I donâ€™t really mind. My neighbours often have their family in and out of their house. My neighbour across the street caught Covid off her son who came to see her to get her to look after him while he was ill with fucking Covid, because heâ€™s so pathetic. His girlfriend was so unimpressedwith his behaviour that she chucked him out and so now heâ€™s back living withhis mum. Anyway! Back in October we had booked a holiday down in Yorkshire to see my family. At the time restrictions were pretty tight and I was expecting we would be cancelling, but Nicola Sturgeon said if we had holiday bookings we should go, so we went. I found Yorkshire very stressful. They were in a high tier of restrictions but people werenâ€™t socialdistancing very well, cafeâ€™s werenâ€™t set up like they are in Scotland with screens and proper distancing. We didnâ€™t go in a cafe and we ate all our meals in our AirBNB. We had a problem because they hadnâ€™t set up a bed for one of our children (every time we stay in an AirBNB we have this issue), and I called up, and the woman came and just walked the fuck into the property with no fucking mask on! My kids were bewildered and I got there and told her to back up. She obviously thought I was being over the top, but nobody does that here, nobody at all. Anyway, we got it sorted out. During that holiday we went to see my Mum -meeting her outside her house with the intention of going on a walk. On the way there there was a woman walking right up the middle of the pavement, not moving at all, and there was a car coming, so me and my kids tried to all get out of her way to keep distance, and I ended up tripping up, she sailed blithely on. I cut my knee really badly, and the kids were upset. My husband was shouting at the woman, which didn't really help. After that fiasco we got to my Mumâ€™s house. My sister was on the video chat there with them, waiting for me, so I got closer to my mum than I normally would, blood pouring down my leg, everyone fussing about me, and my sister told us she was pregnant! Oh my goodness. My mum just hugged me, and what could you do. We didnâ€™t kiss, and we normally would, but we did hug. We were both wearing masks, and she was getting tested weekly through some research. Anyway, after that I kind of wanted to hold her hand on our walk, but my husband said we shouldnâ€™tso wewalked and kept some distance, and kept our masks on. Now weâ€™re supposedto stay local but we can leave our council area for the first time in a long time, but where would we go? Weâ€™re so sick of walks. Shops are going to open up again in a while, but I get stressed out being too near people, and what do we need to buy?! Iâ€™ve been spending so much time trying to get rid of things. I am looking forward to getting rid of more stuff (Iâ€™ve stalledwith the charity shops shut, and not taking things), and to going to a cafe with friends. I am really missing having friends around. We usually have a Christmas party and wedidnâ€™t have that. I miss visiting people, people visiting us. Oh god, writing that made me cry. I know it makes sense to be slow, be careful, but it maddens me that theyâ€™re always going on about the economy. As if thatâ€™s all there is! We only started measuring the economy like this in the last 100 years or so, and now we put it above so much else. People are whatâ€™s important.I hope that as more people get vaccinated we can keep the levels low enough that we can visit people again, become more normal again. I think some things will always be different, and thatâ€™s probably for the best. I hope once people are vaccinated weâ€™re able to fly, because I would like my brother in law and hisfamily to be able to come here from Barcelona and see his parents before they die. I am not concerned about the safety of the vaccine. I believe it to be a lot safer than letting covid run rampant. I get information on the vaccine from trusted news sources like Radio 4, The Guardian, and BBC, although I donâ€™t tend to pay much attention to it. Themedia seems to have been a bit short on stories lately, theyâ€™lltry to stiranything up. I thinkitâ€™s really irresponsible to stop vaccinating people because of a very rare complication. Making vaccines mandatory I think generally anti-vaxxers are treated as if itâ€™s an acceptable way to be, when actually itâ€™s profoundly stupid, refusing to believe the clear evidence (although you canâ€™t argue someone out of a position they didnâ€™t arguethemselves into), and dangerous, not just for themselves, but for others, particularly vulnerable others. I think Cyprus is quite right to insist tourists have had both jags, I think that should be mandatory for all travel, to use public transport, to enter public buildings. Itâ€™s the same people who are kicking up a fuss about wearing a mask, and it maddens me how they can be determined to prove how selfish, insensitive, and stupid they are. That said, until under 18s are vaccinated, I donâ€™t think it would be fair for families.I donâ€™t think any vaccine should be mandatory, but just as peanutsare banned in schools where there is a child with a nut allergy, someone choosing to do something which may cause harm to another should not be tolerated. This is a particular issue for the MMR vaccine -people who could not have it have died and they were put at risk by idiots who refused to have it. Local authorities have to provide an education. Children in my town who need support with learning because of disabilities have to take a 40 minute drive to school. I think it would be reasonable to expect the same of children whose parents refuse to keep the population safe. I do think a lateral flow test before a flight or long journey would be completely reasonable. I donâ€™t think reasonable people want to spread coronavirus.Getting the vaccine -23/4/21 Today's the day! I'm annoyed at having to do a long round trip on a precious holiday to get it, but that's because there's a vaccination centre five minutes walk from my house. To be fair I'm just glad to be getting it. I am slightly worried about feeling ill afterwards but my husband's father is going into a hospice today, to give everyone a break (he's dying of multiple cancers, his wife is also dying of cancer but not as fast, my husband has been living with his parents since it became too much for them in February). This means my husband is coming home, so it's actually an ideal time to be ill! 10.42am My appointment is at 10.45. I went on autopilot on the way here, driving towards my daughter's riding school, so I'm on time but not as early as hoped. I find a tiny space in the car park and join a queue standing socially distanced in the car park. The car park on the other side of the building is a covid testing centre. Lots of signs. This is a portacabin with no signs in sight. I saw one of my colleagues walking away as I arrived. In front of me are a woman I don't know in jeans, vest, blue hoody, a scrumpled disposable mask in her hand, and a man in a red polo shirt, and a BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICE fluorescent tabard. He's holding a new disposable mask. Somebody comes to join the queue. It's my boss, who is always chatty. She tells me that another colleague came this morning and wasn't on the list, but they went ahead anyway. 11am I am called in by a friendly young nurse in trainers and scrubs and her hair up in a complicated bun. She asks me to fill out a consent form and gives me leaflets. She asks for my details and finds I'm not on the list. She tells me this. I say it's strange. She worries she won't have enough vaccines. She notes I have an appointment at my local vaccination centre on 20th May. I'd need to cancel that. Another nurse behind the curtain calls someone. They've got eight more doses coming. My nurse adds my name to the list, I get called through. I go through the questions I just answered on the consent form. The nurse tells me I'll have a sore, heavy arm, and I'll need to drink 50% more water. She asks if I've brought water. No, I promise to go get some. I won't. I'll go for a celebratory coffee. She tells me I'll need to wait in my car for ten minutes before I go, and I shouldn't put my jacket on. Ok. She gets me to let my arm hang down and she pinches me and gives me the vaccine. She apologises for it stinging. I laugh and tell her she could have punched me and I wouldn't have minded! I put my jacket on to walk to the car, set a timer for ten minutes and write this. The nurse asked me to cancel my other appointment, which she told me was due to be at my local vaccination clinic on 20th May. Iâ€™m grateful to be a month ahead of where I would be. I call from the car, and then drive to Costa for a celebratory hazelnut latte and a cheeze and quorn ham toastie. 4pm I feel a bit off, but OK. I am really glad to have had the vaccine. I am though thinking of my dentist and his nurse, who both came down with Covid just after having their vaccine. They must have contracted it before, but Iâ€™m going to keep being careful. My husband told me you get good antibodies from a week after the vaccine. Bring it on. From Monday we can order lateral flow tests to use at home. Two of my kids already use these twice a week. I think Iâ€™ll order some to use when they dotheirs on a Sunday night, before I go into work on a Monday. Sunday 25/4/21 I held off until today before sending this in, expecting to feel ill. I donâ€™t feel ill. Ido feel a bit thirsty and Iâ€™ve been drinking more as the nurse instructed, Iâ€™m also stressed out as my work has said Iâ€™llneed to be back all the time in the library from Monday, despite the fact that Iâ€™m currently doing two online groups a week which require me to not be in the library. They decided to throw me that curveball by email at 6.45pm on Friday night! But health wise, Iâ€™m fine. Slightly red where the injection ones, slightly sore, but not so I couldnâ€™t lie on it at night. Iâ€™m fine.Fingers crossed itâ€™s the same for the next one!"

We are just waiting for our appointments. We went to our local doctors luckily. Some people have had to travel miles to get theirs. It was really well organised. Thank god it was a dry day though as there was a queue outside even though you are given a time slot. It was quick to go in though. I think I mustâ€™ve only been outside for around 5 mins. They checked your temperature before you entered the building, made sure that you sanitised your hands and had on a mask. Within a couple of minutes the doctor came into the room and gave you the jab. Job done. I think there was around 2 or three doctors and they were basically taking it in turns going from one room to the next so it was quick. We had the Astra Zeneca (oxford). Everyone beforehand was saying that they were ill after having that one with flu like symptoms knocking them out for up to a fortnight. I just chucked some paracetamol down my throat every 4 hrs. For the first 24 hrs. and I was fine apart from a dead patch on my arm . Im still following guidelines and im still working from home. Im hoping to keep working from home as long as I can as I love it. I can do my work AND get the housework done all at the same time. None of that sitting in the office fretting cos youâ€™ve got a load on the line and itâ€™s raining or the opposite, itâ€™s a sunny day and you couldâ€™ve got your washing out. Itâ€™s great. I almost feel like semi-retirement. Im still tending not to go out much which is a good thing as itâ€™s saving me money. I just canâ€™t be bothered with the queues to get into places or just the extra time it takes to do stuff so I tend to stay at home and shop online instead. With something like this, i.e. a pandemic which is spreading so quickly I think that the vaccination should be mandatory if you want to continue a normal life. Yes you should be able to prove that youâ€™ve had both jabs if you want to travel abroad or in the future go to events. Maybe not have a passport as theyâ€™ve been on about but maybe a covid card with your registration number on it. Almost like your national insurance card. That way it can fit in your wallet, you can flash it, it has your number which is stored on a national database and so once scanned, youâ€™re good to go. Whatâ€™s wrong with that? The only thing annoying me at the moment is the fact that certain countries still wonâ€™t let you in. we were supposed to be going to Germany in September for a wedding of a lifelong friend. Despite by then us both having our both jabs (technically) they have closed the borders. However, if they opened it, they would want us to pay for a test before we go which is Â£250 and then another one when we are leaving to be organised there (How??) and then quarantine in a hotel here for 10 days paying separately for each person not per room as per the norm which would cost around Â£3,000 and then, have another test after that at another Â£250 each. Thatâ€™s disgusting. Talk about money making. Ive got a load of lateral flow tests that I ordered from the NHS the other week. I could take those and use those so why should I pay Â£250 to go and have one done at a test centre which would be the same thing? They need to sort something out with that. Surely if youâ€™ve had both vaccines and they are as good as they make out to be, then a lateral flow test when you fly should suffice, one as you go to leave the country you have gone to, an then another when you get back after 4 days maybe to be repeated after another 4 days (seeing that it can take 7 days to show up) should be enough. Someone like me who has pre prepared and got them already and enough to be able to do that, should be allowed to. They have the travellers track and trace scheme so they will know if we are back in the country and doing the tests so we should be penalised for doing the right thing surely"

However, since our last Direc+ve in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccina+on programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccina+ons. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccina+on programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who adminÂ­istered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I had my .rst vaccine on St Georgeâ€™s day 23rd April, the same day my father received his second dose.  As soon as the government said they had opened it up to over 45 I was online ge^ng a slot!  I was so pleased to get it and try and get things back to normal.  I went to Heathrow by car.  My satnav is out of date and I got hopelessly lost going around and around Hounslow.  I telephoned my husband in tears.  I never cry!  I had missed my slot and I was so upset.  I eventually found the site.  It was in a standalone building with lots of parking and people in high vis direc%ng you about.  There were only about 15 cars.  No queuing, I went straight to a a desk with all the admin ques%ons  then down a corridor and outside a booth.  They hadnâ€™t been very busy.  The nurse said the last person was very nervous.  I wasnâ€™t at all so he just jabbed me gave me all the informa%on.  Then I le[ waited in the car for a bit and then turned right onto the motorway home! Of course, I was so pleased with myself that I forgot to turn o. the motorway at my junc%on and my husband had to get the children from schoolâ€¦. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g P.zer, Oxford or Moderna) OAZ they only did that at that centre.  How did you feel aZer the vaccine? Did you experience any side e.ects? Ini%ally I was .ne, but I woke in the night with aches and in the morning I took a paracetamol and then that was it.  Are you sDll following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and Dmescales on restricDons ? Yes.  I am worried about my children s%ll.  There have been some cases of long covid among the teenagers around.  We really donâ€™t know all there is to know about it and I am cau%ous and quite an% social- I have been to see my sisters and broken the rules and I had a play date by accident, but generally we have been very obedient and home based.  Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you?  No, the risks are mini I am prepared to take them.  If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine Spring 2021 MARRIED MARLOW, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WIFE & MOTHER Will you accept an invitaDon to book the vaccine when it is o.ered to you? Please share your moDvaDons for your decision.   Are you hoping to receive a parDcular vaccine? (e.g P.zer, Oxford or Moderna) Will you follow the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19? (e.g social distancing, wearÂ­ing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive the vaccine. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and Dmescales on restricDons? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you?  The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). My husband had his through the Dr surgery.  I think it has been absolutely brilliant.  Hats o. to the NHS. Again.  Where do you get your informaDon about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and meÂ­dia coverage, health advice, or misinformaDon about the vaccine.   Channel 4 News, Guardian, Economist and experience from people I know who have had it.  I am so cross that some people are an% it.  They are so stupid and sel.sh.  If I were in government I would make it mandatory.  Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic.  Are there any vaccinaDons that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? Yes of course they donâ€™t want anyone unvaccinated.  It is the only way we can fully stop this virus and get back to normal.  I just think you need a really good, medical excuse not to have it.  And if you canâ€™t travel because you donâ€™t want to have it, so be it.  It is not fair on everyone else - obviously if there is a good reaÂ­son why you canâ€™t have it that is OK but these nu2y an%-vaxes are beyond me.  I have tried, but I do not understand their ra%onale.  With so many people having it they canâ€™t believe there is a signi.cant issue with it, do they really think there is a sci. reason why the government wants us to have it? Maybe I am too old to understand. .."

Identify as Queer GlasgowRetired Social Care Manager/ Writer & Life ModelSUMMER DIRECTIVE 2021COVID 19 - TESTING STORIESThe only testing I have had for Covid 19 1s Lateral Flow testing. This I have done at home by myself.I can' t remember how I got to know that the test kits were available. I think I read on the online news [I don' t watch TV news] that the Scottish government was providing kits for free.I ordered the first kit online through a government web site. It was a bit of a hassle as the site kept telling me my CHI [NHS] number was wrong and that there was no such number. Eventually I had to telephone the helpline to get them to send me the kit. It came very quickly, in fact the very next day.Doing the first test was a bit of a fiddle as the items are small especially the phials of test liquid. Swiping my tonsils was a bit uncomfortable but thrusting the stick up my nose, something I' ve heard others say they find really uncomfortable, was easy for me as I have ENT issues, so I' mused to doctors thrusting things up my nose.I remember the first time watching the indicator with bated breath and wondering what I would do if it said positive. It was negative thankfully.I filled in the online form to report the result, again with some issues due to my CHI not being recognized and received a text and an email confirming the negative test.Once my box of flow kits ran out, I went along to one of the walk-in centres where it said you could pick them up. Initially the security guard wouldn' t let me in the building without an appointment and I had to prove to him that the website says you don' t need an appointment to just pick up flow test kits. Eventually he relented.What I thought odd at the time was that rather than have the pick-up point at the front of the building, I had to walk the whole way through this labyrinth of a sports hall passing people being tested who thought they might have covid all to arrive at a table piled with free flow kits. Why the table couldn' t have been at the front door is a mystery.Since then, I have performed a flow test every Monday morning and reported the, thankfully, negative result each time.The tests give me a mental reassurance that I am keeping well, although I continue to be cautious in my interactions with others and in my safety precautions.I am registered with Test And Protect but have never been 'pinged' or anything. I'm not sure what I would do should that happen, or how I would feel. I really don' t believe the system is all that effective, although I have no actual knowledge of its working at all. I am basing that belief on a gut feeling rather than evidence. Perhaps I think that surely with the statistics, one of the people I passed on my weekly shopping in the supermarket must have become positive so why haven' t I been 'pinged' .Stupid I know but that' s what my brain is telling me.I am due to go to Barcelona at the end of September and I am more concerned about any tests I have to take to facilitate that travel. The concern though is because I have no idea what is involved and perhaps once I gain that knowledge, I will be more relaxed about it all.I think the Government should make testing compulsory for people to attend large events etc and fund research to find a quick and effective way to do immediate testing that doesn' t involve fiddling with little phials of liquid etc."

However, we didn’t travel at all between the end of October 2019 and the beginning of February 2020, so the sensation of being in one place for afew months wasn’t too strange. But now it is starting to feel claustrophobic. We also moved house in the middle of June to a town where we don’t know anyone. So now it’s very isolated feeling. We use Zoom a lot and see people that way but I really long for us to go hang out with people, somewhere. When the lockdown .rst started, we were living with four other people. So we had plenty of socialising. We had only moved into that city and house a month earlier. But we had been participating in some outside activities on various days of the week. But it hadn't really become a habit when it all ended. We stopped doing things before the government told us to stop because we were following the science. It was such a relief that people were .nally following science advice. Now, it’s the opposite. People are following government advice but not the science and it’s maddening to see people acting as if we can go back to normal. (Apart from the mask, it’s good to see nearly 100% compliance with mask wearing indoors in public places.) But it did feel eerie, in the early days, with empty streets and shut shops. And I remember going to Sainsbury’s and wanting to cry when I heard the overhead speaker say things about Covid. Just felt like living in a .lm. In March, time stood still. Then, after lockdown, it seemed like spring was over and then suddenly summer was here and it went quickly. At the moment now, it seems very, very slow. Waiting for the next Covid hit. Plus, we are planning to move house again in the next week or so, so things are strangely slow and fast. (Slow because I want it to get here, fast because I’m not ready!) Because of my personal situation of moving house and uncertainty about where, etc, I’m quite anxious and have trouble relaxing. We are trying to get back to a country where there are no commercial .ights. And we do not know if we can get a humanitarian .ight. The uncertainty is unbearable. Yet, I really want us to be out of here before things get worse, with schools/universities opening soon, ‘.u season starting soon, with Brexit. Such a strange feeling of not being allowed to go where I want to go, despite having the necessary passports. Not much has changed as we were already communicating with Zoom a lot. Early during lockdown, my daughter had a few medical appointments with a doctor via video chat for herCovid Toe. I was always shopping online already. We did participate in some church services on Sundays, which was lovely to stay in touch with some people. Generally, nothing has really changed in terms of my technology use and habits. It was strange waiting in queues at .rst. Yesterday, we had a queue outside a supermarket for the .rst time in a couple of months, which was strange again. Just feels a bit eerie. There are some people we would love to see but we are not going to because it would require public transport. It’s sad. My daughter has had Covid Toe since the end of April and it still hasn’t fully gone away. It’s so hard to understand what is going on and if it will ever go away and what it even means. It’s so frustrating that she isn’t being monitored by anyone and this isn’t being tracked. We were meant to go abroad for my grandmother’s 90th birthday party. It was going to be a huge family reunion, where I would be meeting some cousins and nieces for the .rst time. It’s so sad, so devastating that this didn’t happen. And now it will be on zoom next week and I worry that the big family reunion will not happen at all now.."

Civil Servant Summer Directive Part One 2021 My COVID 19 Tests Experience My first Lateral Flow test for COVID 19 test was just before I was due to attend a hospital appointment in January 2021. I was asked to go to the outpatients dept, where a nurse carried out the test. She was very skilled and made it feel like a simple process. It took a few days for the result to reach me, which was negative. I wasn’t unduly worried about the test results as I had been talking great care to abide by the government advice and knew that I had stuck to the rules. My next test was February 2021 after I had my first COVID jab and I felt quite ill. I have been signed up to the COVID 19 Zoe Study since April 2020 so I duly reported my symptoms on the app and was instructed to take a COVID test. I went online to book a test at my local COVID walk in test centre and found the  process very straightforward. When I got there I was surprised to find it empty except for staff, as a week or so earlier there had been long queues.  I was given the test kit and advised about what I needed to do. This experience was a lot different from the hospital one, as I lacked the nurse’s skills and I spent most of the time gagging. I managed to do the test but it was embarrassing gagging in front of the staff. Although it wasn’t a pleasant experience, I was relieved that my test came back negative and I duly reported the result on the Covid19 study app. I was anxious as I waited for the result as I couldn’t be sure if the COVID vaccine caused my symptoms or if had been unlucky and caught COVID, as I had been in contact with a number of people at the clinic where I was vaccinated, so a negative result was very reassuring. After my second COVID vaccine in April I had no symptoms so that was a relief. I received a letter from the National Statistics Office in June 2021 asking my to consider participating in the study of COVID 19 that they were running. The information was very detailed and I’m always happy to consider participating in research, so I agreed to take part. It’s pretty straightforward, initially I was required to do self administered COVID tests weekly for a month. A representative calls at my home hands me the test kit to do, after which I answer some questions, they take the test away and I receive a letter a few days later advising of the results. Now I carry out a test every month, which will be for up to a year. I have done 7 of these tests so far, all have been negative. I think that this is a good way to check that you are COVID free or if you get a positive result being able to self isolate and seek medical advice and help early and it’s helping the experts understanding of COVID. I’m not relying on the test results for assurance I don’t have COVID, if I developed symptoms I would book a test locally. The representatives are not allowed inside your home, fortunately I live in a flat so at least they are not standing out in the street. All participants are given a voucher for taking part, initially it’s for £50 and then each subsequent test £25, but I would’ve taken part anyway as I think that research is vital if illnesses are to be understood and cures or vaccines and medicines are to be developed to help keep us healthy. I find the more I do the tests the easier it becomes, especially as it’s in the privacy my own home. I don’t know much about test and trace but from what I’ve read it has its problems. Also the reliance on people to report symptoms and record their correct details can be problematic as it relies on people’s full cooperation. My grandson, who is in the forces and lives down south, received notification via the app that he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID. At this point he had just spent two weeks in his room mostly in bed, as he had become quite ill with COVID after taking part in an external training programme. During his illness and isolation period he had no contact with anybody else, even his meals were left outside his room. He did three tests after the ping alert and all were negative, but he found it very frustrating because he knew he had not seen anyone during his isolation period. It turned out his next door neighbour who had been out socialising the previous evening was the intended recipient of the alert and it had somehow been picked up on a few nearby phones too. All in all though it is trial and error, but I’m sure that it has helped prevent the spread of COVID, helped raise people’s awareness of the need to cooperate and get the vaccinations if  Covid is to be controlled and to stop even more people falling ill or dying. What I do find worrying is the item in the press yesterday 13th Sept. which reported that between mid March and the end of May this year a million people travelled into Britain and Northern Ireland from yellow card countries, of those travellers almost a third are suspected of breaking the quarantine rules. As restrictions around COVID have been relaxed and as winter approaches my biggest concern is that there is a risk that there be another peak in COVID cases. I don’t think that we can thank the NHS staff enough for the way they have all worked selflessly during this pandemic to look after COVID patients despite the risk to their own and their family’s health, such wonderful dedicated people. Also all the amazing scientists who have worked tirelessly and have successfully developed effective vaccines. I don’t understand the anti vaccination demonstrations, it’s fine to have opinions but not try to force your will on others the way some of these people have. They should hang their heads in shame at the waste of public money used to police these demonstrations, which appear to me to be an attempt to undermine all the excellent work done to try to contain and control this deadly virus. ."

I was born and educated in England. I moved to New Zealand in 2003 and live near the capital city, Wellington, with my partner of 20+ years, who is also English. I work as a Product Owner in a software development team. * * ** * ** ** ** * * * * ** ** *** * * ** * * * * * ** * * * * ** I will be lining up to get my covid-19 vaccine as soon as it is offered to me. I have no qualms about receiving a jab that has been tested to the appropriate standards as assessed by lots of countries and that has already been administered to millions around the world.  I want to have the vaccine so I can safely travel to see my family in the UK.  I also want to be part of bringing the New Zealand vaccine coverage up to a sufficient level that the New Zealand borders can be opened up again and my family can visit me. In New Zealand we are still very much at the start of our covid-19 vaccine rollout programme, and I am unlikely to be offered a vaccine until the second half of 2021.  The rollout in is 4 phases, and right now we are in phase 2.  Each phase targets a different group of people in a priority order, starting with people who are most likely to come into contact with someone who is infected.  The latest Government figures (IÂ´ve just checked them on the Ministry of Health website) are that a total of 183,351 doses have been administered, and that 42,771 people have now received their second dose. Small change compared with how many people have been vaccinated in the UK.  The Government has told us that everyone in New Zealand will be getting the Pfizer vaccine.  I believe the Government has agreements with multiple manufacturers, but the Pfizer vaccine is the only one to be approved for use here by the relevant NZ agency so far (others are going through the process). I have been reading about and listening to podcasts on the various vaccines and I am confident that any risks have a low probability which is worth the potential benefit of squashing the pandemic.  The NZ Government has started running advertisements about the vaccine, providing information to counter concerns that people might have.  Some high profile people in NZ have been vaccinated in public, or have advertised that they have had the vaccination to show that it is safe and to encourage people to have it.   There are definitely people in New Zealand who are anti the vaccine, but at the moment I think the louder concern is that the rollout is too slow and that we are lagging behind the rest of the world. *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  * * * *  *  * * * * * * Page 1 of 2 Spring 2021 G2776 Part 3: The COVID-19 Vaccine From afar the vaccine rollout in the UK looks to be a big success.  My parents, who are over 70, both received their second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine this month (April 2021) and only had positive things to say about the way it was organised and the experience of going to get their jabs.  They are still being cautious and following all the rules and guidelines about who they can meet and where and when they need to wear their masks (or at least that is what they tell me their concerned daughter overseas= but I think they are now much less worried as they go about their lives.  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  * * * *  *  * * * * * * I am slightly confused about the concern that people are expressing around having to prove you have had a vaccine in order to travel.  I have a memory of needing to have a specific jab (maybe yellow fever) in order to be able to travel in the past. I think that it is entirely reasonable for countries to put these kind of medical restrictions on entry, and it is definitely not unprecedented.  There are lots of conditions we all have to meet in order to travel abroad, I donÂ´t think having to have a vaccine or a pre-departure test is a particularly extreme requirement. I do think people have a right to be concerned about having to have vaccine passports to go about life in their own country.  Of course we have already had this kind of restriction, with the lockdowns around the world, where personal freedoms have been curtailed and very strict rules implemented to protect public health.  I think these kinds of restrictions can be justified in the short term, but I think a world where people have to show vaccine passports to enter pubs or stadiums is not one IÂ´m keen on living in.  I would hope that the long term plans for covid-19 management would not see us have to give up freedoms of movement and association in our own countries. As to the idea that any vaccine  is mandatory I donÂ´t like that idea.  I think that voluntary vaccination, available to everyone and easily accessed, is the best option.

I was born in England, where I lived until I was 30.  My partner and I moved to New Zealand in 2003.  We live just outside the capital city, Wellington.   I work for a bank as a Business Analyst.  * *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  The situation in New Zealand as I write (15  August 2020) is that we are experiencing a new outbreak of covid19 after a period of about 2 months when the virus was eliminated and the only cases were people returning from overseas who were in Government run quarantine facilities.  We have a four level alert system here, with level 4 being full lockdown and level 1 being where the virus is controlled in New Zealand, but still a risk from overseas.  Where I live we are currently at level 2, having moved four days ago after a long period at level 1.  Auckland, our biggest city, and the location of this new outbreak, is at level 3.  Level 2 rules allow for people to go to work and school, however gatherings are limited to 100 people, we are required to keep a distance of 2 metres from strangers, or wear masks where this isn´t possible, and there are some complex rules around bars and restaurants being able to operate.  My partner can open his business.  In theory I could go to the office, but my employer has instructed us to work from home until further notice.  The current alert levels are likely to be in place for at least 2 weeks.  * *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  My working routine changed significantly when we went into the original lockdown.  Back in  February I was getting up around 7am, 4 days a week to do my short train commute into Wellington.  I was working in a large office all day surrounded by colleagues.  I met friends and colleagues for lunch, or after work for drinks.  In lockdown I was working from home, at a desk in the spare room, seeing nobody but my partner except on a screen, or at a distance when out on a walk, or negotiating the supermarket aisles.  At first I was starting work earlier, but gradually I started getting up later, and being a lot more sedentary and less sociable.  Life became very, very predictable and my work days REALLY dragged.  I was eating earlier in the evening because once work finished I only had a 2 minute walk to the kitchen to start making dinner.  That meant I was sitting down to watch telly earlier and I was going to bed earlier because there wasn´t anything else to do.  Lots of activities that filled my time pre-covid, like commuting, socialising with friends, shopping, taking a trip, were curtailed.  I think that extra time was taken up mainly with watching telly, sleeping and making more phone calls to my Mum and Sister, maybe taking a walk or reading a book - on a good day.  The pace of life seemed to slow down, there was nowhere to rush to, nothing that had to be done everyday except walk the hallway to the home office and log on.  Prior to this week we were living at level 1 and a lot had returned to normal in New Zealand but I had a new work routine.  As the end of my contract approached I was given the option to apply for a permanent job, which I did, at the same time converting to full time, 37.5 hours a week.  Our offices were open again, but after surveying staff my employer chose to allow people flexibility to continue working from home.  In my team 4 out of 6 people wanted to stay working from home 100% of the time (I was one of the 2 who wanted to return to the office some of the time) - our bosses asked the team to have one coordinated day in the office a week where we could have face to face meetings, but the other days attendance was optional.  Before this very recent change of pace I was averaging 2 days a week in the office, with 3 some weeks and only 1 day in other weeks depending on my meeting schedule and out of work activities.  Initially the days back in the office were exciting - seeing people, hanging out after work, however the bright lights of the office were a bit headacheinducing and the office noise quite distracting after the silence at home.  I also found getting up and out of the house challenging and was getting into the office much later than in the pre-covid days - luckily there is a lot of flexibility around that at my workplace so it has not been an issue.   At first it was strange and a little scary to be out of the house, but as the covid cases remained in quarantine hotels and everyone stopped worrying about catching it we all got back to normal activities.  Life started to feel busy again.  You didn´t feel the need to stand far away from work colleagues when talking to them, or to sanitise your hands every 30 minutes.  The train to work filled up, although the car park at the station still looked less busy than pre-covid.  My partner and I returned to cooking quick, easy evening meals during the week whereas in lockdown there had been many fancy culinary preparations mid-week.  The lawn was went unmowed, the chilli plant withered because we forgot to water it.  The amount of clothing I was washing increased because we weren´t just wearing the same pair of trousers 3 days in a row.  It was impossible to to fit in as many phone calls to my Mum.  I started going to bed later again because I wanted to stay up to finish another episode of a show or listen to the latest episode of a favourite podcast.  There were places to go and people to see if I wanted, and a Saturday relaxing at home, doing not much, seemed like a luxury again rather than the boring norm.  This last week I had been in the office on Monday and Tuesday and was intending to be there on Thursday too, but then the announcement of changing alert levels was made on Tuesday evening and I got a text message from my boss telling me to work from home until further notice.  I felt annoyed.  I know that I am not going to enjoy having to stay at home for the next 2 weeks, or longer.  And now I realise that I was really enjoying those little bits of socialising I was doing.  Also I already miss the opportunity to get away for a weekend - my partner and I had two weekends away whilst the country was at alert level 1 - to visit different sets of family who we hadn´t been able to see since the beginning of the year.  This trips felt really energising - seeing new people, new places, feeling free to move around the country, having some news to share with people.  Being back in the uncertainty of an outbreak, puts us back to being stuck at home, nervous to go anywhere and unable to make plans whilst we watch it play out.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  When I am working from home and my partner is going to work we do get a bit out of step with each other.  I am getting up later because I only need to have logged on by 9.15 for my first meeting whereas he needs to leave the house by 8.15.  I am staying up later because I don´t have to get up so early.  As soon as I finish work around 5pm I am ready to start cooking dinner, but my partner won´t be home until 5.30 at the earliest and some evenings much later than that, so I either wait, or cook and keep it warm for him.  It means I end up doing more of the cooking, whereas when we are both going out to work and getting home at similar times we share this chore.  I think my partner thinks it is an easy life for me working from home, and so he doesn´t have much sympathy for me if I am in a bad mood after work.  But it is still work and it can be really tiring being on calls all day, with no break from the computer.  I think he thinks his job is much harder work than mine generally and especially at the moment and that if I am home I can easily do chores like cooking and cleaning.  I feel a bit resentful about this - I am still doing a full time job.  And I definitely enjoy it less without the social aspects of being around colleagues, and I think being at home makes my job more difficult to do as well.   I am also annoyed because I had only planned to do this job for 6 months after which I wanted to take some time out to go and teach English overseas, but that is obviously not a viable option right now, hence taking the permanent job.  I feel like I should be grateful that I have a well paid job and that I was given the opportunity to become a permanent employee, and I know my partner thinks I should be grateful and sit tight and stop complaining because the economy is likely to be bumpy fora  while, but the whole reason I was wanting to go overseas was that I felt like I was ready to move on from this work and now I´m right back in it with no end in sight.   This obviously doesn´t help when I am sitting alone in my office staring at a screen.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  As an English person living overseas I was already using technology to keep in touch with family and friends, so covid didn´t change that for me, just increased how often I was using it and the number of people I was communicating with.  We haven´t done online grocery shopping at all, but I have ordered a few things online that I might have gone to the shops for if it weren´t for covid or lockdown.  Online shopping isn´t a new thing for me, but I have been using it for buying different types of things.  For example we ordered DIY supplies online for collection, during the alert level 3 phase of the original lockdown.  And takeaway meals, which usually we would go and order in the restaurant in person.   Most recently I have ordered some face masks online, not something I would have been doing online or otherwise pre-covid.  I had my first remote doctor´s appointment last month.  During lockdown my GP started doing consultations on the phone, and even though doctors can see patients face to face now they are still offering phone appointments if patients prefer.  In my case I woke up in a lot of pain with what I suspected was a kidney stone (had one before), I wasn´t really able to drive myself anywhere or sit in a waiting room chair (what they say about kidney stones being really painful is true), so the doctor called me, and asked questions about my pain, and then sent a prescription for pain medication to the pharmacy so that it was there when someone could pick it up for me.  It was way easier than having to get myself to the surgery.  She did tell me to come to the surgery once I was feeling a bit better so we could talk about follow up tests...so I guess things aren´t changing that radically in the long run.  In New Zealand the Government has created a mobile phone app that they want us all to use.  It scans QR codes that businesses display at their premises so you can keep a record of everywhere you have been to help with track and trace if you test positive for covid or if someone else who is positive was at the same location as you.  I downloaded the app early on, but didn´t use it that much because not all places had QR codes displayed, and then as the number of cases dwindled it was a bit of a pain to remember to scan when you are rushing into somewhere doing life back at normal pace again.  To do my duty as part of the ´team of 5 million´ ( the Prime Minister´s description of the NZ population during covid) I have been keeping a written note on a calendar of where I have gone and who I have seen. I started back in April, just noting down which supermarket I went to at first, then later what days I was in the office and if I went to my dance class or met a friend for lunch, or popped into a shop, or picked up a book from the library.  This week displaying the QR codes became compulsory for businesses, so I have abandoned my calendar and am trying to use the app now.  Its much easier remembering to scan and keep records when the threat of the virus is on your mind and you aren´t going to many places, so I expect I will be good at using the app whilst we are in level 2 but not so good once we (hopefully) get back to level 1 life.  My Mum, who lives alone back in the UK, has been keeping a record of phone calls made and received during lockdown.  She got the idea from a friend who was having trouble keeping track of which people she had talked to and didn´t want to forget some people or call other people up again when there were was nothing new to say.    * *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *  Since March, when the alert levels were announced and we moved into lockdown in New Zealand, I have had the experience of time passing very slowly on a micro level, but very fast at the macro level, by which I mean, my days have dragged, but the months since the start of the year feel like they have flown by.  It seems unbelievable that we are over half way through the year already, that period has gone by in the blink of an eye, but at the same time January feels a really long time ago when the world was a different place.  Whilst on a day to day basis I do things, there are few significant events to punctuate my routine, which feels very dull and staid.  My life feels like it has shrunk.  It is difficult to make plans beyond the next few days and this has made me feel completely unmotivated to make any plans at all.  Life definitely feels like it is on a kind of pause, waiting for covid to be over, and it is becoming more and more apparent that won´t happen for months or maybe even years.    With this new outbreak I feel like I have regressed back to feeling the kind of anxiety I had at the beginning of the covid outbreak, but this time I have fast forwarded through the adrenalin fuelled `Let´s make the best of it´ phase straight to apathy and dejection.  This is not helped by the fact we are in Winter now as opposed to early Autumn the first time around.  Many things I thought would be happening this year have not, and most likely will not, happen - like going overseas to teach, or even taking a Winter break overseas.  I try not to think too hard about when I might get to return to the UK to see my parents, it is a very difficult thing to think about.  I made the choice to come to New Zealand just before I turned 30, an adventure more than a permanent move.  Now, over 17 years later, New Zealand is my home, my life is here and I am happy being here.  However I have more recently faced the reality that my choice to be here means that there are only a limited number of times I will see my parents in person again, limited by the number of trips I make back and how long they have to live.  My parents are in their 70´s and two years ago my Dad was diagnosed with cancer (of the kidney, removed and so far not returned - yep, our family and kidneys hey - my paternal Grandfather had kidney cancer too), but I thought I could go back every year, there were still enough visits left.  Now who knows?  Whilst it is possible for me to wave my British passport in the air and get back to England anytime, when it will become a practical, affordable and safe option for me is unknown.  I don´t acknowledge it to parents, but this makes me feel awful, and leads me to question my decision to move here more than I have ever done before.    * *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * *  *  *  *  * *"

Age: 65; Occupation: Retired teacher Part 3: The COVID-19 Vaccine As a volunteer at the local hospice, I was encouraged to have the vaccine and therefore able to access my first vaccination early in the programme. I was able to drive to a nearby hospital and lined up with other NHS staff and volunteers for my Pfizer jab. I travelled with my wife by car the 10 miles to the local hospital and feel the process was calm, measured and well organised throughout. Everyone involved seemed to understand the likely benefits of the vaccine and were wanting to play their part in enabling their places of work to become safer for patients and families. People were polite and courteous, and time spent in the vaccination centre was kept to a minimum. I spoke to a couple of staff members who had been redeployed from other roles (for example, a local prison) and my impression was that both givers and receivers of the vaccine were pleased to be involved in the programme. This was not a surprise as some were frontline workers and doubtless relieved to be amongst the first to be vaccinated and able to feel a little safer as they went about their work. I had no side effects after either of my jabs save for a little soreness in the shoulder for a day or two. I was aware of the potential side effects of the vaccine and that time spent on producing it had been accelerated. However, the argument of the â€˜greater goodâ€™ is powerful one. I have tried to observe the guidelines throughout the entire pandemic, with, I think, only minor deviations, and am broadly happy with the timeline on how the lockdown measures are due to ease in coming weeks. I understand the concerns raised by those significantly affected by the lockdown but feel that the situation is complex and therefore difficult to get right for everyone. That said, there seem to have been situations in which government action has been too slow; the most recent being a sluggish decision on shutting down travel from India which has seen new variants emerge, together with a spike in cases. The vaccine programme The vaccine programme in our locality has been delivered via hospitals, certain GP surgeries and through hubs created to provide a mass-vaccination provision. My impression is that the system of working through the population based on age and priority groups has been appropriate and understood by most people. One might debate some of the policies and practices of the government in recent months but there is universal praise for almost all aspects of the vaccination programme. As someone who engages little with social media, I have sought to access advice and information from three main sources. The NHS, the BBC, and The Times newspaper. Of real concern is the way in which misinformation has been allowed to spread though certain media platforms and this is a real challenge for the immediate future and beyond. More needs to be done to regulate platforms which make available inaccurate information or perpetuate urban myths about treatments and vaccinations linked to Covid, as well as wide range of other issues. Making vaccines mandatory The debate about compulsory â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ in the wake of the pandemic was inevitable; it is also complex and nuanced. As an advocate of vaccinations for all infectious diseases for the overall benefit of the population I fall short of making them compulsory, although I would understand if certain job groups did move to make them so. For example, I have an ageing and increasingly frail mum; should she have to move into a nursing home I would want the staff to be vaccinated to help keep her safe. I have travelled a little in Africa. For some countries I was required to have a vaccination for Yellow Fever; without the certificate confirming I had received the vaccination I would not have been able to go there. The culture of the UK has traditionally been one to resist making vaccinations mandatory, but to encourage uptake through education and opportunity. The education programme for Covid-19 vaccinations needs to be exceptionally good indeed! Working as a volunteer at a Vaccination hub I am currently working as a volunteer at a vaccination hub a little distance from where I live. I have been driving there two or three times a week for a couple of months to help as a volunteer marshal. When I arrive, I don a green tabard on which is written â€™Here to Helpâ€™ and then position myself in one of six locations to meet and greet people arriving for their vaccinations. People arriving are invariably pleased to be receiving their jab, often thank me for volunteering my time and are speedily through the one-way system and on their way home or back to work. NHS staff are friendly, and a number have told me that they have returned to work having retired or moved on to other roles. Although the tasks undertaken are a little mundane there is a real sense of community spirit and a desire for everyone to play their part in moving the country out of this difficult period. I am pleased to play a very small part in this historical effort."

When I imagine ‘a healthy body’ the image in my mind immediately springs to someone in their twenties, when we are usually at the peak of our physical best and still possessing an enthusiastic and positive outlook on life. There is no particular person that comes to mind, anyone in this age group that is active and not suffering from any illness or conditions. I would think of myself when I was at that age, or someone who is presented in the media as ‘typical’: a sportsperson or anyone you might see in an advert; a character on TV or film. This is not bounded necessarily by age, gender, ethnicity or anything else, it is who is usually selected as ‘ideal’ to represent the hero, or suitable to promote a product. Five words: youth, slenderness, smile, tone, good teeth. Identity I don’t think that my health and wellbeing is influenced much by my gender, ethnicity, social class or sexual orientation. That may be due to my being white, male and middle class and, as long as you look after yourself, there isn’t a lot going against that privileged position. Perhaps the only thing I can think of is the expectations I have felt placed upon me as a man. I am not very sporty, and I am of a very slender build with no upper body strength. I simply don’t have a muscular chest, arms or legs! They are naturally quite reedy. When I was younger it used to bother me a somewhat. I felt I ought to be more muscular and even tried weights for a while, but I soon realised I had no muscle to grow and develop. I also felt as a man I should be into sports. I am not. Watching or participating in any of them bores me. I soon decided I was what I was and learned to love my body and embrace my nerdiness. However, I do not consider myself unhealthy. I have certainly never been sickly, which is a blessing. Up until my young teens I joined my parents each weekend on countryside rambles and fell walking, climbing Scafell Pike, Snowdon and Ben Nevis by the time I was 14. Before owning a car, I cycled everywhere and continued to do so often. I have treated it as a means to get around rather than exercise in itself and will still cycle on errands when practicable. Only in recent years have I begun forcing myself to go out on my bike as simple exercise, maybe going 10 miles once a week or so. I consider the cardio-vascular side of this exercise to be most valuable, and as I get older it is of increasing importance. My father died of a heart attack, so it is this aspect of my health that gets my attention. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I cannot recall exactly where and when I became aware of health and wellbeing. Certainly, awareness of health seeped into me from a young age from a variety of sources, but mostly my parents. As a child I was always taught to brush my teeth, have a piece of fruit a day, wash regularly. It was talked about in school, in youth organisations like cubs and scouts that I was part of. It was something you would hear on TV and in magazines. It was generally assumed and promoted, not in an overt way, but it was around in many places. It wasn’t something that I recall being aggressively talked about, promoted or fretted about. Being physically healthy was just something you were, rather than went out of your way to be. I remember my mother walking everywhere; she did not drive. She would walk to the shops, and we thought nothing of walking 2 miles to go to a large park where there was an adventure playground. It was perhaps symptomatic of my parent’s generation. They were both born in 1929 and didn’t own a car until the mid-1960’s, so I inherited their mindset of an age where people supposedly had healthier lives by necessity. Health-consciousness, and after it, well-being, were things that I remember growing in importance. I can recall when jogging was a new craze that came over from the USA. It felt to me that health began to shift from something that you possessed to something that you had to actively ‘add-on’. I don’t recall any great ‘sit-down-and-listen’ conversations from my parents about health, nor from school. For me it is something that is always in the background, talked about, known about, perhaps assumed. Well-being, as I interpret it being more about the mind, is something that has emerged later, to the extent we now see royals and celebrities actively talking about mental health. Key Moments My first awareness of bodily changes associated with puberty were probably getting erections at all sorts of times and places, not always ‘convenient’. I recall being sat in class at school and, unprompted, up one popped leaving me trying to hide it under my desk. I remember having my first wet dream also, but I had read somewhere about that sort of thing happening so although I woke up a little surprised, I soon realised what had happened. I think for girls these moments are more significant. They are less easy to hide, I guess. A first period is going to be messy and doesn’t just go away after time like an erection, it needs cleaning up. Similarly buying a first bra is likely something to be done with a parent, so it doesn’t happen in secret. I don’t recall my voice breaking, or anyone else’s for that matter. When it became obvious that my chin was starting to look a little hairy, I first used my dad’s electric shaver. I remember it feeling like a layer of skin had been scraped off and it was sore for a while. Once I was doing this regularly it began to firm up and my dad went out and bought me my own shaver. I don’t think I had any great feelings either way about these events. It was no big deal, just part of growing up. Having an older brother and sister I think I was impatient to grow up and be able to do all the things they were doing that I was missing out on. I had read about these changes that were to come to my body. I think my mum had got me a couple of books from the library rather than having a sit-down talk about the ‘facts of life’ and that was fine by me. Growing Older I have always cycled to actively maintain my physical health. I cycled 3 miles to school and back for the whole of my secondary education. At Polytechnic it was my only means of getting around and there I would travel 4 miles from digs each day, or up to 10 miles to other student’s houses. My hobby is aviation, so I have often cycled from home to airports and airfields where I have lived similar distances from them. I cycled to and from work for a couple of years when I was near enough at one location, and I have always used my bicycle to do quick shopping trips or run errands like going to the post office, rather than use the car. Later in life, with having children and endlessly running them around in the car to activities I have cycled less. I am pleased to say they either walked or cycled to their schools right up to sixth form. It is only in recent years that I have begin to go out cycling just for that exercise in itself. With not doing it as regularly as I did when I was young, I can feel myself getting out of shape. I walk our dog each day and make myself do half or an hour’s cycling once a week. I am hoping to retire this year and with the extra time I shall endeavour to cycle more regularly. I want to keep a reasonable level of fitness and there aren’t any others that appeal to me. I enjoy covering distance, seeing the area I cycle round, and if there is an aim to it, be it an errand or airport, all the better. I am aware of my father’s demise from heart failure at the relatively young age of 70 and that drives me to look after my own in this way. As I get older maintaining my level of fitness, not at a sporting level, but at a comfortably able level is becoming more important. I would like to get back into countryside walking, I think. Unfortunately, my wife endures rheumatoid and osteoarthritis so walking any distance isn’t a feature of our lives together. I am very fortunate not to have suffered mental health problems, but I am very well aware that exercise is good for that. There have been many traumatic episodes in my family’s life and they have had their toll on my wife and daughter particularly. My emotional health has been impacted and I think it is important to differentiate between that and mental health. It may be just semantics, but I don’t think mental health and emotional health are the same thing. Looking after my family (at one time I was on suicide watch with my wife) was a great strain. When I spoke about it to my work manager, needing support, they could only think it terms of mental health. Was I depressed? No, I was just overwhelmed with stress, worry and anxiety. It was my emotions that were going through the shredder, not my ability to function mentally. I believe making a distinction between the two would encourage more men to talk about their feelings. Mental health still has a stigma attached despite all the progress in recent years. Depression is more often a clinical matter. Sometimes circumstances can lead to depression, but also there is the grey area of emotional health that shouldn’t be treated with medication, a shallower but similarly hampering state. Physical exercise certainly helped, but I found the wellbeing of my mind was aided by talking to friends, contemplation and just going out and doing things I enjoyed. There’s nothing better than talking to a good friend about your troubles, especially one who knows you well, is a good listener and knows your circumstances and where you are coming from. I have talked to a counsellor and it is a frustrating experience having to go over the details of everything that has happened so they can gain and understanding of what you are going through. Sometimes you just need someone to sit alongside you in silence and a good friend who can do that is all you need. Contemplation is immensely helpful too. I am a Christian (whatever that means, I’m still a work in progress), read the Bible and pray, following Jesus. In recent years I have come to understand the contemplative, reflective side of my faith. Prayer is less about asking for something to be done but identifying with others and framing yourself alongside them. It helps to put everything into context. You realise and accept that at many times in life order is broken down into disorder, then rebuilt or re-created anew, frequently for the better or stronger. It is a deep principle that you see reflected in a lot of counselling and wellbeing thought. Letting go and accepting sometimes is a powerful principle. I look back and see what my family has been through and we have all weathered a remarkable storm, and I believe our wellbeing is in part through our prayers, the prayers of other and the faithfulness of God. Sometimes it’s good just to go and do something you enjoy. Physical exercise plays a part in that, but I am just as happy and get just as much refreshment from mental stimulus. Walking my dog, listening to music, or walking my dog whilst listening to music are welcome breaks from the day’s routine or pressures. Best of all is a day out in my car driving to an airport like Heathrow to watch and photograph the planes. My mind is focussed on nothing but the task of photography, lighting conditions, being outdoors, checking the schedules and watching what is going on. When done with like-minded friends all the better. It is the all-consuming distraction that a busy mind needs to take your focus off things that cause worry, and I always feel better for a day out like that. As I get older I expect I shall be paying more attention to my physical health as already I can feel things creaking and bits starting to fall off. Unlike my father I don’t smoke, don’t drink nearly as much as he did, and I have been a vegetarian since my late teens. That choice was more on ethical reasons than health benefits, but it does no harm and must be healthier for me. I was positively dissuaded from smoking. We were all becoming aware of the health risks of that in the 1970’s and the tide had turned against acceptance of that as the norm. I am pleased to say I have never been tempted. Despite that he was a regular rambler all his life so I am mindful that I can’t neglect physical exercise. I can see myself needing to become more careful in the future. I have been blessed with good health all my life. I have never broken a bone, and only been in hospital once for a kidney stone. Apart from the occasional heavy cold (flu?) and succumbing to gastro-enteritis now and then, that’s been it. I know statistically something will crop up sooner or later. There’s not a lot I can do about that other than what I do now, so it is to be expected. I can feel myself being a little clumsier around the house. Slowing down and being more measured is something I am mindful I need to be so that I don’t trip over my slippers or the dog. I can feel perhaps the beginnings of arthritis in joints and I know how longer fractures take to heal as you get older. Basically, I don’t like hospitals and am a coward when it comes to pain so I intend to avoid both of those if I can! Cycling is perhaps the only worry here. Roads don’t get any quieter and I know my wife is concerned every time I go out. I am careful but there is no guarantee. Maybe I shall have to join her swimming. I did regularly swim for a few months while I was doing some intense training for my job. I was in temporary digs near a sports centre so each day I would go and swim lengths for half an hour or so. It was a bit boring to be honest, but I did need to stimulus of stretching and exercising to help me unwind. Health, wellbeing and appearance External appearance can be totally unrelated to what’s going on underneath. Many conditions are completely hidden, but I would generally say that weight is the first and main thing that relates to good health and wellbeing. Overweight people simply don’t look healthy in my opinion. Is there a direct correlation to size and physical health? There has to be a broad one, but in the case of my wife it is not quite so straightforward. She carries more weight than she should for her height and I put that down to her reduced mobility due to arthritis. However, she swims for at least 40 minutes most days and can cover a couple of miles when sea swimming. Her heart and lungs are probably in pretty good condition. I can’t help noticing smokers though. The yellowy-grey skin and hair. It doesn’t look a picture of health at all. I know some people who are physically very fit but sometimes you can see they are wracked with the pain of mental health, etched on their faces. I don’t think I have ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. I’m never going to grace the cover of GQ so why worry? My ideal woman was never the stick-thin pouty model-type if that is the popular choice. We all have our own likes and preferences and it sometimes surprises me by what someone sees in someone else. However, it is the person inside that counts most. I know many beautiful people of all shapes and sizes and I find that to be truer each day as I am heading towards celebrating my silver wedding anniversary. Our health and appearance may be in decline but that inner beauty becomes more and more apparent and important. I don’t think my parents were particularly influenced by these ideals. They were quite ordinary in appearance. Comfort was the main factor; their exercise was one for enjoyment rather than as a means to itself. I can’t think of any health or beauty products that I couldn’t live without. A quick squirt of deodorant under the armpits and I’m done. In the winter I always carry a lip salve in my pocket. Does brushing my teeth count as a health product? After half my mouth was filled with amalgam by the time I was 14 I decided I didn’t want any more of that and made sure I brushed regularly from then on. No fillings since! My desert Island item would be sunblock, of course. Getting ready to leave the house My father would use his electric shaver and splash on some Brut on his chin before going to work and that was it. I don’t recall my mother ever wearing make-up. Maybe some lipstick for a (rare) night out or for a wedding. She wasn’t one for eyeshadow or blusher, but for special occasions would always like to get her hair done nicely. My routine is much the same as described above. I pay only scant attention to my appearance other than looking neat and tidy. My hair and face are very low maintenance. I don’t even use after shave lotion. Wearing decent and comfortable clothes is more important, as is looking smart for special occasions where I go so far as to add a spray of scent. This hasn’t changed over time. I was never fussy as a teenager and only when I got into serious dating did I begin to use cologne."

Mass-Observer D4736 describes themself as male; age 54; married; air traffic control assistant.;The Directive 'COVID-19 and Time' was issued on 7 August 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in relation to the 'rhythm and routine of the day'; 'homelife'; use of 'media and technology'; their experiences of 'waiting'.,"D4736     Male, 54, Married, Southampton, Air Traffic Control Assistant  Part 1: Covid-19 and Time  Rhythm and routine of the day I wouldn’t say lockdown has significantly disrupted my daily life and routines.  I have always worked an irregular pattern of shifts so I am used to being at home on any day of the week and at work on many weekends. I am nearly always home for most of the morning or most of the afternoon when working. My wife is medically retired and suffers from life-limiting arthritis so we are quite used to being at home together. With two adult children now at university and planned early retirement coming up for me within the next year, the lockdown hasn’t felt like it has had any significant impact in that way. If anything, it feels like a rehearsal for retirement. My job was immediately deemed essential (I work in an operational position with airline flight plans supporting radar controllers, airport tower controllers and airline operators with flight data – a sort of help desk if you will) so I was still going into work. However, with air traffic reducing by 90%, I was often on standby at home as we didn’t require as many staff to be in. There have been redundancies announced for non-operational staff, but we are retained as there is no way of knowing at this stage by how much air travel will recover. Both of my children elected to stay away at their respective universities so the routine of our daily life remained more or less unchanged by lockdown. I have got used to being at home with just my wife this past year, and we have enjoyed pottering around the home with less responsibilities, and time to go about our own hobbies and projects. The only routines and habits that changed during lockdown were with complying with restrictions. I was still going to work, doing the shopping and walking the dog each day. At first I was quite anxious as my wife was in the higher risk category because she takes immune-suppressant medication. I was taking all precautions and being fastidious about hygiene, but once I had settled into that regimen and found that I could still function, it became less worrisome. As each week went on, as each shopping trip and work day completed with no symptoms showing, I began to feel more confident at ‘living’ with Coronavirus. From this place of privilege it was possible to enjoy the extraordinary circumstances of our country in lockdown. The remarkable clear weather and silence that descended across our land were truly wonderful. It seemed wrong to not at least experience this, if enjoyment is perhaps the wrong word given the awful circumstances unfolding in hospitals and care homes. Driving to and from work or the shops was an unusual pleasure. Traffic free roads and motorways was a novel experience. Walking my dog around the locality was joyous in the din of birdsong and pleasantries exchanged with fellow exercisers. Acknowledging each other existence as if to say: ‘still alive!’ and be grateful for taking wide berths around each other.  Time certainly slowed down here. Being unable to be busy doing the usual things, going out, meeting people, my focus became about the things going on at home. More time spent sitting in the garden enjoying the peace and quiet, so certainly I was more aware of the weather, the growth of flowers in the garden and the emerging leaves on the trees behind us. One aspect of time that has come to mind is how everything before Covid seems so long ago. I was very fortunate to holiday in the Caribbean in January, landing back at Heathrow on February 1st, just as talk of a pandemic was beginning to appear in the news. Several times over the last few months it has struck me that I find it hard to believe that I had been away on holiday this year. Everything we did, the way we used to live without concerns feels so long ago, a world away. As lockdown restrictions are eased rhythms are changing but the routine of taking precautions has not changed for me. I have noticed other people being lax about distancing, wearing face coverings and so on. These are habits I have now ingrained in me that I am going to find it hard to relinquish until such a time as we are Covid free, if ever. Going out with a face covering and taking hand gel has become as habitual as picking up my keys, phone and glasses. I am uncomfortable with other people, particularly work colleagues, when they come close to speak to me or when work needs to be looked at. I am going to find it hard, and it will feel strange to relax this, to start shaking hands with people again.  Homelife For me my homelife changed very little under lockdown. I wasn’t furloughed or able to work from home, so it was very much routine as usual for my wife and I. We are used to being here together, and as this is the first year without any children at home we have been enjoying that space and each others company. Therefore we have been very ‘in-synch’ with each other and I don’t anticipate much changing in the future.  Media and technology I haven’t made any drastic changes to my use of technology and media. Generally I have used the same methods to communicate with my family as before. With my two children it has been through text, messenger and video calls on a computer or phone. With my older relatives it has been via email or telephone, the usual channels as before. I don’t think they have the ability or inclination to acquire mobile phones or new computers that have cameras built it, so those ways suffice. Why change? I have had to incorporate a few new computer programs when these have been imposed on me or requested. At work I use computers that are connected solely to the air traffic system. For briefings, emails, roster information etc… we use shared ‘hot desks’ which of course were immediately placed out of bounds. I had to arrange remote access on my home computer which came with a set of hard-to-follow instructions. It involved having access tokens sent by text to my mobile phone, scanning an on-screen Q-code, and various other security hoops to jump through. In the end I phoned the helpdesk who lived up to their name and I was soon able to log-in to everything I needed. A bit of a pain to have to do but once set up it’s been fine. I’m a member of a group from a church that met weekly in each other homes. ‘Bible study’ group would sound a bit formal and stiff but we do chat about our Christian lives, support each other practically, in prayer and just by being together over a slice of cake and cup of tea. Of course we had to stop doing that so we all became quickly familiar with Zoom, as did most of the country it seems. If only I’d bought shares in that, Perspex, face masks and alcohol gel. We began by using one of our folks’ work account, then the church got its own as everyone started using it. For the large part it works well, and it’s a good way of keeping in touch with people, particularly helpful at the beginning of lockdown when things were quite anxious. We soon got up to speed with the etiquette and pitfalls of all speaking at once, and the varying levels of connectivity on routers and devices with faces dropping out and re-appearing from time to time. It has been very useful, although one or two have struggled. One of our oldest friends finds it an extra burden to get his head around and isn’t keen on the hassle it brings to him. Another is on Zoom meetings all day at work from home so to have another in the evening is one more too many. Begs the question whether people will embrace working from home full-time? It seems to be quite wearing to do for any length of time so maybe they will soon tire of it and return to the face to face interactions of the office. I think it will be a mixture of the two. Some days at home and some in the office. Having got used to meetings like this I can see me continuing to do so in the future. Already I have had one with my pension broker, and my daughter had an online consultation with a doctor. It does save a lot of time and effort if matters are relatively straightforward, if reviewing or exchanging information. I did have one Microsoft Teams meeting I was supposed to attend with work, but despite clicking on the link provided when using home access I got a ‘Trying to locate teams…’ and the spinning wheel of death for 45 minutes. Inevitably these glitches will occur.  Waiting Because I have continued going in to work, and the dynamics of home life has remained pretty much the same, I do not feel life has been put on hold. Of course there are things that have stopped – going out to pubs and restaurants, visiting National Trust properties and gardens, concerts and foreign holiday plans. All these things are paused and I certainly haven’t been at the front of the queue to engage in any of them. I imagine I will drift back into pubs and restaurants at some time as long as the rate of infections remains low. Already I have used outdoor kiosks at the beach, which is not much different to shopping. We are meeting friends next weekend but I don’t think we will use a restaurant or pub. I’m suggesting we each bring a picnic and meet outdoors somewhere if the weather co-operates.  I have a concert ticket in about a months’ time, rescheduled from March this year. At present it hasn’t been decided if indoor events like this will resume. If an announcement is made in the next couple of weeks I think I will still be wary of going. I’m hoping it will be cancelled or postponed again, I’m really not sure when I’ll be ready to do that again. Similarly I have no desire to get on an aeroplane any time soon either. Apart from the risks of enclosed spaces, there is such uncertainty and rapid changes in quarantine restrictions I wouldn’t want to be subject to those disruptions.  All of these things are an inconvenience to not be able to do. Holidays and concerts really are a luxury and I’m slightly aghast when people say they are ‘devastated’ if something like this is cancelled. That really is the wrong use of the word and insulting to those that have lost their jobs, careers, livelihoods, loved ones or experienced some other disaster. I’ve already begun to have misgivings about the amount of flying I have done when you look at the ongoing climate emergency. We really can live without a lot of the fancy things we do. It’s nice, but not essential, so even if there is a year or two when I can’t do these things it’ll be alright. Maybe I can say that as I approach retirement. I have had many experiences in my life. Perhaps if this happened when I was much younger I would have felt keenly the loss of opportunities. With shopping I have been fortunate not to have had to queue too much. There are three supermarkets nearby which I can use. One is a giant aircraft-hangar sized ASDA which I try to avoid at the best of times, and as there were queues around the entire car park I didn’t miss it. I usually use a small four-aisled Co-op and benefit greatly from the snobbery of the Waitrose shoppers across the road from it. There they have been queuing, whereas my little Co-op has been its usual quiet self, much to my convenience. If I have needed to go to the others I’ve always managed to get there earlier in the morning and not experienced much delay. I’d was happier being in there with as few other people around as possible. On the whole I have found any time queuing, standing back or waiting for people in narrow  supermarket aisles to have been good natured and appreciated by all sides. Just occasionally people have pushed past rather closely (staff included!) and that has been most annoying. You just have to let it slip and adjust to a different pace of life.  I am very grateful that no one in my immediate family has been affected by any Covid-related illness. We have all been careful, and I dare say fortunate, to have come this far all safe and well."

However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine.Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes.If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccinePlease describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre?I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 23rd December 2020. I went to the Melbourne Road Health centre for it. It was given by an NHS staff member, presumably a nurse. The whole place was filled with people and very busy. I took a bus for part of the journey to the centre and walked the rest. I received my second vaccination on 26th February 2021 at the same health centre It was not very far from where I live but was not easy to get to, there being no direct bus service. I used the journey to and from the centre as an opportunity to get some exercise and be outdoors.Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna)I received the Pfizer vaccination on both occasions.How did you feel after the vaccine?Normal. Relieved that I had completed both vaccinations. I felt that some of the pressure was off. I continued to observe social distancing and wore face protection when necessary.Did you experience any side effects?Only some red spots on my legs that I thought might have been a side effect but cannot be certain of that. Otherwise, the only other side effect was an ache in the arm that lasted for no more than three days.Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)?I wore a mask or shield whenever I went shopping. In fact, I now wear a transparent face shield because I have to wear spectacles and, in cold weather, these will always fog up if I wear a mask. I put on a mask if I have a visitor at home, such as a worker or my landlady. I observe social distancing in public places. I have stayed at home a lot during the lockdown but this has been due to there not being anywhere to go. Pubs are closed. Music concerts have all been cancelled. Theatres are not open. The things I used to do before the lockdown have all ceased. I have continued to go shopping in the supermarkets in the city centre, mainlyL6048, male, 71, Leicester, retiredbecause I need to get out of the house. Whilst I have had some home deliveries of food, I prefer to go to the supermarket to get supplies. I do not have any relatives living in the town where I live so I have not had anyone to visit. I have visited a few friends during the lockdown but we have nearly always sat in the garden. Only a few of the people I know have said they have been infected. No one I know has died of the virus. I am a member of a bubble comprised of neighbours who live in the same apartment block. I have met others in my bubble indoors in our own homes. During those social meetings we have not worn masks. Arriving home from such meetings, I washed my hands. Now I have been vaccinated, I wash my hands less frequently but I do many episodes of washing up during the day and that keeps my hands clean. If I am visited by someone who is not in my bubble, I wear a mask.What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ?The city where I live has been subject to lockdown for longer than any other place in the country. At the time of writing (18th April 2021), lockdown restrictions are being eased gradually. The government is trying to lift the restrictions slowly. This might work but there could yet be a third wave although it will be smaller than the first two because of the extent of vaccinations. Young people have shown themselves to be irresponsible and careless about observing the restrictions. In nearby cities, such as Nottingham, large house parties have been broken up by the police and the organisers given hefty fines. Justifiably, in my opinion. The infection rates in my city have been higher than the national average for most of the pandemic; my home city has a large BAME population. In my opinion, the government have reacted to the pandemic too late and too slowly. Much more could have been done to prevent people entering England from infected areas. There has been an over-reliance on testing and insufficient monitoring of those tested positive. People have been asked to self-isolate but the government has not put procedures in place to verify they are doing this. Having certain underlying health conditions, I have had to self-isolate more than most healthy people. I have been happy to comply.Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you?No. Concerns about the vaccines causing blood clots are almost certainly unfounded and are rumours fanned by the media based on a misunderstanding of the medical research data. There is no proof, to date, that there is any direct connection between the vaccines and the occurrence of medical conditions such as blood clotting. Most of the worries about the vaccines have been groundless, based on misunderstandings and fake news in social media.If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccineWill you accept an invitation to book the vaccine when it is offered to you? Please share your motivations for your decision.It might be that booster jabs will be offered in the autumn. I will be happy to accept if invited to have one. It will be a very long time (if ever) before the coronavirus is eliminated in this country and will be present in the rest of the world for many years to come. It is my duty to protect others from the spread of the virus. I see public health as being both the responsibility of each and every individual and the government.Are you hoping to receive a particular vaccine? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Medema)I was happy to accept whatever vaccine was offered to me. At the time of my first jab, I had no issues with the type of vaccine that would be administered. I was happy to accept whatever they chose to give me. Prior to attending the vaccination centre, I did not know which vaccine I would be given.Will you follow the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19? (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive thevaccine.I complied with the restrictions imposed by the government at all times throughout the pandemic. I will continue to observe social distancing, wearing a mask and washing my hands until the government declares that the epidemic, in this country, is over.What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions?The Government made errors of judgement last year in lifting some of the restrictions too early. The current easing of restrictions appears to be going more cautiously and might allow the country to remove the last of the restrictions later this year. The gradual easing of restrictions will work if the general public remain cautious and continue to observe sensible precautions Mass spectator sports and entertainment events are being allowed, on a limited and controlled basis, so that scientific studies can be made to see if these spread infections. It is important that we collect data about infections in samples of non-infected persons.Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you?Generally, I have seen no scientific evidence of any of the vaccines not being safe. What worries me is that there are people who spread fake news and misinformation about the vaccines and what they do. Social media companies are not doing enough to prevent this from happening.The vaccine programmeHow is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme (e.g. priority groups, plans to vaccinate key workers).From the start of its availability, the vaccines have been administered according to age, with the oldest people being offered it first. Jabs are now being offered to people in their forties. I felt, at the time, that prioritising by age was justified. The latest development is that women who are pregnant are being advised that it is safe for them to be vaccinated. In my view, all workers in the care sector should have been vaccinated as soon as the vaccines became available. Far too many residents in nursing homes and homes for elderly people died because staff working there were not given priority. There is now a controversy about vaccination passports. In particular, there 1s an argument about whether or not proof of vaccination should be required when going to pubs and restaurants. I understand concerns about freedom and civil liberties. We have had to get used to not being able to smoke tobacco in public places This has worked since the smoking ban was introduced. Being in close proximity with other people poses the risk of spreading infections of any kind. A lot of people carry viruses without knowing it. That is why colds and influenza spread. Of course, there are some people who have colds and flu symptoms but go to work or places of entertainment anyway. That is irresponsible but there will always be some who feel obliged to work even when they are not well. I am sure I have gone to packed concerts when I know I have a cold. Venues have not been legally obliged to ensure they are offering a healthy environment to their clientele, other than the usual health and safety precautions. I think this will change and pubs and music venues will have to ensure they are adequately ventilated. It is very difficult to check that everyone has had a recent COVID test with a negative result. In some cases, test results can be forged. It should be a condition of gaining employment that workers should provide valid statements that they are COVID-free. Going to work whilst carrying a virus should be avoided. This might infringe the rights of workers but it also helps to confirm the rights of others to be free of disease.Where do you get your information about the vaccine?Mainly from the television news and from reliable internet websites. Very little came in from the local authority or from my GP practice. When news is reported about the vaccines on offer, I pay attention. I have oftenwatched the press briefings broadcast from Downing Street. I pay close attention to all aspects of pandemic and the methods used to counter it.Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.Media coverage gave attention to the impact on ethnic minority people of the COVID epidemic. This was biased towards showing that the infection was unequally distributed by race. Too little attention was given to why this should have been so. Even the government-back enquiries into the impact of the disease on the BAME communities, failed to really discover why some communities had high rates of infection. In my local town there are large number of BAME people in the population. I have observed them when they gather in public places, including parks and in the streets. I have often seen such people ignoring social distancing requirements. Young people are particularly prone to this. Either members of the BAME communities have failed to get the message about preventing infection or their culture is such that it works against them keeping their distance from each other. I have seen groups of Asian people gathering together in close proximity although such sightings have largely been outdoors. There has been recent media coverage concerning the disease and black people. Information about vaccination has been given in mosques and temples. As a result there has been a decline in the number of black and Asian people who have not been given the jab.Making vaccines mandatoryCyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic.I have mentioned such passports above. I am not sure if I support such things. I am in two minds about the issue. Part of me wants to support the idea of proving that one is either vaccinated or has had the virus and now have antibodies to it. It is still possible however, to carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms. Passports are not foolproof as a method of reducing infection. Another part of me is concerned about rights and liberties. There is a risk that having passports will lead to people being less cautious about being in close proximity to others. Passports might give people a false sense of security. Passengers arriving in a country on international flights should be tested and, if necessary, quarantined before being allow to mix freely. Even if they were clear of the virus when they boarded the aircraft, it is always possible they could contract the virus during their flight. If passengers are allowed to quarantine at home, their compliance should be monitored. One would wish to believe that everyone behaves responsibly but experiences shows that there are always the few who will do as they please and avoid the restrictions. It is these few who flout the guidelines who are likely to spread the virus. It is very likely that vaccination passports will be used both in other countries and here in the UK.Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldn't be, mandatory?This has been an issue for debate since the start of immunisation. I remember when I had a MMR vaccination. I had no problem with this. I never questioned it. There was a time when we had to have immunisations against certain diseases when travelling to specified areas of the world. I never questioned this. It was something I had to have done or I would not have been allowed into the country in question.Critics of the passport have argued that it infringes human rights. It might well do but then so do already established government prohibitions such as the smoking ban or the taking of proscribed drugs. Preventing the spread of diseases is now one of the most pressing and important responsibilities of all governments. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. COVID will not be the last pandemic to afflict humanity. People have the right to be free from being infected with viruses given to them by others. Thatmight well require mandatory vaccination. Preventing the spread of disease requires infringement of personal liberties. This is not new; it has been going on since the time of the plagues. the word 'quarantine'; dates back to the time of the plagues. In a world where disease can be easily spread, there is no such thing as absolute freedom. One right and easily come into conflict with another right. I support making immunisation mandatory for certain occupations where the risk of spreading disease is great. People can either choose or not choose to work in such occupations but they should not have the right to refuse to be vaccinated if they wish to gain emptoyment. Such a policy should be applied to homes that care for elderly residents. Those who choose to work with people who are vulnerable must accept restrictions including mandatory vaccination, in my opinion. The health of residents or patients is of overriding importance. Everyone has had to refrain from smoking tobacco in public places. Very large numbers of people have had influenza vaccinations every year and this has been going on for a very long time. Holidaymakers have got used to having smallpox vaccinations when travelling to parts of the world where that disease is rife. In my view, most people will accept they need to immunised against a range of diseases both in this country and when travelling abroad. They will get used to having to prove they have had these jabs. These procedures will become embedded in the fabric of our lives.endssent by post 3/5/21"

The first jab was given on the 17th January last; the second given on the 3rd April 2021. Both jabs were administered at a clinic in Blackburn.  I expected to travel no further than the local health centre, as was the case of G, but for some reason I had to travel to Blacburn. On the first occasion, the vaccine clinic was crowded with people.  After registering at a desk, progress towards the vaccination cubicle was slow.  There was much sitting and waiting.  Finally, I reached at the cubicle in which sat a female doctor who asked several questions before inserting the needle into my upper arm.  Overall despite the apparent lack of organisation, the atmosphere in the clinic was friendly and good tempered.  I waited a further fifteen minutes before being allowed to leave the premises. On the second occasion, there was far less waiting; progress to the cubicles was faster, and I discerned that there were fewer volunteers.  A young nurse gave the jab.  Again I had to wait another fifteen minutes before I could leave. The only side effect was a sore upper arm where penetration has been achieved. Social distancing and the wearing of a mask are still employed when visiting supermarkets and shops.  I have been classed as â€˜highly vulnerableâ€™ and have sustained self-isolation since this time last year. Only now, since the recent lessening of restrictions, we have made longer journeys by car to destinations where we have avoided meeting other people indoors and have stayed completely outdoors. W3176 The Vaccine Programme The vaccine programme in the local area is hampered by a large section of the population in Blackburn and the surrounding area who are refusing to accept any form of vaccine.  Blackburn with Darwen has been categorised as a problem area, with an above average incidence of infection. Information such as this is frequently broadcast on radio and television, as well as local and national newspapers. Making vaccines mandatory A vaccine passport, for entry into another country, does not concern me, as I have no intention of travelling abroad in the future.  It has already been described as akin to apartheid the notion of such passes to gain entry into pubs and sports venues, cinemas, theatres, and other entertainment venues."

However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? Yes I have been vaccinated and have not received both doses, including my husband. I am so relieved we have a vaccine and am in disbelief it was created in extraordinary time, this is historic, it shows what humans are capable of doing.  I first received information and invitation from the Government, but this confused me, as I wasnâ€™treally aware that I had a separate hospital number, I thought they referred to as my National Insurance number.  They couldnâ€™t find me on the system, so I managed to book myself into a centre near where I am studying. Though a week later my local GP invited me to have my vaccine at the local surgery, but by that time I had already booked up two centres. My first experience was straightforward, there was and still is a positive attitude towards it, the staff were efficient and clear, double checking allthe information.  Itdidnâ€™t taketoo long, though since I was driving I had to sit and wait for fifteen minutes.  I have recently had my second vaccine, again in another centre out of my area, but I was happy with that, again it was very straight forward, lasted minutes, though I had to wait for fifteen minutes.  I noticed on facebook people are posting that they had their vaccine and showing their sticker, actually I received a lollipop not a sticker.  On my first vaccine it was a male that gave me my vaccine, I have no idea if they were trained nurses, I never questioned, I just wanted to get it M3118 done, and on my second vaccine I had a female that administered it, again I have no idea of their background or if they were trained nurse etc.  Though generally happy with both experiences. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) I have had the Oxford with both vaccine shots. How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? On both occasions I felt as though I had the flue, it took me a few days to recover, but generally nothing serious. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? I am still pretty strict about all this, also when my husband had to have a new hip last year I was really disciplined about all this as the operation had been previously cancelled so I made sure there was no excuse for it to be cancelled.  Also I had an operation recently to have my gallbladder removed, again adhering to the strict guidelines, then I went into isolation for fourteen days to recover.  I have however become really uncomfortable in touching/embracing people, which is an odd experience as I am a very tactile person. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? No not at all. How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). Generally through our local surgery, but there is a choice use any other nearby centres. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. I receive all my information from the Government and social media/news/and mail outs from local council.

It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. I have mixed feelings about this, as this raises the old issue about ID cards, it seems it is a back door to implanting ID cards. However we do need to show proof of having had both vaccines, for our own safety and the safety of others.  I have not idea how to do this, but hopefully something that does not infringe on gathering information about a persons life, that should not be gathered, I think this is the general fear, being able to be tracked. I travel a lot, or did pre covid, and hope to return to perform in Serbia this year, so hope something comes in place that means I can travel safely. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory This is difficult, not everyone wants one, though in not having one they/me/you and everyone will be vulnerable if they are infected by covid? The fear factor is playing too much of a role in this topic."

For many of us, our daily rhythms and routines have altered significantly following different government and workplace guidelines. For some, the days may seem to have bled into each other while for others the pace of life has become more frenetic. Time is generally something that is taken for granted but the pandemic has made many of us notice it in new ways. In this Directive, we ask you to tell us how time in your daily lives may have changed– or stayed the same – as a result of the pandemic. At this moment (August 2020), as lockdown is gradually easing in the UK, we would like you to please look back on your experiences of time and COVID-19 so far, consider what itmeansto you for life to get ‘back tonormal’ (if it is) in the present day, and imagine what you think the future might hold. As always, please include anything that is important to you that you feel is missing from our questions. Rhythm and routine of the day, in what ways, if any, has ‘time’ inyour daily life been disrupted? This is super question to be asked, as a conception duration-based artists, I work with the concept of time, performing over time, breaking the boundaries of time, questioning, what is time?And now has time been disrupted in mylife! Wow…… I suppose for me my days are constantly disrupted, that is the nature of my work, though in holding together my household, supporting my husband, having to rethink about the things I value. Yes there has been change, but I would not call it disrupted, it is a way of life, a continuation of living, dealing with each day that is presented, paying bills, shopping, cleaning, making art, cooking, dealing with recent deaths offriends through cancer. Even thoughI personallywasn’t able to do some things, other opportunities opened up that I did not have access before, such as doing online performances as performance and film festivals went digital. In the first days of the lockdown, did your daily rhythms, routines, or habits change? If so, please say how and describe how this felt. Can you recall how these changes came about? I was travelling for a month throughout Japan between February and March, the pandemic had hit Japan, which was in the news. I was travelling with five other conceptual artists from South Korea, Bangladesh, Spain, Serbia, as well as performing with local Japanese artists, in Kyoto, Osaka, Nagano, Tokyo. I found most public places had closed down, in Japan people are used to wearing masks, though there was an abundance of anti-bacteria gel available everywhere we travelled to. People very rarely touch each other in Japan, though I was aware of the contamination of the virus through touch, so was very aware when holding on to rail handles when out in public or travelling on the Metro. There was a massive difference in travel as Tokyo was very empty, in fact most cities we arrived at were very few visitors, most people were also staying at home. Also, there was a massive difference on public transport, trains and coaches had few passengers, when we travelled overnight as a group on an eight-hour journey on a coach would normally be packed, there was just two other passengers and our group. The Japanese Government was keeping the toll of infected people to themselves, because of the Olympics that was supposed to happen, so they weren’t being honest, on ground level people were angry and the lack of communication from the Government. Of course, with the ship that was stranded in Tokyo, with many people who were infected of the virus, was transmitted throughout the world, did cause alarm to the Government, they did their best to conceal information. On the ground people were being cautious, though when I performed in Kyoto, I did use this sense of un-easiness with touch, so used touch in the performance to nervous laughs, playing with the uncomfortableness of it. I was out of touch with the new, as I do not speak Japanese, and could not understand why people were laughing at a performing another artist did using toilet paper. Of course, I later found out how people were panic buying. On returning to the UK I was shocked to see the lack of airport staff and officials not wearing masks, in fact there was one girl standing by the exit as we arrived with a bottle of gel that we had to go over and she then pressed some into our palms, she wore no protection, but generally there seem to be a lack of cautiousness or structure in place to deal with the pandemic. Iwas shocked how my own countrywasn’t actuallytaking it seriously, Iwas in Japan mode, I spent a month being careful, sanitising myself as and when, washing hands etc, but Britain…What is going on! Ido apart time job as and when needed where Ideliver party balloons, so I sent an e-mail asking if they want me to stay away from the shop for two weeks, theyseemed confused bymy request and couldn’t understand why I should. I explained the situation of me travelling in Japan during the pandemic, in the end I managed to persuade them, but they found it strange I was taking this stance. I was happyto be at home with myhusband as I hadn’t seen him for a month, also that week he was due to go in for a hip operation, so I was preparing him for this. It was a week later Britain finally caught up and went into lockdown, it was for me a week too late. My husbands operation was cancelled, in fact I have a few friends with cancer and their treatment was halted!! This was bonkers, these people are trying to stay alive now they are told to isolate. For us, a routine of being together evolved, I got into all the domestic chores, because my partners mobility was decreasing, in fact it decreased dramatically during lockdown. Were they connected to specific government regulation or advice? Yes, we took the advice of the Government, and since my partner is over 75 this also affected what he could do, so he was now limited to staying at home, but I made him as comfortable as possible, ensuring we had enough food, keeping shopping to a minimal. In what ways have different aspects of your life sped up or slowed down? For example, have you been furloughed from work or taken on caring responsibilities? Maybe you’ve been studying online or have taken up new hobbies. Please describe your experience of this. Of course, with the decrease of my partners mobility, things did change, also I use my back garden as an extension of my studio, it is where I make films of my performances and create work. The difference I found was suddenly everyone in our row of seven cottages were now at home all the time, I am surrounded by a school and families, so I had to stop making work as I normally carve into MDF wood, which is cancerogenic, also my neighbour complained about the noise from my garden while they were on a conference call in the back shed. So, this shaped my day, I now no longer had the same freedom that I normally have. I did try to negotiate, but none of the neighbours really wanted to let me know their routine, by asking I was going to fit around with their structure, but I received silence, in fact it all became very odd, I have known many of my neighbours for a number of years, but I felt I was being policed. During the early days of lockdown a friend wanted to come round, I thought it would be ok, as I have a big garden, she could keep her distance, I provided anti bacteria gel, when my neighbour climbed up on his small roof where his twin six year olds normally sit, and he challenged me about the rules and did they not apply to me? My friend left quietly, I was stunned by this, these are people I have known for nine years, I felt his reaction was a response from his wife, who was angry at me earlier that day. Actually, I did write a letter to the neighbours, but never sent it, if I can find it I will include it here. I really felt like I was being policed, my reaction was to shut down, I kept the front room curtain closed, I stayed away from the front of the house when I knew the family next door were in their garden, I removed myself from the back garden when I knew the mother was out the back with her kids doing school work, so I was trying to respect, but I was also hurt by their policing me. (See letter bellow) In fact I found my own behaviour became odd, watching them from the top front window, breaking rules, not keeping the social distance, I realized this craziness, it was sending me bonkers, as now I wasn’t able to reallybewho I am, of course Iunderstood people now have to be at home, but me and my husband are the ones normally around, se we take in peoples parcels or deliveries while everyone attended their jobs in offices away from home, but now we were all around, so this did leave a strange gap. I wasfurloughed, but Idon’t work regular hours, so it didn’t really affect me, but people being around did, also I was supporting myhusband who’s mobilitydecrease was affecting his moral and getting him down, he is on anti-depressants. So, I took to performing more and more via the internet, attending live digital performance festivals. On Gay pride day I did a one-hour live stream from a festival that was being conducted via New York and streamed to different countries around the world, it was really interesting, defiantly a different way of working. Also, my regular performance I do on first of the month, I had to do on my roof top. 24.03.2020 Times are changing! Dear xxxxxxxx In light of the Governments instructions of a UK lock down, this indeed makes us all look at how we function throughout the day especially regarding work. As you all know I am with N predominantly based at home, so we are generally here to pick up parcels or take something in. For us most of you are not here; Teaching, working in an office and not home based, travelling. This has now changed and so now we are all here! The reason I am writing this as I feel we need to start communicating to express our needs. Being asked to work from home, isn’t just about being in a shed or a back room or grabbing whatever space available that the kids aren’t playing in, being at home also means that you are going to encounter more what the neighbours are doing, even if that naff music being played, saws, drills or partying. This brings to light the need to make conference calls or needing a wider quieter space to focus think and deal with work that is presented to you to do online. As you know when the sun comes out I usually use this time to make sculptures or woodcuts in the garden, yes to naff music, as I can’t do it in doors, but normally you are allout so I have got use to that freedom. I am flexible as C and A knows when the kids were younger we had a conversation about kids needing sleep so I agreed to only work when the blind is up, this was our code, if it’s down they are in bed and it worked, the reason why it worked is that we communicated to each other and expressed our needs. Shouting over fences to be quiet won’t work, but let’s take a step back and think about what is it do you need each one of us to do? This is really important as the lockdown becomes more intense then it will affect us all. Its ok to express what you need, its ok to say I am working from this time to this time in the shed, in the back room in the kitchen, wherever that is ok, it’s also ok for those withkids to saytheyare sleeping during this time as I know our new neighbours at number fifty have two young ones. Yes, we are all in this together whatever that means, we can create that meaning, we can care and support for each other since we live in seven isolated cottages all our gardens back out on to each other. Personally, this will help me to know what you need during your allocated work time and I amsure it willhelp you to know that weallhave time towork. Mysuggestion is aWhat’s App group so we can message anything that seems to be the most flexible way to communicate, especially when we have to keep our distance. Its strange times and I really understand your need to work. I will respect what you need, so do let me know. I know this isn’t about me but allof usand we need each other. I am adding phone numbers as I know we all know each-other, hopeyou don’t mind as I am aware that S and A haven’t. S&N ( )Ididn’t put N’s number as he doesn’t do what’s app A: xxxxxxxxx C: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx ( T: xxxxxx K&D: xxxxxxx I&J: xxxxxxxx S&A: xxxxxxxx This is my attempt to get some communication started so we can be clear about your working time needs, also in this time, it may also mean supplies etc. I am happy for someone to create the group. I know the coming weeks and months it will hit all of us hard in some way but since we have never experienced an epidemic like it, it involves flexibility and respect for each other. Regards S xxxx As I said I ended up not sending the letter, but felt that people were being guarded about their time, I did text one neighbour asking for her work time, I got a blanket response from 8am to 5pm, there were no compromises, which is sad, as I know they went away at times, I know that theyspent acouple ofhours in the allotment, but theyjust didn’t want me to know. These are the same people that often contact me to say they are away and could I pick up parcels etc. People changed, people didn’t feel they wanted to make any kind of commitment about their home routines, all I was trying to do is get some clarity so I know to give them that time and space to concentrate with their work or teaching their kids. Many people have spent more time than usual in their local environments. If this is the case for you, have you noticed anything in particular about the rhythms of the environment around you, such as the timing of seasons, plants, animals, the sun, and the moon? I have spent more time at home rather than going out, since my partner had to be shielded, I had to cut back going out, I only went shopping, never did any exercise, so got fatter, but became more interested in turning the garden into a garden, it was more or less filled with remnants of previous art making, rubble, sawdust, piles of garden waste, the garden and the studio morphed, there wasn’t a balanced space. So, I decided that it was important to create an amazing garden space for my partner as he was unable to go out. Every day for seven days I took a carload of rubbish to the local recycling depo. It was hard work, eventually a garden appeared, so I bought lots of plants, done some replanting, and after my little blossom tree had blossomed I gave it a heavy pruning after doing some research, it was important to do it mid-summer, which I did, it only had leaves on it, but my neighbour took offense to it, she accused me of cutting my tree down, in fact she became so unpleasant about the whole pruning, and saying she had talked to horticulturists who said I should not have pruned it and should have waited until the autumn. Actually it is my tree I planted it in 2004, I know it fairly well, and got to know it even better, it was spiralling upwards to the sky, so all the blossoms went upwards, not in the garden. As we speak my tree has recovered, it looks amazing, new shoots, new branches, as experts have said to me, if I did it any later the new buds would not survive the winter, also because the nature of the tree, it is prone to infection and would die in cold weather, thankfully we have had sunshine so this has helped, also I have fed it, I do not now need to feed it until next year in March, being early spring flowering, I am looking forward to seeing how it blossoms, if any. I have seen TV programs where neighbours fall out because of trees, I never thought it would happen to me, there they are doing sweaty workouts in their garden, puffing and panting away, I can’t sit in the garden when they are working out. The nicest thing was the influx of the local wildlife, birds collecting to build nests, and also to get food for their young one, bumble bees had made a hive so they collect pollen throughout the summer, the squirrels were naughty, in fact one fell down my chimney, the bedroom filled with rubble and soot, so I decided to climb up on to the flat rood, which I have patio doors out on to, that can take me to the pointy roof where the chimneys are, so I could place a rope down the chimney and the squirrel can climb up. So I got ladders out, set them up beside a cast iron pipe, and realized my ladders were inches short so leapt up onto the roof and holding onto the old cast iron pipe, it then gave way, I was clinging on, it snapped, I went crashing on to the roof, hitting a sky light and a tone of cast iron landed on my body. I lay numbed and in shock, I could hear my partner shouting, what has happened, my neighbour who was being much nicer towards me by this time opened the window to see what was happening, I was limping, saying, I am ok, I am ok, I am alive, I am alive. It could have had a different ending! for a whole month I was unable to move, now the interesting thing Ihad to dealwith was the question: “Is this classed as an emergency?” I wasn’t bleeding, not coughing up blood, no swelling, I didn’t have concussion, thoughI managed to work out that I had torn all the tissue in my groin area and my shoulder, but was this an emergency? Idid ring the Doctors, but found their message really cold,don’t come in if….. Don’t come in ifyou have this or that orahigh temperature. Actually, Iwent into shock and was perspiring, so that meant Ihad atemperature so couldn’t go in. Iwas left confused and disoriented by what I should do, in the end, I spent time recovering from the fall, it took about a month, in the meantime, I was enjoying the visits from all the local wildlife, and yes the squirrel did escape the chimney! My partner also mentioned how the wildlife was more visible, every day there was birds dancing around the garden to get works, the bees were also drinking water from a bucket I left out amongst the flowers, actually every animal knew were the water was and took turns, it was lovely, also I had bought a new swing seat, which my partner loves as do I. Someone had called out the fire brigade to rescue some young swans in the Brooke, (Five engines turned up!!) I think people were going a bit daft, but to call the fire brigade, was insane, and it wasn’t even a fire or an emergency??So maybe I could have called an ambulance.

For those of you spending most of your time at home, how do you make distinctions between different times of the day? Yes, things have changed, now restrictions have been lifted, hospitals were getting back to usual business, so my partner who was due for his operation for a new hip days before lockdown, had been cancelled, he was now offered a date. We had to do some serious shielding, it was easy, as we both have two cottages with a connecting door, so he would stay in one area, I would cook, leave his meals on a table, when he needed the toilet or the kitchen, I would vacate the area and let him get on with it, I had also placed antibacterial spray everywhere. Days before his operation, we had to wash his body with an antibiotic liquid. The operation happened, but while he was kept in hospital as they suspected he might have Covid, which he didn’t, this gave me time to put abed downstairs, as hewould not be able to managed the steep stairs. Also, we had bought new beds with electric that raised half of the bed, to enable him to get in and out of bed easier. I managed to create the downstairs toom where he had access to everything, tv, computer and a small table to eat at, which has worked really well. His recovery has been slow, I have dedicated myself a hundred percent to his recovery, doing all the cleaning, cooking, assisting him in the shower, observing for any growths etc, also applying antibiotic liquid to his skin, his scar healed up very nicely. Meanwhile I decided to paint the front of the cottages, which look great and generally doing what I can around the house. My partner is retired, so he spends a lot of time in the house, also over the course of the year he had lost all confidence in going out and became more dependant on me to take him to places. Now he can drive again, his independence will increase, so I look forward to him being more active. This year I had planned to do more international travelling and promote myself as an international artist, as I have found that opportunities in the UK is almost nil, though during the intensity of lockdown, there were some good on line opportunities, but strangely these have now dried up. I was due to return to Islamabad in October, but that was cancelled, I have been trying to get them to do an online festival, sadly they never took it up. In meantime I was invited to Serbia, one of the artists I travelled with in Japan is from Serbia and runs a festival there, which he invited me, then restrictions came and so he had to create an online festival. For me I felt as a conceptual duration-based artist I wanted to perform live, I looked at the Government website, it says I shouldn’t go, but cannot define what it means bysaying “essential” travel. To me this is mylivelihood,it is mylife Idepend on live festivals, though the online opportunities were good, it is not the same, in fact this is an extraordinary opportunity to deal with the question of restrictions, cleanliness, and to explore what it actually means. So with this in mind I made the decision to attend the festival, even though most of it is on line and some locals will perform live, only to a limited to audience gathering, but the piece I am doing is about cleaning, so I will be isolated in Serbia to do a seven to eight hour cleaning performance! One person asked me was this ethnic cleansing? Interesting question, no. I have purposely not mentioned it on-line just in case people send me negativity and try get me not to go. I feel every country in the world are all doing the same thing, keeping a distance, washing our hands, wear masks etc, even in the airports and flying, if it were that dangerous the airports would be closed down. Yes, I am happy to go into quarantine on my return, Ihave no issue with that. (IflyMondayin acouple ofdays’ time) Also the other opportunity has come, over the year I have saved up some money, so have decided that I want to celebrate ten years of doing a well-known performance I do, I wanted to mark the tenth year, so have decided to publish a book and have employed a local graphic design company to design it, then I will self-publish it and promote it through a local bookshop, my aim is to keep it local. I have no idea how the rest of the year will pan out or what will happen, but I reckon I will be spending more time at home, however as my partners confidence increases I look forward to us both doing more traveling. Do you describe these times – to yourself or members of your household -in any new ways since lockdown? For example, do you have particular times of the day you leave the house to take a walk or have meals? What factors influence the organisation of your time? I am beginning to go out a bit more, though my partner does a lot of sleeping, so I find most of the morning I am left on my own, though I have tried to get him up and moving, I really miss the man I married, but I need to be patient to get him back on his feet and to build up his morale, I look forward to having him return, though I have to accept his silence, his snoring, his snoozing the dayaway. Some odd days he will get up,when it’s been nice outsideI open the garden doors, which he can see from his bed. I am enjoying meeting up with people again at cafes, also people are now coming around, at first they would come in the back gate, because I have set the garden up in a way that its social distancing, it is also socially friendly. So, we get more visitors, its rather nice. I am taking to cycling on mylittle Japanese bike, it’s lovely to have that freedomto move about. I can really please myself with my time, though I am doing less art and more domestic duties, like ordering a new fridge, cleaning, and painting the home. (I hate ironing, which I never do) What changes do you anticipate in the time of your homelife in the future? Media and technology I suppose we have been shown that there is far more to technology, I use most the social media anyway due to my performance work as I depend on it, in fact I have more of an online presence. I think before the pandemic we just used the computer for work, research etc, but during it, it has become a vital tool for people to make a living, new online businesses have grown, people have discovered zoom meetings, zoom workshops etc, it’s quite amazing, also even churches have taken to putting their weekly mass online, and I think it has defiantly made them look at how to reach a wider audience. The possibilities are limitless, the more we understand, the more we are able to use technology in every aspects of our lives. Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to family or colleagues using online tools, having online medical appointments and/or shopping online? If so, has using these tools made a difference to how you manage, schedule, or plan your time? Yes, I do more zoom, more e-mails, however I have tried to keep up with slow mail, so sent out forty postcards to other performers from all over the world, no idea if they got them, it cost a fortune, but I felt it was important to keep some human contact. My schedule is what I make it each day, but it is nice to be able to get out more. Though I haven’t returned to exploring art galleries, I haven’t travelled to centralLondon since the lockdown, though recently drove to the south of the river to the celebration of fifty years of Gay Liberation Front exhibition that happened. Did other materials – for example, notepads, diaries, wall calendars – feature as well? What did you use them for? I don’t use wall calendars, thoughI do keep a diary and have tried to write down what Ihave done each day, also when I was recovering from my fall I kept note of my well-being, just in case I missed something with the decision not to seek medical help. I also typed up my Japan journal I wrote while travelling in February and March of this year. If you used new media, technologies, or materials, or changed how you used them as a result of COVID-19, do you anticipate that you will keep using them in the same way in the future? The Spring Directive included a similar question. If you answered it, have your views changed? I suppose I need to use it more, to keep up blogging, keep updating my website, keep updating all the other social media that I promote my performance work, this includes Linked in, Twitter and Instagram as well as Facebook. During Covid I think I used it less as I was at home being the husband and let things slide, even my response to the directives, but other things came in to play, people dying, my friends son was murdered, people diagnosed with cancer, friends teenage daughter surviving cancer, so I got a bit wrapped up emotionally. Waiting forsome people, it seems as iflife has been put ‘on hold’ during the pandemic. Does this feel relevant to you? If so, please say how. Have you experienced a particular pause or a? delay, for instance in waiting for appointments, activities, a new job or for work to resume? What is your experience of waiting? For example, you may have spent time queuing outside shops, waiting for deliveries, or waiting to see friends or family. Please describe how these times felt. I feel in the UK we are impatient, waiting is not in our nature, we do have the stiff upper lip and things must carry on, but people can be awful from my experience. I do not mind waiting, which we have had to wait for a cancelled hospital appointment, we have to wait to quit to get into the supermarket, we have had to wait for a new bed to be delivered as it was cancelled, but we were ok with that. I have had to que an hour each day to get into the local recycling centre, but that was ok as I counted it in as part of my day, I was so glad I could get in, so didn’t mind the wait. For those who have been directly or indirectly affected by illness during the pandemic, how have you experienced time and waiting in particular in relation to incapacity, recovery, loss? And grief? Yes it is strange not being able to attend a funeral, sadly a close friend died recently, but there is no funeral. I have been dealing with grief for a few years, I think having the time throughout the pandemic has strangely helped. I was drinking far too much last year, but decided to stop for good, then I was diagnosed with Gall stones, but I cant go to the doctors to try to get an appointment to have an operation to get them removed, its not an emergency, so have to live with the pain. I do not think it will do us any harm to learn a bit more patience and to learn to wait for things, rather than have everything in an instance."

There is a sense of weariness about life, and I know from conversations with others that many feel the same as me. Over the past couple of years everything has been subject to disruption and the levels of uncertainty come and go in unremitting waves.  Now there is a new COVID variance which may or may not be resistant to existing vaccines.  Inevitably there will be question marks over Christmas and seasonal get-togethers as a result.  I have arranged a family Christmas, but it may not happen if it is decided that new restrictions need to be established.  I am so tired of all this. I’m not frightened but I am tired. No doubt I, like many others, will shrug my shoulders and just get on with it.  What else can we do? I certainly won’t be taking to the streets to shout and yell.  What’s the point of that?  Nobody listens anyway. I’ve had all of the jabs and I’ve also had my flu vaccine so I will trust that I’ll be ok, even if I get COVID. There is no such thing as normality now. What we regarded as “normal” has gone for ever. There is a new normal now and we’d best get on with it.  There are some things which are good and other practices which are tiresome but that is the way of things. In establishing the budget for next year we have allowed for significant price increases across the board. That will have impact, of course, upon our levels of disposable income. We were hoping to be able to travel to Australia to visit my son and his family.  We haven’t seen them for over three years, and I know that it is getting to him as much as it is to us. Whether the changes outlined in the above mean an extension of this period is difficult to know.  The current situation is so fluid that it may well be that we cannot travel for some time yet. Our biggest concern is that we will get over there and then find that we cannot get back.  There is still a need for caution at the moment, so we’ve decided not to book anything until after winter has passed. Our current energy providers are established national companies (British Gas etc) so I assume that there will be few problems there in terms of provision, but I do expect significant price rises to follow.  I am reducing the levels of use in terms of heating and lighting because I do feel that we waste a lot of energy (lights on in rooms which we aren’t using and so on) and I am engaged in a constant campaign with my husband over this. He seems to be more cavalier in approach and I seem to spend a lot of time in going into rooms, switching off lights that he’s left on. It really irritates me. I always purchase a poppy badge every November.  My dear father was in the Royal Artillery during the war, and I know that he had a pretty dreadful time in the Far East. Since then others have made similar sacrifices.  It is not a comment on the politics of the situation.  It is an appreciation of the commitment that such men and women have made, and it is not something to be taken for granted.  I’m happy to think that my few quid can assist in making those lives a little easier. I lived in Basildon when I was first married.  David Amess became the town’s MP in 1983. He was prominent in the town and seemed to be an affable soul.  I didn’t always see eye to eye with his politics, but I could see that he had the courage of his convictions and I respected that. Later, once we had moved up north, he became MP where my daughter lived in Leigh on Sea. They were also poles apart politically but my son in law taught at the local comprehensive and Sir David visited frequently. DG showed him around the school, and they discussed educational matters which affected the school.  DG did not share his political views, but he did accept that he was sincere in his beliefs and wanted to do the best for his constituency and for the people who lived in it.  They simply had different ideas as to how that might be achieved. DG also played in a local band and Sir David always turned up to the Leigh on Sea Folk Festival, held every year before COVID caboshed the whole thing.  From that point of view he will be missed, a fine constituency MP, who genuinely cared. For that reason alone DG and my daughter will miss him. The terrible violence of such an attack upon such a man is abhorrent in the extreme and my thoughts are with his wife and family who have to carry on knowing of the horror which befell him. I don’t mind governments doing U-turns if it is done for the right reasons, (i.e. we’ve made a mistake, we were wrong to think that and so we don’t do it). I wish that I could believe that this is the situation re the Owen Paterson incident.  I fear not. They have been rumbled and had to take steps which wouldn’t have happened had they managed the situation properly in the first place. The whole situation re politics at the moment is causing me great disquiet.  There is a lack of dignity, honour and truth here.  Maybe that has always been the case, but I never used to think so. We seem to be out of control, scrambling from one buffoonery to another. The other fact is that the mistakes which are made are so basic that you wonder how on earth we can carry on in this Keystone Cops fashion.  A bunch of clowns steering a car which is about to fall to bits in the middle of the circus. I am not a member of a political party.  In terms of beliefs I tend to steer a middle course, a little to the left of centre but not excessively so. If you really need to affix a label to me I guess that I’m a left of centre Conservative (yes, there is such a thing and there’s quite a few of us). I believe in compassion for the weak and help for people to establish better lives for themselves, as it will be paid back ten-fold if we do that. But the entitlement brigade can bugger off.  Some people in this area, who’ve never done anything worthwhile, are selfish and ignorant, and feel that they are somehow entitled to this that and the other just because they are of a certain age.  No. You’re not. HRH Duke of York has never been a favourite of mine. He comes over as being selfish and feckless.  Now I am aware that this image is rather engendered by the media and so I do approach this with a degree of caution.  But it is clear that something has been going on and he should be doing his utmost to assist the authorities to get to the truth.  The interview in which he participated was a total embarrassment.  If there is nothing to be ashamed of he should simply co-operate and let the legal authorities in the USA know that he is willing to help.  This apparent reluctance to help does rather raise suspicion that he has been involved in a murky situation. How dare he be so arrogant to consider that it is unnecessary for him to help where it is clear that he may be able to. Poor Queen simply doesn’t need this on top of everything else. He needs his arse kicking."

I was surprised to get a text from my surgery to ring for an appointment for the first dose that early, as my age group wasnâ€™t yet due for the vaccine. I understand that my GP surgery joined with a couple of others in the locality, to set up a GP group vaccination centre, so allowing them to get a little ahead of the planned roll out. The centre was set up in a nearby social club around a mile or so from my home.  I decided to drive rather than walk, as I knew I would be nervous and the route involved a steep hill on the way, so I felt I would arrive even more flustered than normal.  There is plenty of car parking there, and there were volunteer stewards checking with people at the entrance to the car park who asked us to wait in our cars until the time of their appointment was reached. The route through the social club was one way, with stewards checking temperature on the way in, and there was social distancing in the queue inside. There were about six people in front of me waiting to be checked in at a desk part way along the queue.  Quite quickly I was processed and joined the queue into the main vaccination room.  This was along a hallway divided in two to separate people going in and out from the vaccination room.  The queueing took around 10 minutes overall. There was a calm atmosphere, everyone wearing masks, and with so many stewards giving helpful instructions, it was all very straightforward.  The main room had chairs spaced out, facing the entrance, with backs to the vaccination stations at the back of the room. The chairs were where those vaccinated had to wait for 15 minutes (as required by Pfizer to check for adverse reactions). I took off the jacket I was wearing over a T shirt and waited in the queue at the side of the room and was called forward almost immediately when by a steward.  I think there were around six or so vaccination stations, each had a table with a clerk sitting at the far end of it, with a laptop.  The vaccinator was standing at the front of the table, with the vaccination paraphernalia set out.  He introduced himself and just gave me his first name; I heard the vaccinator on the next station introducing herself to her patient as â€˜Dr â€¦â€™ so obviously this then asked me several questions about recent other vaccinations, allergies etc, then in which arm Iâ€™d like the vaccination.  I chose left, was directed to put my hand on my hip and was vaccinated.  Only the clerks were sitting at the vaccination stations. This appears to be different from other centres, where friends and family said they sat down to be vaccinated.  Standing wasnâ€™t a problem and speeded things up. I was then asked to sit and wait for 15 minutes on one of the chairs in the waiting area and was given the time I could leave (there was a clock facing the waiting chairs). Stewards sanitised the chairs between occupants. They had a system of placing a new sanitising wipe on the stretcher at the rear of the chair when anyone sat down (on a previously cleaned) chair.  As soon as they saw an empty chair with a wipe, they knew someone had just left and it had to be cleaned immediately. It was then ready for the next person to occupy, and when they did, a new wipe would be left on the stretcher. After my 15 minutes, I left through the same door to the vaccination room as I had entered, but along the designated side, and left through an exit door.  I felt the whole process was really well organised, and everyone was very helpful.  The only side effect I experienced from either jab, was a slight tenderness at the injection site. The second jab was administered by a different vaccinator to the first, and was marginally better, in that I had less tenderness. The systems in place were the same for both jabs. I have had a blood phobia since childhood and hated needles, feeling faint on more than one occasion and passing out once, but refusing vaccinations such as the measles and chickenpox vaccinations, the BCG in secondary school, or a flu jab at work during the 1989/90 epidemic, was never an option as my parents and I knew the importance of protecting myself.  I have become less sensitive and anxious about needles as I got older and I started having a winter flu vaccination when I began caring for my late husband when in my 50s. I have continued to pay for a vaccination each year, though will soon qualify for the NHS one. I was interested to notice that the NHS flu vaccine last year had one less strain than the private one. That might make me consider paying privately in future if that is an option. My sister has taken part in the two dose Janssen vaccine trials. She is a Type 1 diabetic and has been involved in numerous research programmes for years. She was diagnosed aged 11 in the sixties and was given a relatively short life expectancy (to early adulthood only) so considers herself â€˜well past the sell-by dateâ€™!  She considers she owes her life to research so has always been keen to give back to research studies. Therefore our family has always understood the importance of science, research and of vaccinations.  I have faith in the scientists (more so than the politicians). I signed up for the Zoe Covid Symptom Study in August 2020 and enjoy contributing to that research. I still follow the government guidelines (late June 2021) and restrict my own social interactions although I have become more relaxed in the last few months.  I have gone back to an outdoor volunteering role, though this usually only involves three to six people.  I do less click and collect supermarket shopping and have been into three local supermarkets, but mainly sticking to the one that is quieter and better organised. I see one friend on a regular basis and we have been travelling to places in separate cars for walks. For the last three weeks we have been going a little further afield (still within ten miles) and have started sharing a car. The first trip we wore masks, but decided as we are both fully vaccinated, and mix with few other people, we feel comfortable with just the windows open. We are now sitting indoors at cafes where we feel the covid precautions are good.  We still socially distance from each other and are careful when out and about, although I donâ€™t feel as worried as I used to do, when I pass other people outdoors. We recently took a two hour cruise along the coastline from Plymouth.  The boat had restricted numbers and although there were more people than I would have liked on board, and I felt a little anxious waiting in the queue, we were outside at all times and we were able to distance from others. We were asked to wear masks the whole time.  We were relieved to sit opposite each other with empty seats next to us. This outing was a kind of test to see how we felt about doing something different. We had spent over a year walking in just three or four places repetitively. Being outdoors on a windy boat seemed a good step to making a trip we had wanted to do for a long time. The G7 summit in Cornwall has now taken place and seeing the crowds, the delegates mixing at meetings and barbeques etc, was a bit worrying.  There have been noticeable spikes in infections in St Ives, Carbis Bay and Falmouth, all key locations for the summit, although the health officials, politicians and scientists are attributing those to the half term holiday prior to the summit, and the university campus. I donâ€™t enjoy being anywhere too busy, so tend to avoid crowds, pandemic or not. I had to go into the city centre in May for the first time in nearly a year, as I needed a new optical prescription.  I went in before the relaxations on 17th May as I felt the city would be quieter. I was pleased to see the indoor shopping centre had one way systems in place, so people were not milling about all over the place.  I wear a mask whenever required to, and sometimes even when not (like in the street between shops) and feel happier when I see others doing the same. I think the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions are as good as they could be, considering we are still feeling our way through this pandemic.  Iâ€™m in favour of slowing things down, if anything, but I appreciate that wouldnâ€™t impact on me as much as it would on businesses, working people, families with children etc.  I certainly didnâ€™t think the restrictions should be eased on the 21st June considering the rising cases of the Delta variant and was glad they didnâ€™t change dramatically. Once I started volunteering again and began mixing more in supermarkets I began doing twice-weekly self-test rapid antigen tests and reporting results to the Zoe Covid Symptom App.  It gives me confidence to go out and about and I feel it helps the data being compiled. Also the spikes in infections in Plymouth and especially Cornwall make me want to check on myself.  I find the test quite uncomfortable to do but am persisting as I feel it is important. I ordered the first box online, then picked up another from my library. The vaccine programme There has been good information available on local TV and radio stations, about the roll out of the vaccine programme, explaining when different age groups were eligible and where to book. There have been a range of places and means of booking.  There are several vaccination centres in Plymouth, but there have been some reports that in the early days booking proved problematic for some.  Some of that difficulty seems to have been generated by mis-information on social media compounded by the system drawbacks.  For example, some nursery workers had read that they qualified as â€˜social care workersâ€™ so were allowed to book a vaccination appointment online.  The system allowed them to do so, but when they arrived at the vaccination centre, they were turned away as they were not actually eligible at that time. Vaccinations have been available at different times and places in Plymouth for the various eligible groups, at GP surgeries, hospitals and vaccination centres at sports grounds. The first big vaccination centre to open was at Home Park, the Plymouth Argyle football ground. They have been dealing with those eligible for vaccinations that book through the NHS online system.  Some GP surgeries have been contacting patients directly saying they could now book a slot at Home Park or alternatively wait until called by the surgery to have their vaccination there. In the first week or so of the rollout, there were long queues at Home Park and as the weather was very cold, this was not ideal for the elderly patients who were the target group at the time.  A friendâ€™s 94 year old mother was the first person I heard of, who had their vaccination through the main vaccination programme. She had the Astro Zeneca jab but that was administered at her surgery which made it easier for the family to manage for her as it was so local.  The Home Park centre would certainly have been more difficult for her to navigate. She was given her second appointment at the time of her first jab, although it was later postponed for a short time to allow for younger groups to have their first vaccination earlier than originally planned. Appallingly, a little later, the tent being used for patients at her GP surgery to socially distance while waiting for their vaccination, was stolen overnight, so that put some appointments back.  My friend who uses the same surgery as her elderly mother, was offered Home Park, or a wait for the GP surgery and she chose the latter. She was then pleased to be called shortly after, albeit at short notice on a Friday, for a Sunday morning appointment. She seemed to be the only one being vaccinated there at the time. That was also Astra Zeneca. When I had a text from my GP in February, inviting me to ring for an appointment at their own surgery group vaccination centre, as I have described above, I was relieved I wouldnâ€™t have to go to Home Park. My sister had already had two Janssen jabs by December (she was only unblinded earlier this year when offered a jab in the general rollout, so needed to know). Her husband who is a bit older, in his 70â€™s, heard from a friend that the main hospital at Derriford had some appointments available for the Pfizer jab.  This was before his age group was generally being offered the jab.  He was able to book an appointment on a day when my sister had a clinic appointment at Derriford, so that made it easier for them to organise. Until recently my niece-in-law was a junior sister in ER at . I believe she had her vaccination fairly early in the roll out. She is still working for the NHS in a teaching and mentoring role, doing some pastoral work to help staff cope.  Unfortunately the pressures on ER have meant they have called on her to do some shifts in ER as well.  I have been fully in support of priority groups, key workers etc, being prioritised for the vaccinations.  However, my nephew in his thirties, has not been eligible until relatively recently, although he has asthma and other health conditions. That was a bit of a concern when his wife was coming home, especially last year, having spent long shifts in Emergency.  She has been quite laid back throughout about working throughout Covid. Hospital at has a large contingent of Naval medics, and she believed this contributed to the very disciplined approach to the organisation of the hospital in dealing with the pandemic.  I think that on the whole, the roll out of the vaccines has been as well designed as it could have been, considering the issues of supplies and logistics, although I was very concerned when there seemed to be a slow roll out to social care workers, especially those working in residential homes. Considering the mistakes that were made in not protecting those communities in the early stages of the pandemic, I felt this should have been much more of a priority. I get most of my information about the vaccine from what I consider reputable sources; mainstream news channels, especially BBC News channel (which has more detail than the headlines on the news bulletins), Spotlight (local TV news programme) and Radio Devon. The local news stations are helpful in offering information and advice, for example when the walk-in vaccination centres opened at Home Park for over 23 yr olds and over. The first times they opened were between 2200 and 2300, indicating the efforts the NHS is making locally in targeting the younger age groups at times convenient to them.  I find the contributions in the media from local officials, such as university virologists, regional Directors of Health, very helpful as they give specific, easily-understandable explanations of the stages in the pandemic, the reasoning behind restrictions and the vaccination roll out. They generally have no political axe to grind and I feel I get reliable information. That isnâ€™t to say I donâ€™t question some statements (still a bit skeptical about the statements that the G7 didnâ€™t cause the recent spikes.  Even if the delegates themselves were covid-safe, the immense logistics of moving Police and building contractors and hospitality staff into the region must have had an impact). The national briefings can be helpful too; one on 14th June confirming the Governmentâ€™s decision not to follow the planned opening up on 21st May, did explain the reasoning behind the decision. However sometimes the presentation, the numerous graphs concerning statistics and the predictable questions of the media, can be disengaging.  The discipline of a short story within a local news programme is somehow more focussed and gets to the point more quickly. Seeing the same local science reporters giving updates, is reassuring. I get daily email updates from Gov.uk which offers a huge range of information and has been an eyeÂ­opener in terms of the work going on behind the scenes, and it gives me an easy link into the Covid pages on the website for any other information I need. I have recently been reading about the variants of concern, under investigation and being monitored. Such a complex picture that feeds into decisions being made about restrictions.  I havenâ€™t often looked at the NHS website unless I get a link from other places.  But I would always select an NHS site following an internet search for Covid information, over any other medical site. I donâ€™t buy hardcopy newspapers at the moment but do look at articles on online sites such as The Independent, The Guardian, The Times, Western Morning News and Plymouth Herald.  The Zoe Symptom Study App and their YouTube channel, also provides me with a scientific source of information, giving regular updates on statistics, vaccines, ongoing research, predictions etc including local results, which I can then check against the information generally available in the press. It seems to me that the research by Professor Tim Spectre and colleagues has on the whole produced more up to date data on symptoms and infection rates and shown more positivity and confidence throughout in talking about effectiveness of vaccines etc on infection rates than other sources. Therefore when Tim Spectre in his latest weekly update, talks about the threat of the Delta variant and caution being needed, I know it is a particularly serious development. I can track my lateral flow tests on the app, and there is a timeline from the date I joined the app, showing the scientific achievements as we move through the pandemic.  There are interesting webinars and blogs available on associated subjects such as nutrition and covid, and the effect of vaccines on â€˜long covidâ€™. When I joined the Zoe study, it was all about tracking symptoms and making the track and trace system more effective by picking up infections at an earlier point than the Governmentâ€™s system of testing only following a limited list of symptoms. The research study has recently been funded to continue its research and is developing into a broader body of work about the virus, variants and effectiveness and side effects of vaccines, and that can only be a good thing. I am generally happy with the information on the vaccines, health advice etc, provided by government and the media.  I deliberately seek out information that Iâ€™m unclear about.  Some of the media presenters and programmes are quite repetitive on points concerning the vaccine roll out, the easing of restrictions etc, but I guess that is inevitable given the broad range of platforms available and the need to reach viewers and listeners who dip in and out of those sources. I think that much of the media, as usual, has used sensational headlines to generate sales and this annoys me as so many people donâ€™t question what they read, but take it for fact.  The byline â€˜day of freedomâ€™ for 21st June and the roadmap for opening up, has made the subsequent delay all the more disappointing for many people. I guess a lot comes down to both peopleâ€™s gullibility and individualsâ€™ sense of optimism and approach to risk. I get irritated when Boris Johnson gees up his statements by using glib phrases like â€˜termination pointâ€™. I feel very lucky to have had both jabs and think the roll out by the NHS and partners, has been pretty good.  I am fully in support of any vaccination programme and not worried at all.  I have been following the research and development of the various vaccines, and find it fascinating and have not been worried by the scaremongering amongst some people as there is so much factual information available about the vaccination programme, its progress and why it has been so quick to be developed.  I understand why some people may have been worried in the early days of the rollout, but hope they would take the trouble to find out the true facts, as I am more worried about large groups of the most vulnerable people not being protected, than I am about the safety of the vaccines (which I donâ€™t doubt). When the drop in infections and hospital admissions now show so clearly the effectiveness of the vaccination programme, and the Delta variant surges in the unvaccinated population in the north east show the dangers of not being vaccinated, I simply donâ€™t understand the reluctance of people to take the vaccine.  The numerous vox pops undertaken by TV presenters in the street, generate the same tired old arguments from the public unwilling to have a vaccination, that we donâ€™t know the long-term side effects of the vaccines, or that it was developed too quickly, or thereâ€™s no need now, as itâ€™s all under control. One late middle-aged man on TV yesterday, said â€˜Iâ€™m not being coerced into having something injected into me.â€™  The irony is he isnâ€™t being coerced, and he's frankly simply selfish to abdicate his responsibilities as a citizen and not protect himself, the NHS and the rest of society. The extreme opinions of the conspiracy theorists are laughable and incomprehensible to me, but it is not a laughing matter when so many people can promulgate lies and so many others are taken in by them. I donâ€™t personally know any sceptics, and all my family and friends are enthusiastic about the vaccination programme.  However, a friend has a relative currently living in Canada, who is very anti-vaccine.  When he heard his mother had been vaccinated over here, he demanded she hold a fridge magnet to her arm to check for the embedded chip. He is divorced but keeps in contact with the family including his teenaged daughter and during a Facetime session said he hoped she wasnâ€™t going to have it. She told him she certainly was, and if he didnâ€™t have his, then she wouldnâ€™t be going over there to see him, when permitted to travel. I read only today that one of the lies going around is that thousands of sharks had been killed to make the vaccine.  Honestly, it beggars belief. Making vaccines mandatory I believe strongly in vaccination programmes, but I think that making them mandatory for everyone would not be acceptable in the UK. It is just not in our culture to have such a line drawn.  However, I do think vaccinations should be mandatory for health care workers, and the Government has recently brought that in, to be completed in the coming months, against some resistance from social care organisations.  Some residential care homes are pleased that it is now mandatory as they have had problems in persuading some of their workers to have the vaccinations.  Others are against forcing people to have them and says it will mean more people will leave the profession which is already under staffing pressures.  I think social care workers should be seen as professionals, who are as vital and important as front line medics in hospitals â€“ who themselves have always had to be vaccinated against various diseases such as hepatitis, to protect themselves and their patients.  As an aside, careworkers should be far better rewarded for doing this vital work. I realise many countries desperately want their tourism industries to get back to normal, but itâ€™s a complex task to work out what regulations should be put in place either for people travelling out of, or into, a country.  I have no particular drive to travel overseas, this debate doesnâ€™t affect me personally and I canâ€™t really understand quite why some people are so desperate to travel on holiday this year.  Especially when a green country could quite easily be changed to an amber one, while you were away on holiday. I understand the importance to some of visiting family in certain circumstances, or for work, but am somewhat impatient to read about leisure travel. It is filling news bulletins at the moment.  I also think â€˜elite sportsâ€™ travel still being permitted with exemptions from restrictions that the rest of us have to bear, is pretty galling. However, if travel is being allowed, then vaccine passports for foreign travel seems to be a sensible step, especially if this facilitates the arranging of travel insurance for example. It is up to individual countries to decide what documentation/mandated treatments are required for entry. I donâ€™t have any issue with such passports for major events, but it would be difficult to police in some situations such as pubs.  I know that hospitality venues have reported difficulties in policing masks in some instances â€“ how much more difficult to do that with passports."

I didn’t begin writing this part until 6 July so now I have some perspective on the last few months. have been keeping a journal since March and I can see how my experiences and feelings have changed during lockdown. I am not a risk taker and happy to follow any instructions, so despite not being in the vulnerable category, I was taking precautions and preparing for the worst before the official lockdown. I felt most worried in March to May but can see things are now improving and have relaxed a little in the last month. I am not as obsessive as I was, but am still taking precautions e.g. sanitising post and shopping and not using supermarkets. When I first saw the initial reports coming from China at the beginning of the year it worried me a great deal to hear about people of cruise ships, flying back from skiing holidays etc. Although I could understand why people would be reluctant to lose money or miss out on their holiday, I couldn’t for the life of me see why people would risk their health for that, and were continuing to travel abroad with that looming on the horizon. However I assumed that the UK would be well­organised, we were an island and could isolate easily, that people would be quarantined coming into the country. As an adult I have rarely travelled outside the UK and am always surprised at the huge numbers of people that are always moving around the world and I was dismayed in the early days of the pandemic to see the lack of restrictions introduced to incoming visitors or residents. There was understandably a lack of information about the virus, but the Government simply did not seem to be taking what was happening in the Far East seriously, and it seemed that the overlying assumption was that the UK population would simply not co-operate in the same way as people as China or Korea. I remember one commentator saying ‘we may not ever know if we did too much at the beginning of the outbreak in the UK, but we will certainly know if we did too little’. That has turned out to be somewhat prophetic. At the beginning of the year I had seen a repeat of a BBC documentary first screened in March 2018 about the potential for viruses to spread. This was made in conjunction with Cambridge University, using an app downloaded by volunteers and focussing on Haslemere. It was fascinating to see how a ‘super-spreader’ (who worked in a hardware shop) had ‘infected’ so many other people. And to see it spread throughout the country within weeks, was extraordinary. The threat of a pandemic similar to SARS or Ebola was well known and many scientists and others have been warning us for many years, but we were still not prepared. The hope that something happening in China wouldn’t impact us too much, was quite wrong of course. I am retired but do voluntary work for various organisations including the National Trust. In February I started working at an additional location. The first day a friend and I met the ranger, together with another new volunteer and we shook hands all round and sat at a picnic bench to discuss the work. After a while it transpired that the other volunteer was an English teacher from China, where his Chinese wife and his two children, were in lockdown in the in-laws’ flat. He said ‘don’t worry, I don’t have the virus’ and we laughed, and I said ‘I’m glad I’m sitting upwind of you’. He had returned to Britain before the Chinese New Year, to visit his UK family. Because he could no longer return to China as planned he was looking for something to do. This incident brought home to me just how inter-connected our world has become, and although this was early in the pandemic, and we had no idea quite how it would impact on the UK, it did ring alarm bells. I was already worried about the reports from China. My friend and I were concerned, and I was trying to work out in my head; how far away is Wuhan from the district that teacher had been working? When is the Chinese New Year? End of January. How recently had he flown back to the UK? Before February. How long before our meeting, was his trip? We had met on 21st February, so this seemed to be beyond the two-week suggested incubation period. Phew. My friend and I met a few times after that, to do litter picking on a stretch of the South West Coastal Path and on beaches well-frequented by visitors and with several latched gates on the path. The other volunteer was working elsewhere. The news about the pandemic grew, and though we thought outside activities wouldn’t be so affected, we personally did take precautions by using gloves and a plastic bag to avoid touching gates with bare hands. On 10 March, I attended a funeral of a friend’s husband in Torbay. Shortly before, the first Covid 19 infection in Devon was diagnosed in that area (school students who had been on a holiday in Italy). I did think twice but decided to go to support her. I took precautions like using sanitiser and offering it to people I was giving lifts to, who were all grateful, and although I thought I probably shouldn’t, I did hug my friend once. At the wake at her house later, she directed people to wash their hands, and though I tried to be careful and keep apart from others, I was quite surprised that other people didn’t seem to be worried and were still shaking hands a lot. I felt a bit uneasy, especially handling her crockery, but reluctant to show too much anxiety in such a social situation. Typically British I suppose, not wanting to cause a scene. People talked a little about the virus, but it wasn’t the main topic, and most seemed quite laid back about it, laughing about not being ‘infectious’. I was glad to leave and get home. The last litter picking session was 21 March and my friend and I were travelling there separately, and practising social distancing with each other and other users of the paths, but were concerned to see lots of groups of people not changing their behaviour at all. Worryingly for me, this included a large party walking with my next-door neighbours who wanted to stop for a chat. I did my best to step up a bank to avoid them. The week before lockdown was a weird time; I had a real feeling of being on the brink of something awful. I have a history of mild anxiety and although consider myself resourceful, knew that living on my own would bring additional worries especially if I was to become unwell. That week I had to attend a health clinic on two consecutive days and although advised it would be better not to drive, I didn’t want my sister to take me (she was self-isolating early) and I didn’t want to take a taxi either. The clinic was well-organised and quiet so I felt OK there. Seeing the panic buying in supermarkets on TV was truly appalling. I shopped on the way home from the clinic, including for my sister who hadn’t been able to get certain items on her online shop. I had to go to three supermarkets in total and it was hard not to over-react when seeing those empty shelves. I have a good store cupboard and stocked freezer at the best of times however so wasn’t overly worried. Nevertheless I bought a few things that normally I wouldn’t have bought until I had run out of them, such as frozen vegetables and long life milk. I didn’t need loo rolls though; I normally buy recycled or bamboo products online and had a good stock anyway. I had nursed my late husband and still had some supplies of wipes, sanitiser and gloves, so felt lucky I wasn’t having to worry about those. In fact I was able to help a friend who was having problems getting them. At home I decided to turn part of my ornamental bed back into a veg patch and my last shop was not to the supermarket but to the garden centre to get items for salad and veg growing. I felt relieved that I was prepared for what I thought was coming, but what worried me most at that stage, was the potential risk to my sister’s access to food and medication. I was very thankful that her organic veg box delivery would continue, and that she had been able to sign up for supermarket delivery. That last week I also had central heating engineers visit. I had prepared the utility room and cleared the adjacent loo in case they needed to use it, provided sanitiser, soap etc. When they arrived I opened the front door and stepped back, tried to keep apart from them and was surprised that neither of them seemed particularly self-aware. They obviously had not had any instructions or guidance about precautions or distancing. One clearly had a cold; that was enough to really worry me. Thankfully they didn’t have to stay long, but not before I had to sign their handheld recorder. I really did scribble my signature at arm’s length and wouldn’t hold the recorder itself. After they left I disinfected every surface I thought they could possibly have touched. My anxiety in those days was (and continues to be) tinged with real sadness as I tried to prepare for whatever was coming but I had no-one to really share this crisis with. My late husband was enormously practical and would have thrived on tackling problems and finding solutions. However if the pandemic had happened three years earlier, it would have been horrendous dealing with that in his final months when I had nursed him at home. I still receive support from the hospice that cared for him (and would normally be doing voluntary work for them) and it is sobering knowing that patients and clinical staff are still dealing with terminal illness and end of life situations in the midst of all this uncertainty. I know I am fortunate to have a comfortable home with reasonably up to date technology, a good sized garden, access to the woods nearby etc. I watched with worry about stories of other people without those things. I was glad that daily exercise was permitted from the start and I think that was a good decision. It angered me though to see reports of people not distancing, sharing outdoor gym equipment, cycling closely past others without any consideration etc. I go for my daily exercise early in the morning to avoid other people and only once have had a concern when the paperboy passed me quite close from behind. I am still anxious about touching my gate when coming in and out, and leave the gate open so the postal workers don’t need to touch it. They often courteously close it, so especially in the early days I would go out to wipe it down with bleach (I was sanitising my letterbox every day too). These days I just avoid touching the latch or top of the gate. I have a mild heart condition and while not catergorised as vulnerable or on any medication, decided from the outset before any formal lockdown, that I would self-isolate and not go shopping personally. The first weeks were a strange mixture of a heightened feeling of being alive and connected with the rest of the world through TV and radio and internet, and what it was slowly coming to terms with, but I also felt deep anxiety for what was happening and what this pandemic could mean for our species. We were having to change our way of living, day by day. I felt safe staying at home, discussing with friends and family what was happening and how we were dealing with it, taking part in various activities and events and watching and listening to TV and radio. But it was obvious that the NHS’s ability to cope was a huge issue, and many days I woke with a start, feeling anxious and more conscious than usual of my ectopic heartbeat. My GP had given me the option of medication for my condition, should it become too much of a nuisance, although it is not necessary from a clinical point of view. But because of my experiences caring for my husband, I have a heightened worry about falling ill, let alone think about how I would cope having to go into hospital for any reason during the pandemic. I feel I can cope with the condition by continuing to practise mindfulness mediation, using a programme I discovered several years ago. I have upped my practice, using the website’s new online resources designed for the pandemic. Having a routine of doing this twice a day is helpful, as is walking in my nearby woods early in the morning. I also feel better by preparing for the worst. I have packed a bag with essentials should I be taken into hospital for any reason. I have made out a sheet with my personal details, next of kin, health history etc. I make sure that I don’t leave keys in the doors so that my family can get access if necessary. I also have the backup of Benenden membership which is a friendly society offering a GP and mental health helpline, but thankfully I haven’t yet have to seek any medical advice from there or my own GP surgery. I have developed a sensitive tooth and suspect I might have lost part of a filling, and another tooth appears to have a crack, but unless they worsen I shall wait. My spectacle prescription is due for review but I will probably wait until the end of the year before making an appointment. The problem being of course, that I may be less happy to go in the autumn if there is a second spike. My hairdresser has been in touch to say the salon is back in business, but again I am leaving that for another month or two. I’m not overly conscious of my appearance, can manage at the moment with unruly hair. My hygiene and dress habits haven’t really changed, though I have bought some additional joggers as I am spending every day at home. Because my hair takes longer than before t dry, I don’t wash it every day. I am using make up even less frequently than I did before as I am not going out and meeting people much. It took me three weeks initially to get a supermarket click and collect slot. Luckily my nephew was able to drop some fresh food off in the meantime (he was self-isolating too but managed to get a home delivery through his business) which was a great treat. I hope I’ve always appreciated what I have, but being without tomatoes or bananas for example, for several weeks, reminded me how fragile our supply system is, if people aren’t responsible. The situation has made harvesting my own lettuce, spinach and carrots especially rewarding. I enjoy cooking and have continued to batch cook and freeze as usual. I have to be a bit more creative with some of the ingredients, and substitute if I didn’t have the right items, like making flour out of porridge oats to make biscuits for cheese, as I couldn’t get ordinary flour. I had not used online grocery shopping before the pandemic, but have found it relatively easy to use. I have bought from Tesco and Sainsbury, but overall I find the Tesco operation smoother than Sainsbury, both from the items on offer, the substitutions made, and the ease of the website. Collection slots are much more easily available now. I much prefer to shop in person than online for various reasons. Living alone, the size and quantities offered online are not always appropriate. I am an avid label reader and although supermarket websites do list ingredients, it is not always possible to get the full information. Understandably the shops tend to offer most popular items, so some things I specifically look out for, won’t be offered online. For example, there will be dozens of brands of chocolate biscuits available, but few, if any, made with Fairtrade chocolate and without any palm oil. I have had to make some compromises, such as accepting non-organic milk as a substitute. I like buying loose vegetables if they are the right size, as bags sometimes contain too large a quantity. Buying loose online can be difficult though, as when I ordered two sweet potatoes (I was unable to specify the weight, only the number), they were two huge ones, far bigger than I needed and less practical to use. I have plenty of home-made soup in the freezer made from the surplus of various veg. I am only ordering once a fortnight to make up a large enough order to avoid paying extra for the service, so have had to plan meals in a little more detail than usual. But it has made me consult my books and online websites to find new recipes and that has been worthwhile. So overall my buying habits have had to change slightly. Both supermarkets I have been using allow the buyer to specify if substitutions are acceptable, but only Tesco allows a comment to be made. For example, I could specify ‘free range only’ if organic eggs weren’t available. I drew the line at accepting pen-reared pork as a substitute from Sainsbury when they were out of stock of outdoor bred chops, though I would have accepted any other outdoor reared cut. Some of my friends have had to rely on their family to buy shopping as they don’t have the ability to order online but are self-isolating or shielded. One has had great help from their village community. Others have health issues and are over 70 but have still been going to supermarkets from the outset as they are not confident about using technology and unwilling to contact the supermarket to get priority home delivery. So I feel lucky that I have access to online shopping and a car to collect it, as I wouldn’t have qualified for delivery in the early days, though I guess this might have changed (I haven’t bothered to check, as I am happy with collecting). I was very worried when I went to collect my first order as I hadn’t done it before and concerned about being in proximity to the assistants. I had chosen the largest Tesco store locally as although it was not the nearest to me, I knew the car park was big and wouldn’t be difficult to navigate to the collect point. It was well organised though and there was very little interaction with the staff, they were pleasant and efficient. I had put large open bags in my boot into which I could put the carriers with as little handling as possible. I sanitized the groceries at home, either with a bleach solution, wipes or soapy water and those items I didn’t need to refrigerate or use for a while, I left to one side to quarantine. Where possible I took fruit and veg out of their packing and put loose in the fridge. I continue to do the same procedure. Another thing that worried me about going out for the first time to collect, was the fact that my car hadn’t been used for three weeks. I wanted to test it well before my collection day but worried that starting it might drain the battery so I would need to take the car for a drive to make sure it was recharged. That was technically against the regulations at the time. If I left the testing until the morning of collection of my order and it didn’t start, the breakdown service might not sort the problem in time. I read driving organisation’s websites, talked to people and running the engine on the drive wasn’t recommended, so in the end, I started the car early on the day of collection and then risked taking it for a drive for half an hour to ensure a charged battery. It was my first trip anywhere other than a walk to my local woods and I felt quite worried and guilty about just driving around. I then went out to collect my shopping later in the day. It was those sorts of unexpected issues that took up a great deal of my mental energy and caused me anxiety. Since the beginning of lockdown, I have kept lists of DIY and gardening jobs I want to do, and together with my other interests, I have continued to keep my head down and stay at home. When permitted to do so, I met with my ‘support bubble’. We have met several times since, but not every week. By mid-July this included having a birthday meal in my home, which I would have been very reluctant to do in April. Since restrictions were relaxed, I have been meeting a friend regularly outdoors for a walk and a socially distanced coffee (using our own folding chairs and flasks) and we have been fruit picking. As I started to go out, my diary notes the events like ‘first visit to garden centre’ (last thing in the evening, so at a quiet time) ‘first -and to date the only -visit to shop for groceries in person’(not a supermarket but the local farm shop in a big barn, mask on despite not at that time being required by law) and today as I write this, my ‘first visit to council green waste centre’ (nine bags today – about a quarter of what I will probably end up taking). I have done quite a lot of DIY, clearing and sorting of cupboards etc around the house since the lockdown. I am quite practical and have been able to sort a few problems out myself to avoid calling anyone in. I have also been doing a lot of gardening which is a normal activity for me. I am an avid reader and have been getting through quite a few books, some my own, some ordered through the digital library service, and I have bought some online too. Reading new titles and revisiting old ones. Poetry too, which I enjoy. I wrote a poem for an event for a local music charity associated with the hospice, which was published online and won the contest. I have always found it comforting to lose myself in another world in a book and that applies to TV and films too. I have found particular joy in watching videos like Master and Commander and the Harry Potter films again. I only have Freeview, but with BBC I Player, catch-up TV on my laptop, and DVDs, I have plenty of things to view. I have restarted some tapestry I began some years ago, and have also been practising the guitar. Because I have had to stop my volunteering which I did three days a week, I miss the social interaction that gave me, and the sense of being useful. Although one litter picking group has started working again, I have made the decision not to go back for the time being as the woods where I work (not the local ones I walk to) are busier than usual and I would feel too vulnerable trying to physically distance while working. I don’t see a lot of my neighbours although many of us took part in the clap for carers on Thursdays, so I heard them (I have high hedges around the garden). The next door family is approachable and have been thoughtful, bringing around a cream tea for VE celebrations, and offering to cut part of my hedge. So I don’t feel too isolated. My sister and family live in the same city and although I don’t seem them every week, we keep in touch by phone, Zoom, Whats App and Skype. Zoom was new for me, I enjoyed learning to use it and regret that my other friends don’t use it. I felt the Government’s decision to lockdown to protect the NHS was right but it came too late. As said before, I was worried about people travelling back from places with outbreaks such as Italy but no restrictions being placed on them and that was highlighted when the first case in Devon in Torbay was recorded prior to my attending the funeral on 10th March. I can remember saying to my sister in the early days I was very glad to be in the UK, where I felt the National Health Service would mean the response would be well co-ordinated and organised. That we were an island which would help us to isolate. In hindsight that wasn’t the case, partly to do with ignorance about the virus, the reluctance to really look at other countries’ experiences and take the political decision to shut the country down. So much energy was put into getting the NHS ready, which of course was essential, meant that resources were concentrated there without including care homes into the whole system. It is now clear that many opportunities were missed. For example, too much emphasis was put on getting supplies from large companies of PPE rather than sourcing from the very beginning, from a wide range of smaller organisations. I guess there were bureaucratic hurdles like tendering, to overcome, but this meant that supplies were slow in getting where needed. The construction of the Nightingale hospitals has been an extraordinary effort by everyone, and shows what can be done with the right co-operation but where was the same impetus to resource care homes to ensure isolation of people coming out of hospital with the virus? It was left to individual providers, some better than others, to muddle along; all the time the public was being assured by ministers that supplies were getting through, when clearly they weren’t. (NB: since I wrote this early in July, the Panorama programme on care homes has aired and highlighted these issues). I watched every five o’clock briefing for the first few weeks to begin with, then later just waited for the headlines on the news, as the briefings were taking up too much time to watch. They were an important way to get the latest information, however ineffective sometimes the players (interviewers and interviewees) sometimes seemed to be -questions often repeated by different journalists and not answered comprehensively. But overall, I think they were a useful tool in communicating the restriction, showing the number of infections and deaths, especially in the early days and while accepting the shortcomings in some of the statistics, they were a focal point for the country to engage with. I heard one overseas commentator wishing their country’s politicians and health minsters would do a similar briefing – anything but the silence and rumour-mongering they were experiencing. It is easy in retrospect to see the shortcomings of the briefings, but they were the best we had at the time. It would have been good if the TV briefings had included a BSL interpreter. It’s surprising that all news programmes don’t anyway as a matter of course. Other countries seem to be ahead of us there. Considering the briefings were so important, they should have been as inclusive as possible. There are continuing complaints about confusion of instructions, but I think there are bound to be in such a complex, quick-moving situation. And I think a lot of people tend to expect to be fed instructions, rather than being pro-active in checking updates on Gov.uk for example. I have signed up for the daily GOV.uk emails and so now get much of my information about regulations etc from there. I am impressed by the amount of work going on behind the scenes to address so many different aspects of the Covid legislation, arrangements, etc. Despite all their difficulties, it is quite staggering the way that most agencies are working together to deal with the ever-changing situation. But I also worry about the huge amounts of resource being poured into keeping that all going. I sometimes feel helpless in having to be a bystander in what is happening to deal with the pandemic. I see some great initiatives in some cities to track and trace, some wonderful co­operation, especially across local authorities and devolved governments, and some admirable liaison between research organisations, universities and health companies. I can but hope that someone is pulling together all the best initiatives so that we can implement those if we have a second wave. I have downloaded the Zoe health research/Kings College London app, to take part in the Covid Symptom Study. The only way I feel I can contribute to fighting the virus is through helping with research. I get the majority of my news from BBC national and local radio and TV, and online BBC News (including BBC Sounds). I feel on the whole it gives unbiased news and I like their ‘reality check’ news items. I have relatives in British Columbia who are thankful they have a calm Premier and an excellent senior health official handling the pandemic, which is under better control there than the UK. Yet my cousin still watches BBC news as she finds it has integrity. I watch ITV news occasionally as it tends to be lighter in tone, but I avoid watching Piers Morgan as I find him too confrontational and egotistic. It is interesting to see that in countries like New Zealand and BC where the pandemic outcomes are so much better than the UK’s (though geography and demographics have a lot to do with it, obviously) the political parties in power are on the liberal and left. I wonder if the mindset of a Conservative government not to impose on personal freedoms, had too much influence on the willingness to lockdown earlier, and now is also influencing opening up too early. I listen to Radio 4 a lot; it wakes me in the morning and I listen to the World Service at night if I can’t sleep. In the first couple of months of lockdown, I found myself waking with a start, listening to the news and feeling panicky as the death rate kept rising and almost every news items was pandemic-orientated. I then made a conscious effort to switch to Classic FM or Radio 2 for the alarm. Even listening to Radio Devon first thing was worrying me. However I found it very comforting to listen to spoken word channels during the day as it gave so much helpful information and inspirational stories that were very local to me. Over the months my anxiety levels have dropped considerably and I have gone back to Radio 4 to wake up to. I have reduced the number of TV news programmes I watch; and rarely watch more than the headlines on Breakfast and the six or ten o’clock news, then switch over to something else. It took me a while to watch documentaries about the pandemic. I felt I should have more knowledge about for example, China’s slowness in alerting the world to the pandemic, but I just wanted escapism. Being able to watch on demand has been really wonderful, I am able to ration and pace myself with those sorts of programme. I sometimes read the MSN News feed which is on my phone and get irritated by the sensationalist headlines, the insatiable feed of celebrity and all the adverts, but it can be useful for looking at different viewpoints of news items. Online BBC News has good analyses if you take the time to bore down into it. I am fairly sceptical by nature and try to get a balanced view of events. I have engaged with online activities from organisations I am involved with, and national appeals. I enjoy technology and I worry for friends who don’t have access to the internet or who rarely use even a mobile phone. I feel it is important that TV channels continue to provide terrestrial TV and good quality news and information services for everyone in society. I get frustrated for others, when the only way to engage with a TV programme is via social media, or the GOV.uk website and no other source is offered. Local radio is good in that you can usually engage via text or phone as well as social media. I opened Facebook and Twitter accounts a few years ago as I was missing out on information from voluntary groups I belong to and services I use. I am concerned about such power being in the hands of a few large organisations so I use them primarily as an information service and engage as little as possible with them. I have had to use Facebook more often lately, as local businesses tend to update their Covid opening arrangements via social media rather than on their websites. That puts some people who don’t have access to social media, or who aren’t interested in it, at a disadvantage. A friend recently turned up for a late shopping night (which she had done earlier in the lockdown) only to find it closed as they had returned to their original opening hours but hadn’t announced it on their website, only on Facebook. Some friends (in their sixties and seventies) in the same bereavement music group I belong to, have found the technology hard to manage in lockdown, as some live alone and can’t easily get help when problems arise. Trying to keep everyone in the loop has sometimes been difficult. We have been circulating musical parody videos, funny jokes, quizzes etc, but quite a few in the group have missed out on these. Ironically it is the 80+ year-old who is probably best at the techn"

Mass-Observer gives MO code as MO7145 rather than M7145.,"MO7145, Female, 64, widow, Plymouth, retired administrator  Summer Directive 2020 Part 1: Covid-19 and Time The change to my daily routine owing to Covid 19 has been dramatic, although it follows other major changes that I have experienced in the last five years, so I don’t feel it is the worst one.   From being in full-time paid employment in 2015, I became a full-time carer for my late husband for two years, then found myself doing nothing full-time.  Being widowed in 2017 meant all my time was suddenly my own.  I have always appreciated that time is precious, and having time to oneself can be liberating, but in this situation becoming rudderless made me feel irrelevant and redundant.   I spent three years building up new connections and purposes through volunteering and other organisations.  Then almost three years since my husband died, when I had gone into a different sort of lockdown, Covid 19 arrived.  My time management changed again. In a strange way, in March I felt a greater belonging and connection with the world around me than I had felt for a long time.  I knew so many other people were now having to learn to live a different life to that they were used to, just like me – a more restricted, less useful and sometimes lonely life at home. My three days’ a week volunteering came to a stop.  I have a minor heart condition so I decided early on to stay at home as far as possible even before lockdown.  I am reasonably sociable but not afraid of my own company.  I’m interested in a lot of things, love reading, cooking, TV and radio and the internet, have a sizeable garden and am never bored, so having more time on my hands than ever, never worried me.  I know that being reclusive isn’t very healthy and as I have a lazy streak I knew that without the imperative of my voluntary work, seeing friends or even going out for groceries, I could become hermit-like and my daily routine could well descend into inertia. Waking to R4’s Today programme I often found myself staying in bed longer each day, knowing I had time to do that and that I didn’t actually have to get up for anything.  Listening to the latest pandemic statistics first thing, then on breakfast TV, then news bulletins and the daily briefing, was important to me although I realised this was making me feel more anxious.  I spent a lot of time in the early weeks, with the local radio on, not wanting to miss any important information or announcements.   While continuing with garden and household chores, I was much more aware of the hours passing, as I stopped on the hour to listen to news broadcasts.  Radio Devon was on most of the day, to get news local to me.  I now had a real excuse to spend as much time as I wanted doing nothing except watching or listening.   Waking up to the news sometimes made me feel worried so I would turn over to a music station instead, while deciding what to do that day.  I had no particular routine any more that I needed to follow, and although I was familiar with that feeling since being widowed, I knew I had to establish some sort of time management and give myself something to aim for.   I set up a blackboard and drew up a list of things to do around the house; DIY, seed sowing, pruning, websites to checkout, car maintenance, sorting cupboards, filing photographs, family history etc.  This has been useful and I felt pleased with myself when I could cross something out.  Some of these tasks were season dependent like the veg growing, so I organised those tasks under monthly headings. I also started a diary as I felt that would help me focus on what was happening through the day, and I wanted to record these strange times.  I have not kept a daily diary in the same way before. I try to do this every day but am often surprised when I come to type it up, that I have missed a day or three.  It is often hard to remember what I did, although with my limited activities ‘gardening’ and ‘reading’ could do for days  M7145 when everything else is a blank.  I am finding however that it is less a matter of what I’ve done, as what I’m experiencing.  I try to reference what is happening regards politics, the pandemic, etc, and be more of a documentary about the times I’m living through, but too often it descends into a bit of a rant about my feelings.  Sometimes I read back what I’ve written on a previous day and edit a lot of it out! At the beginning of the lockdown and my initial reluctance to get up in the morning, I decided to try to keep to my normal routine of getting up by 7.00.  Following government advice and permission, I took my daily exercise early before breakfast to avoid other people as far as possible.  I live near a copse of woods and an open meadow, so aimed to walk and be back by eight thirty.  I watched the clock carefully and worried if I was setting out late.   It was never a problem though even I did as it is a quiet neighbourhood.  And even if I spent the rest of the day just reading, I felt I had got out of the house and been active.  In normal times, I might have walked there once or twice a week, but I got most of my exercise through my voluntary work which was physical.  So this was a change to exercise the same amount of time, every day at the same time.  Later in the summer and after being allowed to drive elsewhere to exercise, unfortunately this good habit has not continued. Seeing the woods in early Spring, taking photographs, spending much more time than usual in my garden, I have been noticing the seasons much more closely than before.  As a gardener and working as a volunteer outdoors, I have always loved the changing weather, light, growing things, that we experience in the UK.  But this year it has been more special to me.  More than even I am focussing on my garden as a piece of land to nurture and I am seeing it in more detail.     I am timing things better in the garden than I usually do.  Since establishing the garden when we moved in in 2006, previously I would maintain it and do major seasonal things, like hedge-cutting, and occasionally plant up containers or buy a new shrub.  But often the weeks would slip by, and I would be late planting beans, or forget to buy seed potatoes early enough.  Having decided at the last minute before lockdown, that I had better resume growing vegetables, my last shopping trip was not to the supermarket, but the garden centre for compost, feed, seed, etc.   I planted a range of vegetables and salad crops, quite a few in patio containers as my vegetable patch is partly shaded and not the best place for some crops.  Being at home throughout the day, I am more than usually conscious of the movement of the sun around my garden, and as hedges and trees have grown and matured, I realise just how crucial the sun is for growth.  I trimmed my young oak and cut down a couple of conifers to give more light.  However I have also been more aware this year, of where birds nest, so have had to be careful when trimming, and have timed any pruning accordingly.  I got annoyed when I heard neighbours using hedge trimmers during the nesting season and wonder if any of them are aware of the timings of wildlife cycles.  Many people locally have had building work done this summer, so sitting or working in the garden has been constantly interrupted by power tools and radios.  I sat behind my tall untidy hedges, thinking at least they were giving the birds and wildlife somewhere to retreat to, from other gardens.  I have now trimmed them, later in the year (late August) so I know they will stay reasonably neat until next Spring.   I have a small pond and a couple of frogs and having left islands of long grass in my lawn to grow wild for the insects over the summer, know from previous years that froglets often take refuge in the grass.  I wanted to cut the whole lawn before the weather got too wet (the long grass never gets dry enough to cut if I leave it too late).   It seems that the froglets’ timing is slightly different this year, so when I brushed through the long grass in September, several hopped out.  My timing of the first cut of the long grass islands had to wait until October.  It is now nearly November and with the wild wet weather we are having, I still haven’t completed  M7145 the cut.  I don’t mind seeing untidy borders and rough lawn grass though; very tidy gardens aren’t very wildlife-friendly. I enjoy technology and have spent quite a lot of time this year doing a range of things online: being part of The Mammal Society survey, contributing to the MO, joining a Zoom meeting with the local hospice – even listening to Harry Potter at Home.  In fact the latter has probably brought me as much comfort as anything else during lockdown.  Having a vivid imagination and loving books, I have always found refuge in losing myself in another world, but re-discovering the novels and films and reading features on the Wizarding World website has been really enjoyable.  I am never surprised when I look at the time and find I have spent three or four hours sitting in front of the screen.  I don’t spend much time in social media though.  I use it mainly to get up to date information about local events, voluntary groups, farm shop openings, charity appeals etc.  I find the distractions of adverts, pages I’m not interested in, the sheer rubbish that’s often there, very irritating.  I am fortunate to have bought a new laptop in the last year which has proved invaluable as it is more powerful than my previous one, and faster (time is still of the essence, even in lockdown!)  I have a tablet which is convenient when wanting a bigger screen than my phone, but not wanting to use the laptop.  I also use it when borrowing e-books from the library.  My husband appreciated high spec technology, so the tablet was his and I also use his old smartphone which although must be around five years old, is capable of running apps like the recently-introduced NHS Covid 19 app.  I am now grateful that he invested in these devices.   Although I have more time than ever to sit at the laptop to browse news channels, look at emails etc, I have increased the time I spend on my phone than I did before, as I have time to just stop during the day, sit and browse.  I’m also taking part in things such as the Covid-19 Symptom Study powered by Zoe.  I think it is my current habit of carrying it on me in the garden and house that has encouraged this habit of using it more.  I used to simply leave it on the side or in my handbag, but having it with me gives me a feeling of security and connection. One thing I have noticed in my own behaviour, is that I have had to learn to be patient while waiting for answers to communications.  I belong to a bereavement group (with around 12 of us) and at the start of lockdown, there was a lot of mutual support through emails.  I suppose because I find it easy to use technology, attach digital photos and videos etc, and I have the devices to do it, I worry when people don’t respond in kind.  It began to concern me if I sent something off, to not get a reply within a few days.   I would check the date I sent an email, count the days off and then worry that perhaps they hadn’t replied because I was irritating people by contacting them.   I guess because I was used to certain protocols in my professional life – responding quickly to requests, communicating clearly and copying in the relevant people  – I didn’t appreciate how that discipline needn’t always be applied to life outside work.  It annoyed me that an email sent to a group for a group response, would rarely be responded to, ‘to all’.  To me, that inclusion of everyone, is a way of having a mutual ‘chat’ and keeping in touch with each other.  It also concerned me that I might be the only person who had responded, and felt that was an insult to the sender who had worked hard to bring our group some activities.   However I know that some people might not realise they could send a reply to all, and that others might get irritated by lots of emails coming back.  I decided I was getting paranoid – another symptom of Covid isolation perhaps – and decided to stop counting the days on replies, avoid offering advice such as being able  M7145 to look at a Facebook post from our music project, even if you didn’t have an account.  I now keep my own communications to the group to the minimum.   In subsequent separate conversations, sometimes people  have admitted they had been slow to respond, but still wanted me to keep them up to date.  One was isolating with family and couldn’t work out how to access their emails remotely.  Someone else had problems with their phone, and obviously if that is the only device they have, then they might not be up to date with emails.  Another had tech problems and by the time she sorted it out, she was so inundated with hundreds of emails, she simply deleted all of them.  To my administrator’s mind, that was a heinous crime, especially when she admitted that time felt heavy on her hands.  We laughed, and I curbed my urge to tell her she could probably filter and delete the irrelevant ones.   The loss of personal contact at the bereavement group (which was held at the hospice and run in conjunction with a music leader from a city charity) has impacted greatly on me.  It was a place I felt safe at, that was close to my heart and where friends could share our thoughts and experiences.  We had a lot of fun, and the fortnightly session was probably the most important commitment on my calendar.  Without still being able to meet my friend W who I met through the group, I think I would have really been struggling to cope with my grief, which still simmers under the surface, bubbling up occasionally when I hear a particular song, or hear about someone going the extra mile for someone in lockdown. I just feel fortunate that I’m not having to cope with my husband’s terminal illness during this pandemic, and that I was able to deal with his death, funeral and the aftermath, in ‘normal’ times. I use a wall calendar to track my appointments rather than my phone, and before the pandemic, I would have used a small Filofax as well.  There seems no point in using the Filofax this year as I so rarely need to think about appointments away from home.  I still have engagements written on the calendar such as club and charity events, and it saddens me when I reach a date where pre-Covid, I would have been engaged in interesting and enjoyable events.  These days the main appointments are ‘Tesco Collect shopping’.  I do meet W two or three times a week, for a walk and a coffee, usually taking our own flasks, or occasionally going to a garden centre café.  W is widowed too but is also a carer for her elderly mother, so any arrangements we make are timed around her commitments.  We are both quite law-abiding, so have kept to all the regulations, but have spent more time together than we ever would have, pre-pandemic.  If things go back to normal and I resume my volunteering, that might change, which will be a shame in some respects, but both of us will be able to resume other activities which can only be for the better overall.   My sister and brother-in-law, J & T, live locally, and they self-isolated earlier than lockdown.  Early on we spent a bit more time keeping in touch by phone than we would have done pre-pandemic.  Often to compare notes, discuss the situation etc.  That frequency has long gone back to normal, we speak perhaps once or twice a week.  We are close but have our own lives and were always busy doing something or other, but would get together for meals, outings, and would drop on each other now and again.  When regulations allowed, we met outdoors, in the garden and later in the house (I am part of their bubble) but we have not met frequently.  So overall I would say the frequency of our contact is now more or less than it was before pandemic.  We use WhatsApp more than we did, to send photos and messages and my nephew and wife set up a group chat, so we can keep in touch.  That is a new change, but we don’t use it frequently. We both know each other’s routines, so generally we time our calls to fit in with those.  J has a lifelong health condition that she has under good control with diet and exercise and normally does daily classes at her health club.  That had to stop in the early days so she devised an exercise routine (she is a retired physiotherapist) for home, joined online exercise classes etc.  So her routine didn’t change much, other than she was unavailable to talk while exercising at home, rather than at the club.  Since regulations have eased,  M7145 T’s habit of taking a walk and having coffee with friends has been resumed.  My routine I think has changed the most, in that I would have been doing volunteering three times a week, attending clubs occasionally and now I’m at home more or less all day, every day, except for walks with W.   Despite this change, I don’t find time heavy on my hands.  I could actually resume one of my volunteering roles as it is done outside, but I am still reluctant to widen my circle of contacts and handle equipment, although I know there are protocols in place.  So although I am looking forward to having my calendar full of appointments and commitments one day, I am not counting off the days to doing that until I know the risk has reduced significantly.  With the recent second wave, that looks to be some way ahead.  The weeks seem to be slipping through faster than ever.  That is an effect of getting older anyway, I know.  The changes of the seasons as I garden, the fact that Christmas decorations have been in the garden centre for weeks now, are some of the normal markers of time passing.  However the pandemic has meant that instead of marking the weeks by changes in volunteering tasks (sorting winter clothing for charity shops instead of summer items), social events (fortnightly bereavement music get-togethers, autumn fairs at the local animal sanctuary, autumn horticultural society events),  my horizons – and units of time – seem to have shrunk.  In other words, I am more focussed on home, so notice more keenly the speed at which Friday cleaning comes around, Sunday bed linen change; Monday rubbish collection.  Those things happened before the pandemic of course, but were just the filling between more interesting activities that indicated changing weeks, months, seasons.     As lockdown routines set in, it was the timings of community events such as the VE day celebrations, TV programmes, and Thursday clapping that marked the days of the weeks, rather than the normal working week I was used to.   The timing of government Covid 19 regulation change has been an aspect of the pandemic that I wouldn’t have anticipated would impact so much on people, and to a limited extent to me.  I have friends in Wales, A & N, who were counting off the days back in the summer, when they could finally drive more than 5 miles and so get to see their family or travel to a beach with their dog. Living in Devon, I was able to do that sort of thing much earlier in the year.  They were counting off the weeks, until they could too.   Once restrictions lifted they booked a cottage for September, at that time several months away.  The restrictions that subsequently came into effect in September in some Welsh districts including theirs, threatened their much-need break (they had been shielding and with mental ill-health in the family, getting away to a favourite place was very important to them).  Although technically against advice not to travel out of their area which was imminently due to be in local lockdown, into another (not at that time in local lockdown) so close to the cut-off day, they were able to extend their booking and did travel there before the lockdown officially came in.   The Welsh restrictions impacted a little on me and J & T too, as we planned to travel up to visit family graves to mark birthdays.  The cemetery was not in a restricted area but visiting it would have meant travelling through a restricted area on the motorway unless we took a long detour.  Although not prohibited, this was not being encouraged and we felt it was not an essential journey.  Had we gone the previous week, it wouldn’t have been a problem.  A few days after our proposed visit, the town in which the cemetery is located, also went into local lockdown. The timing of number restrictions on social gatherings such as weddings that may have been planned for a while, has impacted hugely on people and I feel very sorry for them.  It does seem harsh if your chosen date just happened to be after the regulation that reduced receptions from 30,  when people mix in far higher  M7145 numbers in restaurants etc.  I do understand that it is socialising closely is high risk, and self-distancing is likely to be harder in a wedding environment with friends and relatives meeting after perhaps long separation.  And some of those may have travelled distances across the UK if not further, so that again is an increased risk.  But how on earth does one decide who now can and can’t be at one’s wedding when they’ve already been invited?  It must be an awful situation to be in, let alone a financial disaster. The things I have been doing since lockdown such as clearing cupboards have brought the passage of time in a longer scale, more clearly to mind.  Sorting our photos, seeing pictures of people who have since died, looking at oneself as a child or in one’s first job.  It makes one think about all the decades gone by and really brings the transience of time home to you.   In the beginning, because everything about this situation was novel and changing, every day was significant, and counting off the days since I had last been out and about normally, seemed to stretch the weeks.  I am still staying largely at home, but as the pandemic has become the ‘new normal’ – irritating phrase, but an accurate one – that novelty has worn off.  The days and weeks seem to be rushing by, and the shortening daylight perhaps contributing to this. Over the summer I have been glad to have activities to spend time doing, such as sewing masks by hand, while watching TV at the same time. I don’t feel so guilty about doing that during the day.  Old habits die hard, even though I have the time to do it.  I’ve also resumed a tapestry, many years since I first started it.  I have time to practise my guitar more, but that is one activity that I still find difficult to sustain for more than an hour or so.   The pandemic has changed some of the timings of my usual domestic habits.  For example in the early days especially, I was washing clothes on higher temperatures than before, which meant a longer washing time than usual.  However I no longer have to time the cycle to end so I can hang washing out before going out to my voluntary work, so the weather is really the only restraint.  Washing of hands of course takes longer these days than previously, when I would wash fairly quickly unless cooking.  I have always had a good store cupboard and would time my shopping to restock only when almost out of an item.  As reports of panic buying circulated, I was very conscious of working out how long my existing supplies of groceries, loo roll, etc would last me.  Having the ability to calculate quantities of shampoo, portions of frozen vegetables, tins of beans, has never been so useful.   It took me nearly a month to get click and collect supermarket slots and I now do one fortnightly.  The timing of my shopping now is more critical than it was when I had the option of just popping out to buy something.  I still have that option, but don’t use it.  So I work out the best time to collect, mainly taking into account the timing of the pick (you can’t order instore bakery before a certain time and a Monday pick may mean there is less choice and more substitution).  The time of the slot doesn’t matter to me otherwise as I have very few other commitments in my week.  I choose a date within a day or two of the previous pick, a fortnight earlier, which helps to ensure I am less likely to run out of a particular item, especially fresh ones.   The pandemic has deepened my feeling of life being on hold.  When my husband died, I felt everything had stopped.  I purposely set out to do voluntary work in an attempt to start up again and feel useful.  Although I found enjoyment and friendship in that, underlying it all has been the feeling that moving forward in life, ticking off the days, weeks and months, has less meaning than it did before.  The seasons still roll around, but I don’t have a holiday to plan and look forward to, as we used to do as a couple in Spring or Autumn.  Christmas is spent with J&T which is very nice, but not the same as being able to plan tree decoration, buying presents and attending events, with my husband.  The years used to go by, with house moves, job changes,  M7145 work and activities shared, but now they seem to stretch ahead with little focus.  That feeling has been exaggerated by the pandemic.   I do hope that life will become more normal in the next year or two (I can’t see much changing before 2022).  When that happens I will resume other activities and be happy that other people and the economy, will hopefully be liberated from the constraints and worries we are currently living in.  Whether I will again find a real focus in time, who knows. Despite knowing that ‘time’ as human beings know it, is measured in fixed increments, I find it interesting that how I spend my time and what is happening to me at any one time, can sometimes have the effect of stretching or compressing those increments.  Something humans are all too aware of, when wanting a dental appointment to be over, or wanting Christmas to last all year.  My parents were in their late thirties/early forties getting married and having a family and I remember being often told that ‘you’ll never be this young again’ and ‘make the most of every moment’.  Since I can remember, I’ve been aware that life is short, and tried to follow their advice.  I am trying to do that, but how successfully, time will tell."

Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? In early March I received the letter notifying me that I was eligible to make an appointment for my first dose of vaccine and giving me instructions on how to do so. My wife had had her first injection a few weeks previously, at a local health centre, so I was disappointed, on logging on to the NHS website, to find that I had a choice between two â€˜Nightingaleâ€™ vaccination centres, one a couple of miles away and the other down in Durham. Iâ€™d heard horror stories about the difficulty of getting to the local Nightingale by road, the entire area itâ€™s in being one enormous roadworks at present, but reluctantly I booked an appointment there. But then my own GPâ€™s surgery got in touch -this seems to be a feature of the vaccination drive, that surgeries and health centres (and presumably the Nightingales) actively hunt down the as yet unvaccinated and tout for their business, so to speak Â­and offered me a morning slot the very next day, Thursday 11 March. I was much relieved, I can tell you. So the next day I drove over to the Cleadon Park Health Centre. This is a very new, modern facility spread over several floors, very spacious and easily adapted for mass vaccinations. I gave my name at the temporary reception desk in the entrance foyer, was ticked off against the computer-printed list of booked appointments and ordered to take the stairs up to the waiting area. There I was met by a â€˜marshalâ€™ -a lady I know personally, to our mutual surprise and delight -and would have had to wait before being called into the room where the vaccinations were being given, but the queue was moving so quickly I never even got the chance to sit down. Along a corridor and sent by another marshal into a large room divided with screens into four or five â€˜podsâ€™. I had my name checked off again and after a short wait -barely five minutes -I was called into a pod. The nurse ran through a short checklist -the usual any allergies?, are you on any medication? questions, as I recall -then told me Iâ€™d be getting the AstraZenica vaccine and got on with it. Wait for fifteen minutes before driving, off you go. Down a different set of stairs and back to the foyer to be ticked off one last time, and I was back in the car park. Overall, Iâ€™d say the atmosphere in the building was positive and almost jolly: you just didnâ€™t get any chance to sit and brood over where you were and what had brought you there. Which vaccine did you receive? The AstraZenica (â€˜Oxfordâ€™) vaccine. How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? Later that day, after Iâ€™d gone home and had been for a walk, I wrote the following entry in the diary I keep for MO: â€˜For an hour or so after I got home I felt â€˜differentâ€™, but couldnâ€™t be very specific about how different -temperature definitely up a little, slight wooziness followed by an episode of what I can only describe as elation. But that passed, and my brisk mile and a half walk hasnâ€™t stressed me out so fingers crossed I may have avoided any serious unpleasantness. The left arm is very slightly stiff but Iâ€™m sure I could manage a spot of guitar playing without collapsing in agony. Hey ho.â€™ Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon But not long afterwardsâ€¦ â€˜Resuming after a brief and unsuccessful attempt at playing the guitar. Oddly, my upper left arm, where the needle went in, is fine, but my forearm and wrist are both more than a little sore and itâ€™s hard to form and hold down a chord. I might as well flop out with a bookâ€¦.â€™ Two days later I wrote: â€˜While I couldnâ€™t point to any one thing and declare it to be a distinct side-effect of the vaccine, nonetheless I was really not myself at all for most of yesterday. Obviously my body was processing the vaccine and rearranging its internal biochemistry, rather as my computer has to do during one of its periodic operating system updates, and I just had to go along for the ride. Lethargy and a mild headache were the worst of it, and although I made myself linguini with king prawns, olive oil, garlic and chillies for dinner I canâ€™t say I had much appetite. I went to bed at half past nine and put Radio 3 on to keep me company, and slept through till seven. My left arm is completely back to normal now, no ache or stiffness, so I can get back to the guitar, and Iâ€™ve already been for a fast walk to liven myself up. Iâ€™m recording this mostly by way of a comparison with other peopleâ€™s experience: to my knowledge most people whoâ€™ve had the AstraZeneca (â€˜Oxfordâ€™) vaccine have had only mild reactions, but a few have been made quite ill, albeit for only a day or so, while the Pfizer vaccine seems not to cause any noticeable upsets. A month or so back, when I was collecting Lâ€™s prescription the pharmacist told me that half of their staff had had the Oxford vaccine and the other half the Pfizer, all on the same day, and the Pfizer recipients were all fine but the Oxford people were laid up with chills and severe headaches. [A friend, undergoing chemotherapy] was ill for three days, but then his immune system is completely shot. I suspect itâ€™s all a bit of a lottery really, and Iâ€™m not inclined to complain anyway because the way my body reacted shows that thereâ€™s something in the vaccine worth reacting to. Roll on the second jab.â€™ Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of Covid-19? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? Yes, Iâ€™m still wearing a mask and sloshing the hand sanitiser around and observing social distancing when Iâ€™m out and about. I wonâ€™t be at all surprised if weâ€™re still following these practices into next year. As regards the timescale for lifting restrictions: I think itâ€™s generally admitted now that last year we moved to lift the lockdown too quickly, so this time we really do need to proceed cautiously. Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™ve had an easy pandemic, so far: thatâ€™s to say, I havenâ€™t found myself unemployed, or furloughed from my job, and I havenâ€™t lost anyone to Covid-19, and Iâ€™ve kept myself occupied. I know people who are having a much harder time of it, and others who, while theyâ€™re financially secure, are going mad because they canâ€™t travel abroad for holidays or to visit far-flung relatives. But short-term pain is preferable to letting the virus mutate yet again and dragging out lockdowns and restrictions across another year. Iâ€™ll just take whatever comes and be as patient about it as I can. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine? If so, what worries you? Not in the slightest. If anything worries me itâ€™s the vaccine refuseniks and the conspiracy nutters who fuel their doubts and fears. And donâ€™t get me started on that merde-brain Macron. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any thoughts on the rollout of the vaccine programme (e.g. priority groups, plans to vaccinate key workers). Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon I canâ€™t speak for Scotland, but in England and Wales the vaccine programme seems to have been deliberately designed to roll out as quickly as possible, through a blend of what I might call state provision -setting up vaccination centres, arranging vaccine supplies and issuing invitations through the NHS register -and â€˜private enterpriseâ€™, by which I mean individual Health Centres and clinics contacting patients on their rolls directly and filling as many slots as possible in any given day. Thatâ€™s what happened when my wife was vaccinated in February and again when I was vaccinated a month later. From what Iâ€™ve seen and been told this seems to have worked very efficiently, so thatâ€¦whatâ€™s the word for us? Vaccinatees?â€¦feel that theyâ€™re being processed through a calm, smoothly-working machine. As for the staging of the rollout: I think Iâ€™d have been inclined to vaccinate shop workers and teachers comparatively early on, just after key medical workers and high risk vulnerable groups, but overall it struck me as reasonable. A friendâ€™s wife was vaccinated weeks earlier than her general age group because sheâ€™s listed as a carer for her autistic son, and again, I have no problem with that. In fact Iâ€™ve heard no complaints at all, from any quarter, about the pace or the staging of the vaccination programme. From initial procurement through to final delivery itâ€™s been a success story, and has gone a long way towards raising morale: people now see an end to restrictions and the return of normal life. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. Mostly from the Times, with additional information from the Radio 4 evening news. I wouldnâ€™t say that Iâ€™d been following the development of the various vaccines with any great attention, though, not least because I hadnâ€™t realised how quickly the various laboratories would gear up and start work, and wasnâ€™t expecting even an experimental vaccine to appear beforeâ€¦well, around now in fact (April 2021). This might be a good place to record that Iâ€™ve long since stopped reading news reports about the progress of the pandemic and the economic, political and economic consequences arising from it. I simply turn past the relevant pages in the Times and I tune out almost all the radio news coverage (because I do all the cooking and much of the housework I never get to see the dinner-time TV news). Thereâ€™s nothing much I can do to influence whatâ€™s happening, Iâ€™m not privy to any of the high-level briefings, and I long ago lost interest in speculative articles about where the virus came from, how it might develop and so on. The only recent stories Iâ€™ve followed with anything like interest have been the EUâ€™s attempt to browbeat the UK over supplies of the AstraZenica vaccine and, following on from that, the various contradictory statements about said vaccine emanating from Van Der Leyen, Macron, Merkel and other assorted Europillocks. Sighâ€¦that I should write anything so crudely dismissive of senior EU figures; after all, I voted Remain in the referendum. But thereâ€™s no denying that, for reasons clearly rooted in its â€˜command structureâ€™, the EU Commission has made a hash of handling the pandemic, failed fatally badly when it comes to putting in place a vaccination programme, and managed to offend a great many of its erstwhile defenders here in the UK. Iâ€™m not aware that thereâ€™s as yet any concerted â€˜Brejoinâ€™ movement here but if there is one itâ€™ll have taken a knock. I couldnâ€™t believe the nonsense Macron was coming out with, and Van Der Leyenâ€™s attitude seemed to come down to, â€˜How dare you refuse to give us supplies of your ineffective, harmful vaccine?!â€™ What a double act theyâ€™ve been. Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon Making vaccines mandatory Please share thoughts on â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™: used to allow travel abroad, or to pubs and sports stadiums in the UK. Iâ€™m not opposed to the principle of limiting access to travel, venues and so on to those who can prove that theyâ€™ve been vaccinated, but Iâ€™m wary of setting up a whole new bureaucracy to deliver and police the passporting process; also, I bet any such passports would be easily forged. The key to opening u travel and public concerts and event sis the rapid, comprehensive roll-out of the vaccination programme. Iâ€™d be inclined to focus on that, and relax restrictions as quickly as possible thereafter. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t, be mandatory? Iâ€™m from a generation that had all the so-called normal childhood diseases, from whooping cough through measles, mumps, chickenpox and German measles; I think the only vaccine we were routinely given was against polio. And speaking as someone who had those diseases I find it annoying when I read about parents denying their children the now readily available vaccines against them. Measles in particular is a most unpleasant disease -I had to be quarantined while I had it, and have never felt worse in my entire life. Children can die from measles. I can see a case for making a standard suite of childhood vaccinations mandatory. Itâ€™s not as though we make such a fuss about the vaccinations we might need to get in adult life: yellow fever and the like. Moving on from that, itâ€™s not wholly unreasonable to make the Covid-19 vaccination compulsory for all people not exempted on health grounds. Unvaccinated people are more likely to contract the disease and therefore more likely to spread it. Possibly the government is hanging back from taking that final step because for the past fourteen months itâ€™s been depending on public tolerance and goodwill to hold society and the economy together while the vaccines were developed, and has developed a sense for just how far people can be pushed before their frustrations boil over. It may also have calculated -quite correctly, it seems -that most people are very keen indeed to be vaccinated, while those who vociferously oppose vaccination are widely regarded as tinfoil hat nutters (if theyâ€™re white) or religious nutters (if theyâ€™re Muslims) or just plain dumbasses (all other ethnic minority groups). In other words, just ignore the refuseniks and in time most of them will sheepishly turn up at their local Health Centres."

(e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive the vaccine. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? I will get vaccinated. I have no time or patience for anti-vaxxers with their little tinfoil hats and their nutty theories about microchips and 5G and government surveillance. You know how we know that vaccines work? Anti-vaxxers havenâ€™t succumbed to smallpox. Anti-vaxxers havenâ€™t succumbed to polio. Anti-vaxxers havenâ€™t succumbed to diptheria, or been rendered sterile by adult mumps. Theyâ€™ve been lucky that the only thing theyâ€™ve caused an outbreak of in recent years has been measles. I canâ€™t lie that I am a bitanxious about the prospect of being given the Astra-Zeneca vaccine now thattheyâ€™ve flagged up that it is causing blood clots. I have bad circulation and varicose veins, and if possible, then I would want to request the Pfizer or an alternative rather than a vaccine thatâ€™s currently causing clotting. However, Iâ€™m not in a priority category, so itâ€™s likely that Iwonâ€™t be vaccinated until late summer/fall at the earliest â€“ it might be a case of getting whatever is available at that point in time. Itâ€™s not been made clear as to whether weâ€™ll be told in advance at the point of being invited what type of vaccine weâ€™ll receive. Iâ€™m hoping that I can find this out when Iâ€™m invited and/or possibly reschedule if there are still concerns about Astra-Zeneca and if thatâ€™s the one Iâ€™m offered. Iâ€™d ultimately rather be vaccinated than not though. I do also think that we donâ€™t know what any potential long-term effects of the RNA/protein method rather than a traditional live vaccine are, but given that theyâ€™ve identified issues with Astra-Zeneca relatively quickly after rolling it out, I would hope that theyâ€™re also monitoring any similar concerns with the other vaccines. I am also slightly anxious about vaccine scarcity, but ultimately, in a worst case scenario, I then think that it would likely just take more time to be vaccinated if we have to wait for more vaccines to be produced â€“thereâ€™s nothing I can individually do about that, so thereâ€™s no point getting stressed about it at this point in time. I plan to follow the guidelines as I have been doing since last March â€“ Scotland is currently loosening restrictions, but I think Iâ€™ll wait to see if theyâ€™ll continue loosening these, or if it looks like infection may go up again before I dive right into travelling locally or going round the shops/into crowds of people. I think thereâ€™s some uncertainty as to whether the vaccines will be fully suitable for all of the identified variants, so may as well be safe rather than sorry in the meantime while the rollout is still ongoing. Iâ€™m trying to be optimistic about the timeframe for lockdown easing and things going back to â€˜normalâ€™, but seeing whatâ€™s happening in Ontario where my parents live, where they opened everything up only for cases to skyrocket, do make me wonder if weâ€™re going to start opening up, and then have to roll everything right back again. Iâ€™m definitely beginning to lose patience with relatively affluent and financially secure friends and co-workers who are talking endlessly about the impact lockdown is having on their mental health and their difficulty juggling a secure and flexible job with childcare responsibilities. Like, sorry, you are not someone who is having to cope with Covid-19 while being a garbage picker in the slums of Bangladesh, or living in a 15 x 7 coffin room in Hong Kong. Get some perspective and possibly also some inner resources. (This is uncharitable of me. Everyone deals with this situation in their own way and everyone has different capabilities when it comes to resilience. But still. My patience this year has been much more finite than usual.) The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. At the moment, the vaccine programme in Scotland does seem to be rolling out relatively straightforwardlyâ€¦.? Man, I hope I donâ€™t jinx it now! The definition of their priority groups all makes sense to me. My NHS surgery started out by vaccinating priority groups, but when the priority groups start tailing off, vaccination will then transfer over to the bigger NHS Health Boards and larger vaccination sites, according to the NHS webpages. I think that quite a lot of the information on the Scottish government webpages and in briefings, and on Scottish NHS website are all pretty clear and transparent, with the exception of when/how youâ€™ll find out what vaccine youâ€™ll get. (And itâ€™s possiblethatitis there and Iâ€™ve just missed it.) In addition to the government and NHS webpages, Iâ€™ve been keeping an eye on the news sources I normally read and trust (the BBC and the Guardian) for any articles about the vaccines and potential side effects. Iâ€™m not regularly following vaccination programming updates though; I find itâ€™shard enough keeping on top of changes to lockdown restrictions without also trying to remember how many people have received a first vaccination dosage. The wrangling of second dosages seems to have been a bit more thorny though, with misinformation and/or conflicting advice being given about whether the second dosage must be the same type as the first, what the timing for receiving the second dosage should be etc. I feel like I havenâ€™t done enough research into this aspect to be able to wrap my head around it â€“I figured Iâ€™d have time to do it before my vaccination number comes up thoughâ€¦ Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? My feeling is that when it comes to â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™, we canâ€™t have a one size fits all approach. I think that there is a good case and precedent for requiring evidence of vaccination and/or clear medical exemption in the long run for international travel. Countries around the world have previously required evidence of other vaccination records for country-specific epidemic concerns (yellow fever, bubonic plague) and/or similar medical evidence (scans showing that your lungs are clear of TB) to receive a visa and enter the country. I donâ€™t see why we wouldnâ€™t require the same for Covid-19 given that itâ€™sa global pandemic â€“a country by country/â€™hot spotâ€™ approach would likely be the most appropriate with each country determining its own entry requirements and whether they were requiring vaccination evidence however, rather than a one size fits all. That said, I donâ€™t think you canâ€™t make vaccinations 100% mandatory because: a) how do you then manage successful visa application, travel provision, and immigration clearance for those who are immune-compromised, or who are travelling to receive specialised medical treatment, or who cannot receive a vaccination due to a pre-existing health condition or other medical reason. b) how do you ensure that insurance providers will then cover travellers who cannot receive a vaccine due to legitimate medical exemption. c) What happens when we reach a point where the worldâ€™s wealthier countries may be primarily vaccinated while poorer regions may not be â€“ having vaccination as an entry requirement will impact on global inequality for regions where the vaccine roll-out is problematic/non-existent. d) What might the knock-on effects be, and is mandatory the same as legal? How do you ensure that countries donâ€™t mis-use this power in terms of permitting visitors to enter and/or leave â€“ what happens to a traveller, for example, who is medically exempt, enters the UK without a hitch through one airport,  but who is then prevented from leaving by individual immigration officials or travel providers at a different airport expecting to see evidence of vaccination and not recognising exempt documentation. What happens if that delay then causes a traveller to overstay their visa and/or are they in the UK illegally? Similarly, what happens to a dual citizen who has been residing abroad, wants to return to the UK, but who has not been able to receive a vaccine in the country they have been temporarily residing in, despite wishing to receive one â€“ will quarantine still be an option? I do feel personally strongly that international travellers should have to provide legitimate proof of exemption, and this should be on medical grounds â€“ those who have no medical rationale for exemption, and who just choose not to get vaccinated are free to make that choice, and can change their mind and request vaccination if they do decide to travel at some point. That said, I can foresee problems with legitimate medical exemption as well. Countries would have to have a clear itemised list as to what documentation they would require for visa purposes and at immigration clearance. Travel providers would also have to provide clarity on this. And I very much appreciate that people may not feel comfortable feeling that they have to declare a sensitive medical condition/proof of exemption, and/or may feel discriminated against having to declare information repeatedly and/or having it be questioned, and/or may be penalised if they are not believed. That said, having to declare a vaccine also entails declaring your personal medical history, soâ€¦ So â€“ on the fence for vaccine requirements for international travel. Personally, I strongly feel that it should be required on a country by country basis in the way that other vaccinations may be, and/or legitimate exemption evidence should be required otherwise, but thatâ€™s a gut feeling. When I try to look at it rationally, I can definitely start picking this approach apart. I donâ€™t believe in local vaccine passports. I 100% think that any attempt to introduce these will be misguided, have genuine concerns about civil liberties and state surveillance and police power, and that these will result in substantial exclusion in daily life for the non-vaccinated. Also that the vast majority of the British public canâ€™t be trusted not to accidentally leave their passports in the pub."

My surgery wasbooked for a Monday morning so I was phoned the previous Wednesday and an appointment made for me to have the test on the Friday morning.I had to go to the drive-through testing area at the hospital, which turned out to be a loading bay at the rear of the hospital with a one-way entrance and exit road. I mentioned at my pre-op that we didn't have a car and what should I do if I couldn't get a lift. The nurse looked baffled and said I'd have to go in a car because there were no other options and that if I couldn't get a lift I'd have to get a taxi. As I was shielding at the time, I certainly wouldn't have liked the taxi, but a friend agreed to take me for the test (and in for the surgery, and home afterwards, thank goodness).There was quite a queue of cars when we arrived so it took about 10 minutes to get to the front. We had to reverse into the loading bay where there were two nurses in full PPE, one to check my details and the other to do the test. She swabbed the back of my throat at both sides, then up both nostrils. It wasn't pleasant (wanting to gag then wanting to sneeze) but I never expected it would be. I was told that I wouldn't be informed if the test was negative (actually, I was informed by email later that day, that the test was negative), then we drove back because I had to go straight home and self isolate (along with B, my husband) for the weekend. This seemed a bit odd as B hadn't been tested. We'd planned our food, etc, for the weekend in advance, and didn't go out anywhere except into the garden.Everyday TestingI've only had three lateral flow tests, all associated with having surgery. The first was the one above, the second the same for a minor follow up procedure, and the third because the second test was 'spoiled' and I had to go in and repeat the whole thing a day later.The first was in early March 2021and the other two in early June. By March, our hospital had come down from its high alert phase (when there were green, amber and red areas depending on Covid risk, and different entrances and exits for these areas) to a more normal way of working, albeit with tests, masks and sanitiser in use.Who benefitted? I did, plus the entire hospital - staff and patients. I didn't want to get Covid and I didn't want to introduce it into the hospital either. And I wouldn't hesitate to get tested if it was necessary.MO J7420 - Summer 2021- C19 TestingI haven't up to now had LF tests in the house but I have just sent off for some - I'd like to have some in now that we're starting to see friends again. One or two of them have health problems and it might be better not to take the risk.Other diagnostic tests? I did a shop bought cholesterol test years ago - obviously, stabbing your finger, even if it is quick and automatic, isn't nice. And I do those age-related bowel screening tests that are posted out to me. Those are easy and convenient and not unpleasant at all.Views on testingThe Test and Trace programme is a bit of a closed book to me and B because neither of us have a smartphone. So whenever there's a Q code to scan, we have to leave our contact details instead and presumably, someone would phone us if necessary. Actually, we've been to a few places where we haven't been asked for our contact details - I think everyone assumes that you have got a smartphone these days.T&T sounds to have cost an absolute fortune to set up and run so I don't know if the cost of it is, or will be, deemed to be worth it. The whole pingdemic thing seems to have got out of control and if people are turning off the app because they don't want to be pinged, how effective does that make the programme? And surely doing lateral flow tests is better than enforced isolation for people who may be uninfected. Anyway, it appears that the vast amount of pinging has had a backlash, as so many occupations have now been granted ping-immunity. T&T seems like a bit of a fiasco, really.Accuracy of testing - I'm not too concerned about this. I wouldn't expect any test to be 100% accurate and it sounds as if these tests are accurate enough to make them worthwhile."

My husband B, was done later, in March & June (I'm classed as clinically vulnerable.) We both went to the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate - one of their huge exhibition halls has been converted into a vaccination centre. The hall was at the furthest point of the Showground site (itself a huge area}, so my choice was either to get the bus into Harrogate (we don't have a car), then get the free shuttle bus out to the centre, then do it all in reverse, ie: use four buses, or beg a lift from a friend. As I was still shielding, I wasn't keen on the four-bus option but fortunately, a friend was willing to take me out there. B chose to walk there and back- a journey of an hour and ten minutes each way.I was very impressed with the efficiency of the centre - hardly any queuing, a fast moving line round a one-way system, plenty of volunteers, a quick computer check-in, a short wait on a chair then on to a cubicle with another computer operator and a nurse who was moving from one cubicle to another.I got the Astra Zeneca vaccine both times - the blood clot business only surfaced after my first shot but it didn't worry me too much - and I just felt a bit rough the day after: tired and headachy with a slightly sore arm.I am still wearing a mask in indoor public places and I'm still trying to do social distancing, although it's more difficult now that other people seem to have relaxed their distancing quite a bit. It's easier just not to put yourself in certain situations - I don't go in too many shops and we still haven't been inside a pub or cafe, though outside feels OK. We did have a few days away in a holiday cottage in the Yorkshire Dales once we'd both been double-jabbed and were a bit shocked by how busy everywhere was. It did affect our choices about what to do, but we mostly wanted to go for walks and sit outside to eat so that was alright.It's been difficult to keep up with government guidelines and restrictions as they change so often. I just groan when some new announcement takes place. An awful lot of it seems to be to do with holidays abroad so, as I'm not even considering this, I can just ignore all the green/amber/red zone stuff. I don't have much sympathy with people who've optimistically booked foreign holidays, then start complaining when the guidelines change and they're in trouble. It's not a human right to have an annual holiday abroad, it's a luxury. I do however feel for partners and family members who've been separated and who desperately want to meet up again. It would be nice if there were a different category for them - the deserving travellers?- but I can't see how this could be achieved.MO: J7420 - Spring 2021- C19 vaccineBoris Johnson's behaviour still appals me. He's only comfortable with being the Man of the People­ travelling the country, popping up in workplaces to pretend to make rivets or bread, hair all mussed up - then the poor lamb has to act all serious for another crushing announcement - something he clearly doesn't want to do at all. A buffoonish performer for the cameras is absolutely what we don't need in a time of crisis... but we've got one!I'm as concerned about the safety of the vaccine as I would be on reading the leaflet inside a packet of new medication which I had to take, or on signing a hospital consent form where one of the outcomes is 'you may die.' You know about all those possible side effects but it's a question of weighing the smaller risks against that larger benefits. I was longing to get the vaccine and I feel so much safer having had it.The vaccine programmeIt does seem as if the vaccine programme in my area has been rolled out as it should - all groups being offered it in the right order as far as I'm aware. I was contacted by text, round about the date I was expecting, and made the appointments online with no problems. B, who doesn't have a mobile phone, was contacted by phone, by our GP. When he had to change the date, he rang the GP and it was easily sorted out.I've had my info about the vaccine from the i newspaper and from the BBC (TV news, Radio 4 & website). The vaccine has had a Jot of publicity so it's been hard to miss it. Misinformation and the anti-vaxxers have had a lot of publicity too. I realise that some people are genuinely worried about having the vaccine - there's a difference between the medication leaflet/hospital consent forms which I mentioned and having the vaccine, because the first are about treating a condition which you already have and which you want to be fixed, while vaccines are a preventative measure for something which you might never get. But the personal anguish of these people isn't helped by the nutjob end of the anti-vaxx spectrum who clog up social media with their bizarre theories. Even if there are relatively few of them, they make an awful lot of noise while shouting out their dangerous views.Making vaccines mandatoryAt first thought, vaccine passports seem like a sensible idea, whether for foreign travel or for access to certain public places, but they do rather smack of something that might be enforced in a police state. And it might lead to a 2-tier society within which there would be a lot of unrest and resentment. And vaccine passports could surely be forged - a lucrative business? I certainly carry my 'double-jabbed' card with me whenever I go anywhere, but it's a tricky question with no easy answers.I don't think any vaccinations should be mandatory. You can't force people to have medical interventions. How would that work? Strapping people down as they fight having the injection? No. Again, it smacks of governments who've carried out enforced sterilizations on particular groups of people."

I had received the invite by text message from my GP, a service that they already use to provide appointments booking, advice etc. The online booking process was very straight forward and the date offered was within a few days. I had been invited to have the vaccine early as I have (mild) asthma so had been prioritised and they were administering the Pfizer vaccine on that day. Although I had been aware on some reluctance from parts of the community for various reasons (all of which I believe to be unfounded â€“ microchip implants conspiracists to side effect worries), I was really happy to receive mine. It really felt like the beginning of a step towards a future where we could begin to engage with each other again, to socialise without fear. I work quite close to my GP surgery, so I was able to travel by car from work. My employers were more than happy to allow me time out of work to do this. The vaccine delivery was like a military operation, albeit with a more upbeat feel to it. From queuing to enter, being directed to sanitizing stations, personal detail checks, the â€˜jabâ€™ itself (as everyone refers to it), the fifteen minute wait in the marquee outside to the time check and release was brilliant. There was certainly a feeling of positivity and as usual the NHS staff were professional with a personal touch throughout. I was given my second date before leaving. I experienced very mild tenderness to my upper arm the following day but otherwise I felt well and had no other effects from my vaccination. Three other friends were vaccinated the same day and speaking to them and colleagues it was the general consensus that their experience had been the same. Everyone praised the efficiency of the staff involved, from the larger vaccination centres to the smaller surgeries alike. I received my second dose on Wednesday 12th May 2021. This had been changed from the original date due to the delivery schedule of the Pfizer but was actually brought forward by two days. Again, this had been done by text message from my surgery with a link to click on the booking site and was really simple to arrange. The experience was much the same except the highlight was a rather comical chap in the waiting area afterwards. He was in his forties at a guess (mask make this harder to judge) and walked with a stick. On entering the marquee he was advised that there were no seats available but one would come free in a minute as everyone had to wait fifteen minutes and had been given the time they could leave written on a slip of paper. A staff member was F7368 calling out the time every minute and a batch of people would leave. Immediately someone stood up and offered their seat saying, â€˜itâ€™s ok Iâ€™m going on the next minuteâ€™. The chap replied theatrically, speaking to the room, his audience â€˜Ah thank you, thank you youâ€™ve restored my faith in humanityâ€™, to which he received a small titter of laughter from the crowd. As soon as he sat down, the next minute was called â€˜10.42â€™â€¦ â€˜Is it Bingo?â€™ he piped up, more laughing. â€˜10.43â€™â€¦ â€˜HOUSE!â€™ he cried. The room erupted. A couple minutes without incident passed before his next one liner â€˜Is anyone in here medically trained?â€™ The staff member by the door looked up worriedly â€˜Yes S is a nurse, are you feeling unwell?â€™, â€˜No Iâ€™m fine!â€™. â€™10.51â€™â€™, â€˜Thatâ€™s me!â€™. As he stood up to leave, won over by the lightness he had brought to the room, he got a little cheer. Although it doesnâ€™t sound particularly funny on paper, it really summed up both the positivity in the room, the way the British handle awkward situations like sitting in a room full of strangers and the way you are collectively complicit in jocularity when youâ€™re in the presence of a joker. Following this second dose my arm wasnâ€™t really sore but I felt really tired for a couple of days. It was an inconvenience, nothing more. As a child I received a range of inoculations, Polio in a sugar lump at Primary School being the first I remember after my ones in infancy. The last being the Rubella in my teens. It was like a rite of passage, who would get a big scar? They were and are part of life. The reason people donâ€™t die of TB anymore is because we are immunised. (Although I am aware of rising cases in recent years â€“ when I worked at a university there was a case in the halls of residence and we had to notify the other students in the shared accommodation). Over the years there have been pandemics and diseases such as cancer that we are all focused on eradicating or treating with the latest medical advances. In my opinion, Covid-19 is just another one. The fact that a vaccine has been developed in such a short space of time is testament to the amazing scientist all working to a common cause and I felt incredibly proud to be one of the many to receive it. I have a Facebook acquaintance, a fellow boater who I have chatted to on and off over the last few years -not a friend as such, who has been the only really vocal â€˜anti-vaxâ€™ exponent. Some of the stuff shared on her social media I find laughable, but it is slightly worrying that there is an element who really believe that vaccines are somehow about Government control. These people are free to deny their own children a range of vaccines that could potentially have life changing consequences for them. Iâ€™m sure the first thing they would do, if they were ill, would be to see a doctor and wouldnâ€™t say no to surgery if they had appendicitis! Iâ€™m not sure how you could win round such strong opinions, education is probably the best weapon. Although I have now had both doses of the vaccine, I am still complying with the CovidÂ­19 guidelines. I did go to visit my friend, who I hadnâ€™t seen for over a year but we both did one of the lateral flow tests that are available free online beforehand, and we still sat outside. She had a heart attack prior to the pandemic and was shielding last year so I still felt cautious. It was so good to see her! The one thing I have felt much happier about is being at work. Apart from 9 weeks where I worked from home at the beginning of the F7368 first lockdown, I have worked in a busy office where compliance with mask wearing and social distancing was very poor. I certainly feel much less stressed about this environment now Iâ€™ve had both â€˜jabsâ€™. One thing to not is the usage of the word â€˜jabâ€™ â€“ I know it isnâ€™t a new reference to having a vaccination or any injection but it has now become ingrained in our day to day language with the Prime Minister even using this in his briefings. Along with â€˜lockdownâ€™ and â€˜social distancingâ€™, â€˜jabâ€™ is another word that has seeped into our everyday conversations, unused little over a year ago. Iâ€™m happy to wait until restrictions can be lifted safely before travelling abroad resumes, we donâ€™t have many holidays abroad as we live on a narrowboat so we tend to holiday in this country on our boat. We do like to go to France in our campervan though and that will probably be the first holiday we will have abroad but not until next year at the earliest, mainly because we have planned all our holidays already this year rather than to do with restrictions. We are going to Devon in August in our camper and having a canal holiday in the autumn, location, as yet, not decided. One of my bosses tried to go to Spain a couple of week ago, before restrictions were lifted, as he has an apartment there. He seemed to think he was above the law and because there were flights available he took that as a green light to go. He was turned away at the airport after being advised that Spain was only accepting residents. I think, we have been waiting over a year, whatâ€™s a little more time? If there is a vaccination passport scheme introduced, I will be happy with that. I think we have a responsibility to each other and if you want to put yourself at risk, then you should do that without affecting others."

My initial reflection is that (Global Pandemic aside)  after having had the opportunity to live a different and better life, where I had time to spend on the things I enjoy, I am back to the clichés of the daily grind, chasing my tail and feeling there aren’t enough hours in the day. I have worked all through the lockdown but spent almost 9 weeks at the start working from home (which in my case is a narrowboat). This period afforded me a glimpse of how a different approach to working meant that I had more free time, no commute, more productivity and much, much lower stress levels. My husband works nights most of the time so we suddenly could spend the afternoons together. I felt more like a real couple sharing a life together rather than grabbing a day or so a week to do everything and being frustrated at being on my own so much.  Adapting to home working was easy. Our narrowboat has a little back cabin which echoes the traditional working boats living compartments and is as such a self sufficient area separate from the main living area. There is a bench seat, range stove and drop-down table. A family would have lived in this tiny space and it made a perfect temporary home office. I used my own laptop and within a couple of hours our IT support at work had set up a remote link to my work pc. My husband works for the same company, a haulage firm, he is a driver and so we were considered key workers. He would collect paperwork at the end of his night shift and bring it home and I would them process it the following day. Once a week I would call in the office to do some filing, tying it in with the weekly shop for my parents. I would get up at my normal time and go into the back cabin, leaving my husband asleep in bed. At the beginning in March it was still cold so I would light the fire and keep the kettle on the range during the day for an endless supply of tea. My husband would surface around lunchtime, so I would log off and we would eat brunch together. Then we would have a few hours together to walk, cycle, clean, play guitar, walk to the farm for fresh eggs, eat again and then he would leave for his nightshift. I would log back on and work until I had finished, sometimes this was until nine or ten in the evening but with less distraction I would sometimes be done much earlier. Unfortunately, my employers asked me to return even though it wasn’t affecting my performance and there had been no advice from the government to say to do so. However, they are a family business with an old fashioned approach, as in the ‘girls in the office’ should be exactly that. I requested a compromise of working from home part of the week but it was dismissed out of hand. I am now back in the office 5 days a week and although they have made some efforts to be Covid-19 secure (hand sanitizer stations) I do feel that I am much more at risk due to the busy nature of the office. I am commuting 1.5 hours a day and with the coming dark nights will have less opportunity to exercise outdoors in the evening. During lockdown, me and my husband started going on afternoon bike rides and walks. I am now seeing much less of him and have returned to shopping at the bigger supermarkets for convenience, whereas during the home working period I had the time during the day to shop at farm shops and walk to buy eggs and potatoes from the roadside in the village where we had moored our narrowboat. I feel that the work life balance improvements that the lockdown brought have been snatched away and my sense of well being is much reduced. Although I appreciate (with some guilt) that this better way of living and working was only as a result of this horrendous virus, it doesn’t lessen the negative impact that the ‘return to normal’ has meant for me. Thankfully, to date, I haven’t had any close friends or family affected by the virus, the nearest being my Father’s friend whose wife sadly died from Covid-19. They were unable to attend her funeral due to the restriction in place at the time, which was filmed by the crematorium staff so the family could have some closure.  Looking back at the way the lockdown changed my daily routine, it almost seemed that there wasn’t a huge change at all in some ways. I live on a narrowboat with my husband, we don’t have any kids. We don’t have a large extended family, just my parents. I have no siblings and my husband has a sister who we don’t really have much contact with. We only have a few close friends and only really one couple, D & R, who we see with any regularity. Being in lockdown didn’t have much impact on our relationships with these people. My parents were shielding and I was shopping for them once a week, when we would have a doorstep chat. I wouldn’t normally see them every week so in some ways I was spending time with them more often. We didn’t see D & R for a few weeks at the start but this was due to logistical reasons, they also live on a boat and we weren’t moored near them when movement was restricted. Leisure boaters were banned from moving their boats but ‘liveaboards’ were given permission to move for services like filling with water and toilet emptying. We chose to move near a Canal & River Trust services point a couple of weeks before lockdown was fully implemented as we knew it was coming and didn’t want to be left without access to essentials. Obviously it never came to that, but at the start no one really knew what was going to happen, so we planned for the worst. I haven’t really used any other types of media or technology than I did before to stay in touch with people or to do my work, which is relatively low tech anyway. Social media, messaging and phone calls were the way I kept in touch before and continued to do so, although I probably ‘checked in’ with a handful of friends a little more often for moral support. The place we chose to moor is a place we regularly stayed when we travelled off our permanent mooring. It is a lovely rural stretch of canal in West Lancashire that runs through flat agricultural farmland and terminates at a river lock. There are three boats permanently moored near the services and we knew one of the couples living aboard already. The boating community is like that, you meet people on your travels and are connected by your shared life on the canal.  In addition to the other boaters, there was also a woman living in her campervan on the Canal and River Trust services car park. We began to refer to her as the ‘Lady in the Van’ in reference to the true story written by Alan Bennett of a lady who parked her campervan on his drive for many years. We got chatting over the weeks that we were all hunkered down, and she told me her story. After selling her house in her mid-fifties to escape the rat race, she bought a camper to travel around Europe. A keen cyclist, she travelled alone, riding her bike in the most amazing places from France to Croatia. She would return to the UK in winter and rent a house for a few months before heading off in the spring. Unfortunately she had been forced to return to the UK when movement restriction came into force and she worried about becoming stuck somewhere with no support. She made it back to the UK but then had no means of getting accommodation (this was at the height of the lockdown and travel restrictions when motorhomes were being stopped by the police). Being local to the area she chose the Canal and River Trust services as she would have access to water, toilets and a shower. I and another boating couple did bits of shopping for her and we all supported each other. She stopped by one day with a flower and a poem for me that she had written about her experiences. I am still in touch with her now but she is no longer the  ‘Lady in the Van’, she is the ‘Lady in the Boat’, having swapped travels by road for a life on the canal, her experience of the boating community during the lockdown obviously had a great impact on her. At the time of writing it seems that we are likely to be put back under some more stricter local lockdown measures, living in the North West of England which is a current hot spot means it is inevitable and announcements are due to be made today in fact. It has become apparent that, although we have managed to have some kind of ‘normal’ life over the summer – we even managed a socially distanced camping holiday in Devon- life is different. I have gone from waiting for thing to ‘get back to normal’ to waiting for the ‘next restriction’. I am waiting for it get worse. I do tend to worry and I have a general feeling of ‘impending doom’ hanging over me. It is a weird juxtaposition of carrying on, going to work, buying food, cooking, cleaning, enjoying a sunny day, having a walk alongside rolling news, test and trace check-ins, daily counts, infection rates and death. I am living in my very own dystopian future."

No. W3163 Age: 63. Occupation: Retired. Location: St Gennys, Cornwall. Marital Status: Married Date: 24th June 2021 Subject: The Covid-19 Vaccine Iâ€™ve had both doses of the Astra Zeneca Covid-19 vaccine and had to go to Bodmin Treatment Centre for it. Thatâ€™s where our GP practice is sending all their patients and is a round trip of just over 40 miles. As I live in a rural area the only way to get there is to drive. A nurse administered it after going through a few questions and it took just a very few minutes from entering the building to leaving. As it was so quick itâ€™s hard to say anything about the atmosphere other than the receptionist and nurse were both cheerful and very pleasant. I didnâ€™t have any side effects from the jab, just a little tenderness at the site for a couple of days â€“ just as you would with a Flu jab. I do still try to maintain social distance though itâ€™s becoming increasingly difficult as people seem to be making less effort now than they used to. I feel quite uncomfortable if someone is too close. If Iâ€™m out I always wear a mask and use sanitiser entering shops, which I only do once a week for groceries. I swim three times a week and use the same safeguards there. You have to book a slot to swim and numbers are limited which suits me fine as the pool is never very busy. I think the latest guidelines and timescales are manageable and would rather take things slowly than risk another increase in cases. W3163 Groups of people are being vaccinated in this area in accordance with the Government schedule e.g. age groups/clinically vulnerable, etc. Thereâ€™s a lot of publicity regarding the various vaccines and a lot of misinformation on social media. I trust the science and the NHS for information. Regarding making vaccination mandatory and foreign countries, I think each country needs to choose its own rules and that includes the UK. Personally I donâ€™t understand why anyone wants to go into a sealed tin can with a lot of strangers and breathe recycled air for an hour, or two, or three depending where they are going. On the same note I am not willing to go to pubs or restaurants at the moment. These venues also should be able to set their own rules; if they want proof of vaccination they should be able to make that a rule. I know there are many people against vaccination of any sort but its thanks to vaccination that we no longer have problems with Cholera, diphtheria, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, and many more diseased which killed many, many people. The fact that people are starting to choose not to vaccinate their children through ignorance of how dreadful these diseases are means there is a risk of these diseases starting to spread once again. So, if it were possible I think vaccination should be mandatory for the sake of all people. Though I doubt it will ever become so."

It wasnâ€™t my age as this was February. I think itâ€™s because Iâ€™m recorded as being mydadâ€™s carer.I wasnâ€™t going to say no either way. I know that administratively, if I saidIâ€™d wait, Iâ€™d probably get taken off the list for refusing and thereâ€™s no wayI wanted to miss out. I was booked into the Corn Exchange in Devizes for my first jab. I walked into town from my home and myhusbandpicked meup afterwards in the car. The Doctorâ€™s receptionist had mentioned the possibility of not feeling well afterwards so I thought that was best. I got there a little early, so I had a wander about before going to join the queue outside the Corn Exchange. The doors were closedbut there was asign saying â€˜Queue to the rightâ€™. But the two men in front of me had managed to queue back round to the left. A few more people got there and we ended up queuing the right way, down Station Road. The queue went back towards the entrance to the nightclub underneath the Corn Exchange. I wonder how long it will be until anyone is queued up there again? I know about the so-called roadmap out of lockdown but thereâ€™s along wayto go until June. In the queue people had their masks on and were distancing. Then the person came out of the doors and aksed for those who were booked in for â€˜4:50 to 4:59 stepforwardâ€™. Someone misheard and asked if that was age. They mustnot have heard the â€˜4â€™ bit. But still, really? By this point, after the queuing the wrong way I was wondering if getting the vaccine was worth the annoyance of spending even this amount of time with my fellow Devizes residents. But thatâ€™s the goodthing about masks;you get to hide the annoyance. It was all straightforward â€“ the door woman asked us some questions and as I was in the first batch, I went in to stand in one of the queues to get the jab. There were some people from the Navy helping out with the jabs that day. I got jabbed by a woman who was in the Navy and normally works in Portsmouth. I had to keep chatting to her because I really needed to keep my mind (and eyes) off the needle. I had the Pfizer vaccine and had to sit for 15 minutes after the jab. Overall, everything was calm and well-ordered. Everyone took their time making sure they did the right thing, stood in the right place and did as they were directed. I didnâ€™t have any side-effects at all, other than a slightly sore arm. In fact, I woke up feeling better the day after the vaccine than the day of. Iâ€™m still following all the guidelines but some are now easing up which is good. I donâ€™t watch all the updates but I did watch on 22 February when the roadmap out of lockdown was unveiled. I did think the â€˜crocus ofhopeâ€™ commentfrom BoJo was ridiculous, but thatâ€™s to be expected from him. I googled the roadmap while watching and screenshotted the little pictograms from the â€˜Covid-19 Response â€“ Spring 2021â€™ publication: M7490 Female Age 46 Location: Devizes Occupation: Civil Servant I put all four pictures into one layout and refer to it a lot. Iâ€™ve also sent this on to other people as itâ€™s agood summaryofwhat we can do and when. Thatâ€™s the main question in conversations now; â€˜Whencan weâ€¦?â€™ Itâ€™s alot to try and remember! My favourite of the pics is the Nightclubs one â€“ two people under a disco ball yep, that qualifies as a nightclub now. Iâ€™m following the rules â€“itâ€™s a case of having to. If you want to go in a shop, you wear a mask and tryto keep distance but not everyone is concerned about distance so itâ€™s sometimes impossibleto do that in acrowded supermarket. Iâ€™m glad to still be wearing the mask. Having had one dose does make me feel better about going into the care home to visit my dad. Ifeel like Iâ€™m less likely to be bringing anything in. Ihave to have acovidtest every time Ivisit and wear PPE,but Ifeel that the jab gives mean extra level of confidence. Ihope everything goes to plan, but itâ€™s impossible to be sure. Withwhatâ€™s going on in India and Brazil who knows when things can really get to a more normal state of things. No one expected it to last this long when the first lockdown started in March last year, so Iâ€™m keeping an open mind, but I am hopeful. M7490 Female Age 46 Location: Devizes Occupation: Civil Servant I quite like not being forced to accept being crowded in next to people and having to accept people in my personal space. Itâ€™s morethan socially acceptable to want spacearound you â€“ itâ€™s in the government guidelines! Iâ€™m not concerned with the safety of the vaccines. Yes, there have been a few rare cases of blood clots, but all medicines have side-effects and I want this to be over. My father had the Astro-Zeneca vaccine before all the news about blood clots and he was fine. My husband has hadit too. Iâ€™m moreworried about people not taking it becauseof the worry of side-effects or misinformation about it and the prolonging of this situation. The vaccine programme After the callfrom myDoctorâ€™s surgery inviting me for the first jab they will call me back for the second. My husband had a letter inviting him to make appointments online for both jabs. He did so, but they were in Westbury.Sowhen his Doctorâ€™s surgery rang to invite him to his first jab in the Corn Exchange, he cancelled the online bookings. Personally, Iâ€™d have preferred to be able to book both at the same time. I get information about the vaccine and latest covid rates from the BBC. When I do watch the local news it reminds me of football scores â€“ infection rates up and down in various towns etc. Some of the misinformation about the vaccine is so ridiculous, how does anyone believe it? Iâ€™m not that interested. I know it has been tested and approved and that it willhelp bring rates down andget the pandemic under control. Thatâ€™s all I need to know to be confident and happy to get the jab. Making vaccines mandatory I think that countries can make their own rules on whether someone needs to have had the vaccine to visit. Why not? Thereâ€™s no absolute right that you cango anywhere. If you have a criminal record it may stop you visiting some countries, so why not a vaccine passport? Iâ€™ve booked aholiday this year, a UK cruise, and it is mandatory to have had both jabs before travelling. Thatâ€™s fine with me.It means everyone on the ship willhave had the jabs, making the holiday safer for everyone. I understand that somepeople wonâ€™t be able to get the jab for health reasons,which makes denying access to places in the UK tricky. I do think it should be mandatory for people working in health and social care with vulnerable people, unless there are medical reasons why someone cannot have it. For access in the UK it could be like the whole mask thing â€“ if you have a reason not to have had a vaccine, then you can enter without the passport, otherwise you have to have had one. Slightly off-topic on masks â€“whydo people wear them under their noses and think thatâ€™s OK?Also, I get it if you canâ€™t wear a mask,but if itâ€™s becauseof not being able to have something touching your face, do the next best thing and wear a face shield. Nothing touching your face but a bit of protection that wouldnâ€™t be there otherwise."

I had to get tested in order to go to a hospital appointment.  We drove to a car park near the out-patients department of the hospital at an appointed time (arranged by a phone call from the hospital). Someone came out and administered the test while I stayed in the car. It was most unpleasant!  Then we drove away.  If it had been positive they would have rung to cancel the appointment but I heard nothing, so it was clearly negative and I was able to keep the appointment. We did send away for a pack of the free NHS test at home kits, as a ‘just in case’ scenario.  My husband and I have each administered one of these – more out of curiosity than anything else, both negative. The tests are quite uncomfortable to do, but the instructions were clear enough to follow. I know the government have been encouraging everyone to administer these home tests twice a week as a precautionary thing, but I doubt that many people are doing that.   It’s a good idea, but I think we are all so weary, we can’t be bothered unless we have symptoms or are going to a special event. We should have travelled to France on 25th July at which time it was necessary to take a PCR test to travel. Booking this online through Boots was a nightmare. The site was so user unfriendly, and assumed a lot of prior knowledge which I didn’t have. I had to take and upload images of our passports (at least I think that’s what they wanted – it really wasn’t clear). Eventually we were given appointments in Cambridge City Centre – some half an hour away. In the end we cancelled the trip, because of the worsening Covid situation in both countries.  Subsequently we did travel to France, but by then the necessity for pre-travel testing had been cancelled. We will have to have tests before we travel back to the UK – bookable at a local pharmacy, results within 20 minutes. We also have to pre-book Day 2 tests for when we get home. The reference number for this test is required when we travel back, or we won’t be allowed out of the country. There’s been a lot of online conversation about these Day 2 tests. The Government has a list of private companies that offer the service, and apparently the prices range from £20 to £80. Most people seem to be opting for the cheapest test, but when they get back to the UK often the tests don’t arrive, or don’t arrive in time, and people don’t always get the results.  It really does seem the companies are laughing all the way to the bank.  I’ve read in an online user group that people aren’t bothered about that – all they really need is the reference number on their cross-channel booking.  It’s a total rip-off. As for accuracy of the tests, I guess there is some concern, but on the whole I feel they are pretty much accurate. Test and Trace I did download the NHS test and trace app and have used it when going to coffee shops. One of the things that occurs to me is that without a smartphone, life would be difficult. If we didn’t have a laptop and smartphone each we wouldn’t have been able to travel to France. I think it’s a good idea, but when it was first started, it seemed like a very expensive fiasco. Dido Harding’s involvement was typical of the way the government has badly handled things. I haven’t been contacted by being in contact with anyone, although my daughter was -twice – and self isolated as required, and was fine. When the number of contacts became very high, I’m sure there will have been people who called in to work saying they’d been ‘pinged’ when they hadn’t, just to get a week off work. There would be nothing to prove otherwise!"

So I can’t say that lockdown altered what you might call regular patterns of daily life with regard to time. Behaviours, yes, they changed, so in a way time was involved. For example, as far as routines go, my husband and I were in the habit of frequently visiting local coffee shops sometime during the morning usually, for a cappuccino or two.  This, of course, ended fairly abruptly and instead we just had coffee at home.  This coincided with a friend in our village suggesting several of us got together at 11 each morning via Zoom to have coffee and a chat together – thus a new routine was established and has continued. I wouldn’t call this a ‘disruption’ – it’s a pleasant addition. Because this is set at a specific time of day, then I am made more aware of the time, so I aim to be ready online for the 11am call. This passes the morning on nicely – not that we have been short of things to do as with the fine weather we have spent most of our time being busy in the garden which has been a bonus. I wouldn’t say that aspects of my life have either speeded up or slowed down.  It’s true that I’ve had more time to sort out the garden through being enforced to be at home but this is more about having time available.  I did start an online Future Learn course to do with education in museums, but didn’t complete it – nothing to do with time, all about the course ending up not being right for me. Because I’ve spent a lot of time outdoors in the garden I’ve certainly been very aware of changes in weather and how seeds and plants have developed, as well as the increasing amount of light as we neared summer. Birds come to the garden so I’ve seen them in the process of gathering nesting material – we had to wait to clear ivy from a tree trunk because wrens were nesting in there. We’re lucky in being able to walk our dog in a friend’s field just across the road and have watched different wild plants growing along with the grass, and the blossoming of mature trees around the edges of the field.  One particular old horse chestnut put on a fabulous show of blossom before the fruits started to develop.  Just in front of it we watched a large patch of verbascum (mullein) grow and flower; they were beautiful in the morning sunlight and closed up later in the day.  As the grass grew it became more and more difficult to see the dog as he raced ahead of us! During July the field was alive with butterflies as this is a field which is uncultivated and just cut once a year for hay. We’re fairly well established in routines now, spending most of our time around the home. We have been out a few times now for our coffee, to a place where we can sit outside, and that is nice, but I don’t expect things to change much for a while.  I don’t feel like rushing back to going out and about except when it’s necessary.  I’ve come to accept that I can’t so I just try to make the most of what I can in the place where I am.  I’m very fortunate that I can do that and I’m sure that being retired has helped because I don’t have a work commitment to determine my time.  Homelife There’s been little change in how we spend our day, apart from going shopping or socialising.  We walk the dog in the morning and again in the afternoon just as we always did before lockdown.  We eat at the same times, watch TV in the evenings or use the computer or listen to music and go to bed at the same times as before. Nothing impinges on that. There’s been no need to change. There’s just myself and my husband (and the dog!) in the house so there’s been no need to negotiate time.  My husband has a study in a separate room so we can be apart to follow our own pursuits if we choose without disturbing each other. Again, being used to being at home together for a number of years has meant we’ve been used to organising our days in a home situation.  Because we’ve had more time to work in the garden, that worked well, as we either worked on a job together or shared out the different aspects of the job in hand.  I can’t see any of this changing in the future, it’s pretty much what we always do. Media and Technology As I mentioned earlier, we have had regular Zoom chats with neighbours, which has been good fun.  We also had a Zoom quiz and another friend invited us to a Zoom dinner party.   A few weeks ago we started doing Click and Collect online grocery shopping, which has been great and I can certainly see that I would happily continue with that.  We had our first visit to a supermarket just last week and even though it was quiet, I found the whole experience stressful.  I much prefer Click and Collect.  As well as that, we started to have ‘Hello Fresh’ recipe boxes delivered, which entailed choosing each week’s menus online.  It worked really well and I enjoyed having three days a week when I didn’t have to plan meals, nor did I have to shop for the fresh ingredients.  It just all came to the door and I enjoyed and appreciated it.  We wouldn’t have done that without lockdown. Although we’re not using it at the moment (we have come to our home in France) I will start it again later in the year. We also bought some items online that previously we would have gone out to shop for.  We needed a new printer and found that online.  I’ve also ordered some cosmetics and books.  I felt bad about relying on the postman to keep doing his job to bring us things like this, and made a point of thanking him, but I started to feel easier about it as time went on.  I do now feel more tuned in to online shopping, so that is a change in my habits. Waiting Normally we would have been on our way to France in late March.  That, of course, had to be postponed and we were waiting for three months until we were allowed to travel to the EU.  So that was definitely a period of waiting, not knowing when or if we would get to our house in France at all this year.  My husband was particularly anxious about it, whereas I saw being at home in Suffolk at a time when we’re not normally there, as a bonus.  The garden has been crying out for attention for years and at last we were able to tackle it and get it looking really good, including growing a range of veg, which we usually do in France.  We took the decision to ask friends who live nearby in France to cut some of the grass for us (for which we were happy to pay) to keep in fairly tidy and to save some work when and if we could finally visit.  We came here three weeks ago and were very glad we’d done that as there was enough to do without starting to cut huge amounts of grass! Because we were lucky enough to have deliveries from market traders early on in lockdown, the Hello Fresh deliveries and my daughter brought other shopping for us, we haven’t experienced to queuing that so many have.  And the more we don’t go to shops the less we feel we want to. Has my life been put on hold? Only in relation to waiting to be able to travel – at the moment I’m more concerned about the potential effects of Brexit – waiting to learn how that will affect us is a worry."

Mass-Observer W7312 describes themself as female; age 52; married; academic notetaker.;The Directive 'Household Recycling' was issued on 8 April 2021 and asked Mass-Observers to list the items that they put in their recycling bin 'during one ordinary day', and also their experiences of and opinions on recycling and household waste, in particular 'recycling at home'; 'recycling collections'; 'why recycle?'; 'shopping choices'; and whether their 'recycling habits have changed as a result of COVID-19'.","Spring Directive 2021 Part 1: Household Recycling MO Number:  W7312  Gender:  Female  Age:  52  Marital Status:  Married  City:   Derby  Occupation:   Academic Notetaker  This Directive is about the way you deal with recyclable waste. It is based on similar surveys carried out by Mass Observation in 1942, which were interested in whether civilians saved wastepaper and bones to help the war effort during the Second World War. Many of you will remember a Directive on single-use plastics issued in 2019 – and perhaps even earlier Directives on thrift in 1987 and 2016. In this Directive, we are particularly interested in your routines and the things that shape your actions when dealing with your household’s waste. Task: We would like you to make a list of the items you put in your household recycling bin during one ordinary day. Make a note of the item and the room in your house that it came from. Recycling at home What items of waste do you recycle at home and where do you keep them? How are they organised? How does this relate to your outdoor bins? As a family we try to recycle as much as possible. In our kitchen we have two pull-out bins; one is for general waste and the second bin is for recycling.  Are there any items you keep to re-use? I keep glass jars.  Bizarrely I have quite the collection now!  I have a particular fondness for glass ornaments and I find that some jam jars are so pleasant and I want to keep them. I wash them, store them and quite often place items such as cotton, ribbons, hair slides and so forth in them. I also keep little boxes that earrings or other jewellery have been packaged in and I tend to re-use these. We make our own yoghurt now so I have little glass jars that I re-use once they have been through the dishwasher. We all have re-useable water bottles and I have a Thermos flask that I take into work with tea in (before the pandemic). I also use cotton wool pads that can be washed, dried and used again. I literally just pop them into a little bag that came with them, tie it up and place it in the washing machine on a 60 degree wash.  Then I dry them on the windowsill.  I have saved quite a bit of money using these. We all use bamboo toothbrushes and I still use flannels to wipe my cleanser off.  One of my friends joked that using a flannel was old-fashioned but to be honest, I feel it is friendlier to the environment and it acts as an exfoliator as well. Thinking about the items of waste you recycle at home, how do you know that these items are recyclable? Are there any that you are uncertain about? I always check on the packaging whether an item is recyclable.  The one thing that I am unsure about is wrapping paper.  For birthday and Christmas presents (for my family and others) I have bought recycled brown paper. When my daughters were younger I used to buy all sorts of sparkly and wonderfully decorated wrapping paper but now I use the brown paper and decorate it myself.  My two teenage daughters are very environmentally aware and they asked me not to buy wrapping paper that could not be recycled. How did you treat these items before putting them in the bin? For example, did you wash or take any of them apart? I always wash the plastic bottles and containers and I tend to flatten cardboard boxes so that they are easier to store in the recycling bin. Recycling collections How is recycling collected in your area? Where is it collected from? How regularly is it collected? The blue recycling bin is collected on a fortnightly basis. It is collected from outside our house.  Are there different processes for paper and card, different plastics, tins, glass, textiles, food and garden waste etc? We can put paper, card, plastic, tins and glass into our blue recycling bin. Has this changed in recent years? If so, how? We used to be allowed to place old magazines in the blue recycling bin but we are no longer permitted to do this.  I used to buy paper versions of magazines but now I prefer to read them online.  Although both my teenage daughters prefer to read paper or hardback copies of books, I must admit, I love my Kindle. Do you regularly take items to communal facilities like bottle or textile banks? If so, how do you get there? How regularly do you visit this facility? At Christmas I will take extra bottles and boxes to the communal facility at our local Morrison’s store. I also like to recycle clothes and have given bags of both my own and my daughters’ clothes to charity shops or even passed them on to friends, family and neighbours. Leaving aside general waste, are there any items that you don’t recycle? What stops you? I try to recycle as much as possible but things such as cling film (as far as I am aware) cannot be recycled.  We try only to use it as a last resort and we have the reusable covers for bowls with leftover food now and these can be dish-washed. Why recycle? What motivates you to recycle? For instance, do you relate this to being environmentally responsible, to the climate, to reducing waste, or something else? What has influenced these motivations? I feel environmentally responsible and I feel a responsibility towards my daughters’ generation and those that are even younger.  I do not like wasting food and we try our best not to do so.  My Dad did most of the cooking when I was younger (Mum hated it and he enjoyed pottering in the kitchen after work) and he insisted that nothing should be wasted.  It is quite funny really because we still joke about Dad’s ‘Everything in the Pot’ stews where anything from the previous day would be thrown in, together with herbs and an abundance of garlic; the result was always delicious although none of us could quite work out how • Are there any times that you have made a special effort to recycle? Or are there any times where you haven’t been able to recycle? I try to recycle all the time. I suppose a special effort might include clothes.  I have taken so many clothes to charity shops and in particular, my daughters’ clothes. If an old tee-shirt is well past its best before date then I will cut it up and use it for dusting and polishing.  What do you think happens to your recycling once it is collected? To be honest (and I feel rather ashamed to admit this) I am not sure. Do you think good use is made of it? I really hope so. Shopping choices Do you ever make shopping choices based on whether something can be recycled or is made from recycled materials? Yes definitely.  I much prefer glass bottles and I must admit, I tend to ‘tut’ a little when I read where an item cannot be recycled.  My daughters and I like to shop where we know the company ethos is one of sustainability.  And finally… Looking back over the past year, do you think your recycling habits have changed as a result of Covid-19? I think that because we have not visited supermarkets, we have really tried to adapt at home.  For instance, we make our own yoghurt now so use little glass pots that can be dish-washed and used again. I also make Water Kefir now (whereas before the pandemic I might have picked up a bottle of Milk Kefir from the supermarket).  I have about six tall glass bottles that I use and wash out after use. Because of Covid-19 and the fact that people were unable to travel (cars, planes, trains and so forth), it is interesting to read about the impact this has had on the environment."

For many of us, our daily rhythms and routines have altered significantly following different government and workplace guidelines. For some, the days may seem to have bled into each other while for others the pace of life has become more frenetic. Time is generally something that is taken for granted but the pandemic has made many of us notice it in new ways. In this Directive, we ask you to tell us how time in your daily lives may have changed– or stayed the same – as a result of the pandemic. At this moment (August 2020), as lockdown is gradually easing in the UK, we would like you to please look back on your experiences of time and COVID-19 so far, consider what it means to you for life to get ‘back to normal’ (if it is) in the present day, and imagine what you think the future might hold.   As always, please include anything that is important to you that you feel is missing from our questions.  Rhythm and routine of the day In what ways, if any, has ‘time’ in your daily life been disrupted?  Although I have been going to bed and getting up a little later, the time does seem to have passed very quickly.  It is bizarre because only the other day I said to a family member that it feels as though we went to bed on 17th March and woke up in the middle of August!     In the first days of the lockdown, did your daily rhythms, routines, or habits change? If so, please say how and describe how this felt. Can you recall how these changes came about? Were they connected to specific government regulation or advice?  When the government announced the lockdown, my daily rhythms and routines did change in that I slowed down somewhat.  There was no need for me to rush.  It felt very strange at first.  This was quite nice for a few days until I realised that I needed routine.  In fact, I usually crave routine so I attempted to introduce some form of structure to my day.   In what ways have different aspects of your life sped up or slowed down? For example, have you been furloughed from work or taken on caring responsibilities? Maybe you’ve been studying online or have taken up new hobbies. Please describe your experience of this.   Because my work centres round the Student I support, I was not furloughed and I was fortunate enough to be able to transcribe from online lectures.  I found more time to undertake activities that I would not have been able to do in more ‘normal’ times.  I joined an online group who were making non-medical face masks for vulnerable families.  I became a fabric cutter and would post my shapes on to someone else in a different part of the country in order for them to sew.  It was almost like a conveyor belt type of activity in that there were people who would donate the fabric (I already had some), those of us who cut the fabric and then those individuals who would sew the masks together.    In the very early stages of lockdown I also volunteered for The National Archives and their Royal Navy First World War Lives At Sea project.  This involves me transcribing from the service records of Sailors.  I am still doing this for a few hours a week and I thoroughly enjoy it.  Each service record tells a story in its own way and during the first few weeks of the lockdown, the work enabled me to think about History again and allowed me to almost escape (for want of a better word) .       I have also taken to gardening every day.  I used to ‘potter’ and have always enjoyed weeding (for some strange reason I find it therapeutic) but since the start of the Pandemic, I cannot wait to get outside to either prune the roses or plant more seeds that I have ordered from Amazon.  I love the nurturing aspect of planting and caring for flowers, plants and herbs.     Many people have spent more time than usual in their local environments. If this is the case for you, have you noticed anything in particular about the rhythms of the environment around you, such as the timing of seasons, plants, animals, the sun and the moon?  As a family, we tend to walk a lot.  Since childhood, I have loved to walk whenever possible and have always sought opportunities to do this whilst enjoying nature at the same time.  During the past five months, as a family we have spent more time in local parks, exploring the woods and relishing the chance to move about freely without the risk of bumping into other people.   Are your rhythms and routines changing again now? If so, in what ways? Do you anticipate them changing again in the future? If so, please describe how you feel about this?  My rhythms and routines are changing slightly.  For instance, until last Friday I had not driven for five months.  This was because my car was due for an MOT at the start of lockdown and I could not book a slot until last week.  I do not drive my husband’s car so it felt wonderful to actually sit in mine and drive through Derby on the way home, windows down slightly and music playing.    Over the past five months we have been shielding my husband.  All of our groceries and other supplies have been delivered.  This was particularly difficult during the first two weeks of the lockdown because we were unable to book a slot at any of the supermarkets.  Our friends and neighbours were wonderful in picking up the odd butter and milk but to be honest, we have always been incredibly independent and we did not always like to ask for favours.  Thanks to neighbours (we have a street WhatsApp group) we were able to secure milk, eggs and fruit and vegetable deliveries with an amazing Farmer and Greengrocer respectively.  We then managed to book slots with Sainsbury’s and we also sourced flour and other supplies from either the mills themselves or from small businesses throughout the United Kingdom.     Homelife For those of you spending most of your time at home, how do you make distinctions between different times of the day? Do you describe these times – to yourself or members of your household - in any new ways since lockdown? For example, do you have particular times of the day you leave the house to take a walk or have meals? What factors influence the organisation of your time?  I have tried to structure the day in a way that suits the whole family.  My husband has been fortunate enough to be able to work from home so he has spent most of his time on Zoom meetings and giving remote training to Doctors treating Covid-19 patients (he works with Ultrasound).  Our teenage daughters (18 and 14) have been fully on board with shielding my husband so they have tried to keep themselves busy at home.  My youngest daughter has been particularly active with school work.    We have walked every day since the start of lockdown.  At first, we would leave this until quite late in the evening in order to avoid lots of people but as the restrictions have lifted we have been going during the day or early evening.   For those of you living in households with others, how do you negotiate time in relation to one another? Do some people’s time matter more than others? Is this determined by work, caring responsibilities or maybe access to computers?  We have been very mindful that my husband needs quiet when he is on Zoom calls or giving training.  He uses a laptop and equipment provided by his organisation.  I share a home computer with my daughters.  My youngest daughter has spent the most time on it because of school work but I use it quite a bit in the mornings before she gets up.   In what ways have your lives come to be ‘in synch’ with or at odds with one another over the period of lockdown?  We have always spent a lot of time together as a family but I think during lockdown we have come to understand when one family member might need some alone time.     What changes do you anticipate in the time of your homelife in the future?  I think we will continue to spend as much time together as possible.   Media and technology Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to family or colleagues using online tools, having online medical appointments and/or shopping online? If so, has using these tools made a difference to how you manage, schedule or plan your time?   I am not sure what we would have done without technology over these past five months.  I speak to my elderly parents (they live 160 miles away) every day via Facetime.    I have had medical appointments via the telephone and we have shopped online for groceries.  To be honest, it has made us more organised!  We have a big food shop every three weeks and literally fill the cupboards.  Before lockdown, we would be ‘popping’ to the shops almost every day.  I do not miss going to the supermarket, I much prefer ordering food online.  I am rather hoping that we continue to do so for a while yet.   Did other materials – for example, notepads, diaries, wall calendars – feature as well? What did you use them for?   I use a calendar on my Samsung mobile telephone.  I write important reminders on this and I then have a separate ‘To Do’ list as well.  I use notepads and love Post-It notes as well.   If you used new media, technologies or materials, or changed how you used them as a result of COVID-19, do you anticipate that you will keep using them in the same way in the future? The Spring Directive included a similar question. If you answered it, have your views changed?  I think the newest technology that I have used is linked to the online lectures for my Student.  I understand that we may have to continue using this for part of her continuing studies at the end of September.     Waiting For some people, it seems as if life has been put ‘on hold’ during the pandemic. Does this feel relevant to you? If so, please say how. Have you experienced a particular pause or a delay, for instance in waiting for appointments, activities, a new job or for work to resume?   Yes it does seem as though life has been ‘paused’ but in some ways it has enabled me to become involved in projects that I might not otherwise have been.  For instance, volunteering for the National Archives and also the mask making group.     What is your experience of waiting? For example, you may have spent time queuing outside shops, waiting for deliveries, or waiting to see friends or family. Please describe how these times felt.  We have waited for deliveries and not seeing family has been the hardest part of the past five months.     For those who have been directly or indirectly affected by illness during the pandemic, how have you experienced time and waiting in particular in relation to incapacity, recovery, loss and grief?  Luckily we have been very fortunate health wise.  One of our friends contracted Covid-19 and was quite poorly.  Fortunately, he did not require hospitalisation and has made a full recovery."

Covid-19 and Time.  Has “time” been disrupted for me and my wife D? No is the straight answer, not in the slightest. I've been retired and in receipt of a Prison Officers pension since December 2014, and since then I've grown used to time being on my side. Time to think, write, play bowls in the summer, drink whisky all year, keep an eye on Dad each day to see that he eats his tea meal, and generally try to be an all round decent sort of bloke to my family and friends. I like the unhurried lifestyle, it suits me. I used to have a fast pace about me, I walked fast and people commented on it. I think it was because I was a busy man back then, a job, a wife, two daughters, things to do, places to go. Them I'm talking about, not me. Hell no, it was my job to ferry them around, a lift here and a favour done there, I galloped through my day to get my women to somewhere else. Now I've retired and my daughters have moved into their own homes, a calmness has befallen upon me, and my world has slowed down to a gentler pace, which suits me fine as now I have a hernia to worry about, and it doesn't suit to keep galloping anyway lest bits of me start to pack up or drop off all together. Neither my wife or I have any worries about sleep, though I need the use of a CPAP machine to push air down my throat of a night due to having sleep apnoea. Without it I tend to stop breathing whilst asleep and that's not a good thing to do. But I only mention sleep insofar as time only starts when we wake up, or I wake up is probably more accurate. I get out of bed between 9.00am and 9.30am most mornings. D on the other hand is shameless and can slumber on until after noon. At the start of the lockdown we found it easy, but boring. We've always been comfortable in each others company, but not being able go anywhere or do anything more constructive than a bit of food shopping every few days, did leave us feeling at a loose end. We read, we ate, we bought Netflix and slobbed out in front of the television for far too long of a night, and went back to bed for it all to start again. D has been furloughed from her job as a barmaid, though she may be headed back to work in the next couple of weeks, between us we've had pretty much nothing to do and all day in which to do it. As the restrictions were lifted, and we were allowed to spend more time outside of our homes, I've been on some nice walks along Walney Channel and further afield. And I've also taken off in my car to explore the lanes of Furness less well travelled. And that has turned out to be something I've enjoyed doing, either alone or with Dad. Being able to pick Dad up from his house and take him out in the car for an hour or more has been satisfying for the both of us. Dad has Alzheimer's and its a terrible thing to witness the slow insidious destruction of his brain from within. Here's me with time to burn, and Dad loses time from the days start to its eventual end. By which I mean he can eat a meal ten minutes prior to me arriving at his house, but won't be able to tell me what it was. It has often been said by myself and commented upon by my neighbours, that the days just seemed to meld into one another in a seamless fashion at the start of the lockdown. The only event that brought us back into focus was Thursday morning, when the bins were emptied, other than that a week could easily have held nine days or six. One thing that I have kept an eye on whilst out on my drives or walks, with or without Dad, is the tide. The tides have become more noticeable now that I've had time in which to notice them. The vast expanse of the clean washed sands of the Duddon Estuary that are left exposed to view when the tide is out is a thing of beauty, especially when viewed from atop of Kirkby Moor. Just as a high tide within Walney Channel brings with it an energy that has the little boats moored within it bobbing up and down and facing into the incoming wind with a determination, not unlike a form of  mechanical seabirds. There is one respect in which time has stretched itself, and that is in the ability to see a Dentist or Doctor. I'm sure that these positions are well paid, probably fair to say they're very well paid indeed, but you try and get to see one face to face. These past five months has seen waiting rooms of either profession shut to the public. I have had the misfortune of suffering a gum infection and a loose molar, and pain was plentiful in the early weeks of the lockdown. I'd actually made an appointment early in the new year to see my Dentist, and I was informed that I'd be seen in February when a new dentist was due to join the practice. This was then put back a month due to the Dentist delaying their start date. Then came the Covid-19 virus and the doors were locked shut. I'm still unaware if my new Dentist is even in place yet or not. As my pain steadily tormented me to levels beyond fair, I sought out help. This was basically a telephone call from a dental practitioner who patiently listened to my woes, and promptly arranged for a course of strong antibiotics to be made available for me at a chemist shop in town. A fortnight later, I received another call from a gentleman with a South African accent, enquiring as to the level of pain I was now experiencing. His point being that the only treatment open to me was to have a tooth, or any number of teeth, extracted. Though seeing as the antibiotics had brought the level of pain down from torture, to a degree of discomfort, I thanked him for his offer but politely declined. As for when I do finally get to see a dentist and receive some treatment, a descaling at least, is anybody's guess. Thankfully I am currently pain free and hope to remain so. I'm led to believe that the Doctors surgeries are similarly being kept empty. Repeat prescriptions can be requested online, a short telephone consultation with a Doctor can be booked for those in the direst of needs, and after that its either the hospital you look to, or the undertaker. Whereas just six months past, their waiting rooms were filled with all manner of ailing, failing and malingering needy people, today the surgeries are being kept empty. It would surprise me not, that as I'm typing these notes out now, Doctors and Dentists are quietly strolling around the nations golf courses cheerfully playing each other for a wager of £50 per hole. If I delve deep into my daily journal I will find the date when it was that I discovered an alarming lump in my groin, a hernia is what I expected to be told was my problem, and so it proved. I've since been to the hospital for a ultra-sound scan, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a very thorough Asian gentleman, who also reassured me that there weren't any other sinister happenings going on in that region. And so I registered myself for surgery as and when it became my turn. I'm still waiting. Last week, I contacted the people in charge of the appointments book for Furness General Hospital, if such a book actually exists, and I was informed that they do indeed have all my details, I am on the list for surgery to have my hernia corrected, but unfortunately no such procedures are taking place right now. Nor could they tell me when such procedures would resume, other than to confirm that only the most extreme cases would be dealt with at first anyway, and if I felt that my quality of life was suffering greatly, then I needed to consult with my Doctor again in order that I be made a priority. Other than that, all that is left for me to do is wait. I'm getting good at waiting.  The towns football team are waiting too. They're waiting for the delayed football season to start, for this season sees them playing back in the football league after having spent forty-eight years in the non-league wilderness. Now in the grand scheme of things, whilst people are losing their jobs, others falling ill with this virus, and the economy tanking, football may not be to high a priority for some, and that's fair enough. But for myself and many of my friends, we're like kids waiting for Christmas. I've already purchased a season ticket though I don't know if I, or anyone else for that matter, will be allowed into a stadium to watch a game. Regardless, the fixtures are being released this Friday morning, and to be able to pore over this seasons fixture list, I simply cannot wait."

MO P7590 Female age 73. Married, from Kendal Cumbria. Retired The vaccination programme started just before Christmas 2020. With the first age group of over 90â€™s and the most vulnerable people. It then was given to the over 80â€™s then 70â€™s and so on I was very pleased to be able to have my first vaccination at 6.30pm end of February 2021. The centre for vaccinations at that time was held on the lower floor of our Doctors surgery allowing a one way system to enter and exit. My husband and I went at the same time but not together as we now live apart. We had the Pfizer vaccine and were told to sit in the waiting area after receiving it for 15 mins. I felt a bit dizzy after and thought this was because it was a very cold night and I suffer from Angina when I breath in the cold air. We were told that it would take two to three weeks for it to be fully effective. I didnâ€™t mix with others for two weeks although I did go out for exercise. We were still in a lock down situation so there was only food stores open. After two weeks I started food shopping again. My second vaccination was after 10 weeks on 18th April at 2.30 pm. The vaccination centre is now held at the Shopping centre in Kendal. So many shops have closed down in there now. My friend had hers at the same time. After a few minutes I felt dizzy again. It was much further to walk to the recovery seats and thought I would fall over. I sat there for about 25mins this time. Lock down was lifted that week but I stayed in for 10 days then started to go to all the shops again. I am buying a new house and wanted to look for some new beds and curtains. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to go around the shops again even if I didnâ€™t buy anything. It was like going on holiday. A longed-for event. I expected the number of new cases to start rising again as we all started to socialise but it hasnâ€™t. It is continuing to fall. We still have to social distance of 2 meters apart and wear masks which I think will be with us for some time to come. After two weeks I went with my friend to Lowther Castle and had a picnic. I drove us there in the car with the widows open. We felt wonderful after and are planning another trip at end of May. I would recommend the vaccine to anyone who is unsure about having it. I canâ€™t think why anyone would not want to. I have ignored all the false rummers flying around as to itâ€™s affect. I was made aware of possible side effects when I was given my first dose.  The NHS is trying to vaccinate all adults with first jab by July and we are told by government it is planned for all children from 12 upwards will start in September. There are signs everywhere covid related. Telling us to stay 2 meters apart or where there is a test centre or vaccination centre. Shops have signs on the door asking us to wear a mask before entering and sanitize our hands As there are still some adults who are refusing to have the vaccination the government has started a big TV publicity campagna using famous stars of the day to reassure us of the virtues of having the jab. All those who donâ€™t of course jeopardise the rest of us and the virus will never go away. We are told to expect a booster in the Autumn. Not sure if thatâ€™s the whole nation or just the elderly and the most vulnerable. We are told to expect another rise in cases in the winter. I hope we donâ€™t have to have another winter of lock down sessions Itâ€™s so depressing. Restrictions are slowly being lifted at 5 weeks apart. In mid-May socialising indoors will be allowed. Cinemaâ€™s, Theatres, pubs and restaurantâ€™s etc. will be opening again and In June some foreign travel may be available if numbers stay low.   There has been a government debate as to whether we should be given a vaccine passport. I think these could easily be forged and not worth the governments expense. If it is really necessary, I think a vaccination chip inserted in our arms that could be scanned when traveling would be a more effective way of proving we had had both our jabs. I am not planning a holiday this year as I will be moving house in the summer but I would like to pay a visit to see my grandchildren in the south who I will not have seen in the flesh for 18 months by then. Much consideration to a persons health and past medical history should be taken into account before this vaccination should become mandatory. It will not suit everybody or different strains of the virus in the future."

I belong to many societies and my week used to be very full with things to do with these societies. i.e. Our gardening society holds two shows per year where we can enter our produce in competition with others. Not just in our local town but many from the surrounding counties come and compete. There is also a plant stall. I had started growing plants from seed for the plant stall. Flowers and vegetable to exhibit. These were both cancelled I was left with loads of plants I didn’t need so had top give them away. A holiday planned with the gardening club was also cancelled. Our writing group were about to publish a book containing selected pieces of our work. That has been put on hold. I had just joined an art society that held regular talks and work shops. I only went once. In short ‘life completely shut down’ for me. Every day became the same monotony. Get up, do some gardening. Cook meals and go to bed. Nothing to look forward to. At first we all thought it would be over in a couple of months and we would all be able to resume where we had left off. Not so. There is no light at the end of the tunnel yet.  Yes we can go to the shops, pub, restaurant but with such restrictions. It isn’t what normal used to be. In my diary I have written about my first experience of driving after six weeks of doing none. I was terrified I was doing something wrong. I was driving the seven miles into Kendal to the Dr’s to collect   a prescription. A friend had collected the previous one. It had taken her four and a half hours. I couldn’t ask her again. Driving, I was totally disorientated without traffic. I thought I was on the wrong side of the road, I didn’t know where I was going and started to panic. As I drove up the main street and started to see people walking about, I calmed down. There were no shops open at that time. I did do more litter picking than I would normally do, around the village where we live. To get out and also do some exercise. Since then I have been out about once a fortnight to the shops for food or to visit friends at a distance. None of our activities have started again. I belong to the local WI and our president has set up zoom meetings once a fortnight so we can all have a natter. We have done some competitions, a few quizzes and generally supported each other. We have also had a number of deaths in our circle of family and friends which has really upset my husband and I. Again, this is recorded in my diary. When certain restrictions were lifted we did take a picnic to Wast Water but it was very busy. My husbands health has detreated more so of late and he has days where  he just doesn’t want to do much with me so I leave him alone. We don’t talk much. I think since his brother died so prematurely he has become more morose. It upset us both but he chose to shut me out from any help I offered which really has hurt me. I am not sure things will ever be what they were. Not for me anyway. I feel I want to make a change and move on, away from the situation I now find myself in. I hope I have the courage to do something about it."

On both occasions, I canâ€™t express how impressed I have been at the organisation and efficiency of the staff managing the processing of so many people. A huge contrast to what has felt like a Government-led shambles in previous months. I went to a local community centre, about 9 miles away, dedicated now, exclusively for the purposes of administering vaccines, and staffed by both health professionals and volunteers. The atmosphere was calm and conveyed a sense of being well managed. I travelled with my husband, who had his vaccinations on different dates due to difference in ages. I received the Astra Zeneca vaccine, and after the first one, felt a little shivery/ache-y and didnâ€™t sleep well â€“ but nothing too bad at all. Those symptoms disappeared after 24 hours. As more and more people have now been vaccinated, it is evident that many people are no longer tightly keeping to restrictions, even though the final easing of restrictions scheduled for a couple of weeks ago, was not lifted due to concerns about the spread of the Delta variant. For myself, having been â€˜double-jabbedâ€™ (I love this new phrase), I am no longer so concerned about closer contact with people and so Iâ€™m not staying at home as I had been a year ago. I wear a mask when in shops â€“ this is still required of us, but as we can now welcome people into our homes, I am also welcoming and giving hugs to those I care about. I do recognise that while I could still catch and pass on the dreaded COVID, the impact of this is diminished as those I am in close contact with are also â€˜double-jabbedâ€™. At present, I am not required to go into my place of work â€“ the local University, and I am happy not to do this, as so many students have still not been vaccinated. That said, by the time of writing this, over 18s are now able to get their first jab in England and Wales â€“ which is truly effective as a roll-out, having progressed down through the age groups. I have never had any particular concerns about the safety of the vaccines. Although there has been some media focus on the safety in particular, of theAstra Zeneca vaccine â€“ particularly amongst the younger members of the public, I believe the data I have been made aware of, that indicates that the likelihood of negative reactions to it are far lower than the risk of catching COVID â€“ and suffering ill effects from this. My son who is 27, and works in the health sector, had the Pfizer vaccine â€“ maybe I would have had more concerns had he been vaccinated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine. The concept of travel corridors and â€˜green list countriesâ€™ which are areas we could currently choose to travel to without quarantine (but some requiring a negative PCR test to show we W7332 are not currently infected with COVID), is very much in the news at present. It appears that countries are being moved at short notice from the green list to the amber list, and so making travel bookings remains complicated and is ideally done at the last minute. Other countries are also changing requirements for UK travellers, as we are seen as having a high rate of the Delta COVID variant. My family and I are very happy not to be leaving the country for holidays at present. Unlike what appears to be many fellow UK citizens, I donâ€™t consider foreign travel to be an entitlement or a necessity, even if we have been through a horrible and traumatic time. Because of differing rates of vaccination within individual countries, I do believe that we are in line to be required as a matter of course, to prove our vaccination status for travel. I have recently downloaded the NHS App, and this offers a step in this direction, evidencing my own status. I am ok with this, as long as this data is held securely within the NHS App, and there isnâ€™t at a later stage, a requirement for us all to hold more generic ID-based Apps. What a resource that would be for major hackers â€“ we are aware of the growing scale and incidence now of cyber crime. In the meantime, I can see that something like the NHS App, or other â€˜vaccination passportâ€™ could well become a necessity for attendance of larger events etc.. All well and good for those who are able to download and use appropriate technology. Not good for those who are outside the system. My elder son currently lives in Taiwan, a country which by rigorous measures has very effectively managed to avoid much of the negative impact of COVID. Taiwan however, now has its own surge in cases, brought in to the country by a pilot who had not been thoroughly following quarantine rules. Taiwan hadnâ€™t needed to progress vaccinating its population as swiftly as the UK, so my son â€“ who had been in a very safe place -is now in a less secure position with no vaccination on the horizon for him. He has however, been called to make his appointment for his vaccination in the UK. Some bitter irony there. At the point when he could choose to journey home to the UK, would he need a vaccination passport? Would he be able to get one? These are concerns I do have. Without there being universal vaccinations â€“ throughout the world -countries with only a small proportion of their population being vaccinated, eg. Australia,  do indeed run risks in the longer term, once travel starts to free up again. This will certainly be interesting to explore in years to come. In the meantime, I am willing and complicit in the democratic system which allows others to make such huge decisions on our behalf. I couldnâ€™t do it."

I had reminded our son to take a number of lateral flow tests for school in June and July – he was supposed to do this every Sunday and Wednesday evening between 5pm and 7pm, but we didn’t always remember – and in recording the results of them on the government website, which was laborious and to my mind pointless if the result is negative (however, I signed something for the school to say I would enter the results and so I did). Since September, we’ve had more experience with tests, as our son has been routinely informed he has been in contact with someone who has tested positive (usually at school) and therefore should take lateral flow tests daily and PCR tests on day two and day six. The availability of slots at the local drive-in site is variable so he has done PCR tests by post as well as on the site – but it is easier to do it at the site because the postal one involved folding together a box and recording multiple serial numbers on the online portal. In one case, his contact was at basketball training for the local club rather than at school and we got rang up by the test and trace people 4 days after the contact, so he could only do the second PCR test. I suppose the story (I really don’t like terming these things stories – I don’t really see writing for MO as telling stories) is that on the third occasion our son was in contact with a positive case, we were contacted by the school on a Friday (the school has always been much quicker and more efficient than test and trace). Therefore, we booked a PCR test for him for the next day (Saturday). The result came through in the early hours of the morning that he was positive (he had no symptoms or illness of any kind) and so he would have to self-isolate for ten days, which he did. We promptly booked PCR tests for that afternoon (Sunday). After we got back from those, I was rung by test and trace telling my son (they have my number because we are not putting the contact details of a 14 year-old into the website) he was positive etc. I said yes, we know, and he is now self-isolating. Our tests were negative. The next day (Monday), my wife got rung as a contact and then told off for having taken a PCR too early as she would have waited to the second day after contact. She pointed out that the contact was our son whom we live with all the time and not someone who she had sat near in a café for ten minutes. No one rang me. On the Wednesday morning, I had a text telling me that test and trace were trying to contact me and that I should answer the phone, but they never ever actually rang and I had no missed calls. We had another PCR on the next Saturday and were still negative. However, both of us were ill with bad coughs and sore throats (the so-called ‘cold from hell’) so we didn’t go out and effectively self-isolated. I’m not sure what any of this tells us – except that the system is working more or less in Wales. Whether the tests work absolutely reliably – and whether the ‘cold from hell’ was actually what people who have been double vaccinated get from Covid now – are questions that I’m not going to speculate on. At some point we’ll get proper scientific answers and there will be a medical consensus on what has happened (… hopefully). Who benefitted? Well, we did self-isolate and so probably didn’t spread Covid further (thus maybe protecting some people). However, pretty much my son’s entire friendship group and most of the school population have had it by now. So, in terms of this autumn, I’m not sure test and trace is really stopping the spread of Covid rather than charting it. In some ways it is absurd, when facemasks are not required on public transport and shops in England (and the wearing of them is not 2 H6949 enforced in those jurisdictions, such as the London transport area and Wales, which do still require facemasks). We have benefitted to the extent that our son can now prove he has had covid. He has had a vaccination (he luckily had it on the Monday of the week which ended with him testing positive or otherwise they would have made him wait 90 days after having it) and therefore with that vaccination and a certified positive, he will count in Germany as double-vaxxed and therefore be able to enter public places. (My wife is German and all the children have dual nationality so being able to go there is absolutely central to family life). Although, having said that, the paper documentation we have looks like something anyone could print up and so there is still a question of whether this will be accepted. Otherwise, the people who are benefitting are the people who manufacture the tests – millions from the public purse. My wife has just returned from a short trip to Germany and under the procedure now she had to prove she had bought a single-pack lateral flow test (for £15.00) to complete the locator documentation. This morning she had to take the test and then take a picture of it with her passport (or possibly a picture of each and upload it – as usual, the online process is a complete pain). We have packs of these tests at home from the school but no, another one has to be bought at exorbitant price (I’ve no idea what the unit manufacture cost is but there must be a huge profit on this). It all adds up (along with the other covid pandemic contracts) to billions and billions flowing from the public purse into the pockets of ‘Boris’s mates’ as my wife calls them. One could say, nevertheless, that testing has been essential this autumn due to the infection rates, but the truth is that everything that has happened this autumn has been entirely self-inflicted, or rather inflicted by the UK government lifting all restrictions in July and not vaccinating teenagers over the summer (spectacularly stupid!). The 20-30% odd of people who aren’t getting vaccinated are also responsible for the trouble. My view on testing is that the system described above is more-or-less functioning but within circumstances (lack of restrictions, slowness in vaccination) that don’t help it. If we had this functioning test-and-trace system from earlier in the pandemic it would have reduced the fatality rate (now officially over 160,000 and counting but probably at least 20,000 more than that). In Ceredigion where I live, the council did manage to operate an effective test and trace system from the beginning and this kept rates very low until this autumn, when covid has finally ‘ripped’ through the schools. However, this early test and trace success gave people time to get vaccinated. Treatment for covid is also now much more effective. Therefore, it is clear that a functioning test and trace system from the beginning of the pandemic would have saved lives nationally in the way that it has done locally here."

I wrote about this in my Covid diary (although I havenâ€™t yet submitted this batch of the diary) a couple of days afterwards (this is pp.180-181 of the diary): Mon 5 April I had my vaccination (AZ) on Saturday (3 April) night at 8pm at the vaccination centre. It wasnâ€™t very busy â€“ it was in a large open plan library (I think it is actually the law library for the university, which shares the site for Coleg ). I didnâ€™t have to queue long to get my piece of thin cardboard, with the details of my jab written on in biro (it all felt a bit â€˜wartimeâ€™) and the jab itself was surprisingly quick and painless. I ignored the instruction to wait in the car for 15 minutes and drove straight home because I was in the audience for an online panel discussion on zoom and didnâ€™t want to miss it. I was pretty confident that I wouldnâ€™t have an anaphylactic shock. I wonder how useful that 15 minutes is â€“ it would be interesting to see stats on how many people do feel unwell in that 15 minute period. In any case, I only live three minutesâ€™ drive from the site; if I had had a 30 minute drive, I guess I probably would have waited to be on the safe side. There is also a lot of discussion of the threat of blood clots, which is pretty statistically remote (I realise that is no consolation for the 7 people who have died or their families). In fact, an academic I knew posted on facebook on the Saturday morning that the UK Government should immediately halt it. I refrained from responding. Apart from the sheer stupidity of that â€“ the utilitarian fact that far more people would die as a result from Covid than would be saved from having a clot â€“ there was no way I wasnâ€™t going to have my jabs because apart from anything else I want the possibility of travelling to Germany later in the year if possible. Furthermore, assuming that I didnâ€™t have it last March, I also wanted the jab for the protection (not that I feel particularly at risk in Ceredigion, which apart from a couple of minor flares in November and December has been especially safe throughout). I felt fine for the rest of Saturday night but I did feel affected on Sunday â€“ it was almost like a return of my post-exertional malaise. I had to go back to bed for four hours. Today, I feel better than that but not as good as before I had the jab. However, A has ordered a skip so that we can clear out a load of junk from the cellar, the garage, and also from Sâ€™s old bedroom. So I have to be well enough to do some of that this week. Fortunately, M is here for the week as he was able to get some holiday in the run up to his brotherâ€™s birthday on , which by coincidence will also be his [the youngestâ€™s] first day back at school since last December (as year 9 are the least priority). Talking about priorities, the other thing about my vaccination is how late it has come given that younger people such as my sister and brother-in-law have already had theirs in England. However, the age profile is heavily skewed towards older people in Ceredigion and, to some extent, in Wales as a whole. At 55, it transpires that I am still in the younger half of the adult population of Wales as a whole; not to mention in Ceredigion, where I still count as young I think! Mark Drakeford said that all vaccinations for the nine priority groups would be done by Easter Sunday but although I just got in under that wire, I think they havenâ€™t yet finished vaccinating over-50s in Ceredigion. I must confess that I had also assumed that at 55 I was in category 8 but by â€˜over 55â€™ it seems they actually meant 56-50 and therefore, in fact, I am one of the oldest in category 9. Anyway, at least Iâ€™ve had it now. 9 H6949 I certainly still felt a bit fatigued over the next week or so although this might be due to it being after a hard term and doing too much over easter too. Itâ€™s also in the context of my having postÂ­viral/chronic fatigue syndrome as a longterm consequence of having a virus in March 2020, which may have been Covid but I donâ€™t know for sure because I didnâ€™t have the exact symptoms and it was impossible to get tested (and anyway I didnâ€™t think it was Covid at the time because I didnâ€™t seem to be ill enough). Given that post-viral fatigue/long covid is a result of the overreaction of the immune system, I suspect that the vaccination did stimulate my immune system and therefore trigger some of those fatigue effects (obviously this is just me surmising and not a medical diagnosis â€“ but I suspect medical opinion is not yet fully formed on this issue in any case). I have continued to follow guidelines. Boris Johnson (speaking only for England, of course) seems to think we can get rid of social distancing and masks by the 21 June; Mark Drakeford thinks weâ€™ll be wearing masks into next year. I donâ€™t mind wearing a mask. I do hope social distancing does get relaxed this year, so that not every theatre and cinema in the country goes bust. I think Johnson is being a tad optimistic (and his dates are clearly driven by political considerations rather than purely medical evidence). Overall, though, Iâ€™m optimistic that the vaccines will work and that once everyone has had two shots we will be able to move back to something like normal over the summer. It might still be appropriate to wear masks in some contexts. Iâ€™m not concerned with the safety of the vaccine â€“ itâ€™s pretty obvious millions of people have had it (all the various types) safely. I realise there is a very remote risk of blood clots with the AZ but as I write above, nothing worth skipping the vaccine for unless youâ€™re a lot younger than me â€“ but they are not now going to give AZ to younger people. The vaccine programme In Wales, they vaccinated health and hospital workers first. Locally, there was some issues attached to this, as vaccinations were carried out in Carmarthen which is a three hour bus ride if you donâ€™t have a car. Vulnerable people have been vaccinated at their GPs. Everyone else has gone to the local centres (I described mine above) in age rank (also as I describe above). Theyâ€™ve got down to my 28Â­year-old daughter now who has been given a date for her first shot in early June. Given the population is massively skewed to the older age ranges, this means they are very nearly through the first shots. Information comes from regular press conferences from the Welsh Government, which are detailed in the media such as BBC Wales or Nation.Cymru. I tend to read the reports covering the press conferences rather than watch them directly. Further information on Ceredigion specifically is also passed on by our member for the Senedd. If you had a specific vaccination appointment at a GP, then the practice rang up to detail the time and arrangements (as happened with my partner). If you are just on the general list, by age, you got a letter telling you when to go to the vaccination centre (as I did). Iâ€™ve also read various stories in the press on the vaccines (Guardian, Financial Times, New York Times) and I think the longer scientific stories are good. Whether the press should report on initial findings of as yet un-peer-reviewed studies is another question. I donâ€™t think the â€˜clickbaityâ€™ ways in which stories are presented on social media are always helpful. Sometimes you can see other people on twitter or wherever clearly getting the wrong end of the stick. Again, I think the answer is better science education and better civic responsibility education. Iâ€™m not sure that facebook appending a covid information tab to every single mention of the term â€“ i.e. mostly people saying they have had their first or second shot â€“ is particularly useful. 10 H6949 Making vaccines mandatory Vaccines do have good take-up rates across the UK and so I donâ€™t think they need to be made mandatory because as long as a high enough percentage of the population are vaccinated then you get â€˜herd immunityâ€™. I think vaccination would be difficult to make mandatory â€“ itâ€™s a monumental effort to roll them out on a voluntary basis. I suspect that by the time we got to a point where it was necessary to make them mandatory then we would have already lost the possibility of keeping the population in line with each other. Having said that, I have no time for anti-vaxxers. The best answer would be better science education, better healthcare, and the promotion of a more collective attitude in this country; the idea of complete freedom of choice is a particular right-wing ideology. As for passports, I think it will probably be necessary this year for some international travel to prove that one has been vaccinated (In England by app, in Wales we are apparently going to have a certificate). However, I donâ€™t think that will last long within Western Europe if all countries implement full vaccination programmes and the infections go right down. Itâ€™s not happening with pubs â€“ it would be unworkable. Iâ€™m interested to see how long it will last with sports stadiums etc. Already there are reports of the availability of forged vaccination cards â€“ i.e. the thin cardboard strips with the date of your jab written in by biro. So, people will be able to get round this but I think once enough people in the population as a whole have been vaccinated, it is not necessary to weed out the unvaccinated. The main remaining concern is vulnerable people who canâ€™t be vaccinated for whatever reason but Iâ€™m not sure that passports will make any difference to that issue. I suppose they might encourage a few people to get vaccinated who otherwise wouldnâ€™t (not out of conviction but out of not bothering). To be honest, I expect internal passports to peter out very quickly or possibly not even get going properly. I donâ€™t think the Government are really that interested â€“ especially if, as I say, the infection rates go right down. At this moment, there are concerns about the Indian variant and attempts to roll out the vaccines quicker to counter that but I think this will just increase take up. Either, the vaccines work in which case internal passports will be redundant, or a variant becomes resistant in which case weâ€™re back to square one and internal vaccine passports are irrelevant."

Therefore, I have just answered most of these points very briefly and in some places made references to that diary. Health: As far as we know, none of us in the house (myself, my wife A, my daughter S and my son, who turned 13 during the lockdown) have had Covid-19 although we have had viruses and colds, so possibly we have had it mildly and fairly asymptomatically. The lockdown has been stressful but it is a mixed experience and some days I am fine and some I feel more anxious – the anxiety is not so much about getting the virus (although that was certainly part of the anxiety at the beginning of the lockdown) as to what lies in the future. There are two main strands to this. One is that I work in London and therefore have a long weekly commute which I hate and I would like to give up my job and in some way the virus presents the opportunity to do this (especially as I turned 55 in May and can now take my pension) while at the same time causing anxiety as to how, if I go on, I will handle the commute if and when my university campus reopens. In other words, the pandemic has brought to a head an important decision I have been thinking about for several years and that is stressful and has generated some tension between A and myself. There was a week in which I couldn’t sleep and in the end I rang up the ‘Employee Assistance Programme’ of my university which is outsourced to a firm called Carefirst (see my ‘coronavirus diary 15.5.2020, pp.99-100). The call helped me identify that the problem was anxiety as I have described it in the sentences above. We discussed breathing exercises and so forth. I’m still experiencing difficulties in sleeping and some anxiety but because I know what it is, it is easier to deal with it, not to panic and just accept it as part of the uncertainty of the times. A has also used the same service through her own university and has had counselling through them by phone every week – today was the last session. A feels trapped in a small town in the corner of West wales. Normally she would go to London once or twice a month and to Berlin once a month (where she has a flat). Now she is stuck here and follows travel news continuously hoping for lifting off the lockdown (there is still a five-mile limit on travel her in wales as I write on 2nd July) so that she can feel as though she can go somewhere. This means we are in different places with respect to the lockdown as I would be quite happy for it to continue (it is easy to walk to the sea and up into the country from our house; we have a big garden etc.) and she is desperate for it to end. I don’t want to be able to travel to work in London; she is desperate to get to Germany and outside Aberystwyth more generally. But actually we have dealt with this discrepancy fairly well on the whole by just talking regularly/continuously because it is a discrepancy that we have had to deal with for nearly twenty years during which I have been commuting to various other parts of the country to work and she has been working in the location where we live. Throughout that time, she has seen my desire to get a job at home so that I can live at home as effectively creating a limitation on her own freedom to move jobs because then we would be stuck in that particular town. To be honest, if I had ever managed to get a job in the town where we lived, I think we would have been happy enough but that hasn’t happened and so there is ongoing issue about movement/location that this crisis has highlighted. Under other circumstances, I might have enjoyed the lockdown more as , for example, a few years ago when the combination of the lecturer’s strike and heavy snow meant that I spent four weeks at home. But that period didn’t coincide with or raise any bigger existential questions. And obviously, part of the tension of the current situation is the enforced staying at home apart from exercise. Only in the last couple of weeks have any shops been open other than supermarkets. Since mid-march, we have only been out of Aberystwyth five times and three of those trips were for medical appointments (eye appointments for A, which would normally take place in Aberystwyth but which have been moved to Aberaeron as part of the changes the health service has made to deal with consequences of the pandemic – see ‘coronavirus diary’, 3.4.20, p.24, 1.6.20, p.110, 22.6.20, p.125. It’s not surprising that the circumstances put pressure on people. Also, suddenly one becomes very self-aware of the slightest variations in atmospheric weather (any period of humidity is like suddenly bearing the weight of the world) and bodily feeling. Our son has also had his ups and downs and missed his sport (normally a lot of his time outside school would be taken up with his football and basketball clubs) and so we have played games, I have done basketball practice with him (we have a hoop) and got him out on walks and bike rides. He has literally become a teenager during this lockdown and entered puberty with spots and voice breaking etc and so he is more hormonal than he was. Over the last few days he has had problems with a spot on his leg which burst and then would not heal. This morning we rang the NHS hotline and then on their advice engaged with our doctor, filled out an online form and sent photos of the ‘wound’. Then there was a telephone consultation and antibiotics were prescribed, which I picked up in the late afternoon from the pharmacy. At the pharmacy they denied that they had my son’s details and claimed only three people were registered for our address but that was clearly because he has never had a prescription before. Our surgery had clearly not sent over the prescription but I went and talked to them through their intercom system (the surgery is next door to the pharmacy) and they came out and gave me the prescription and so I was able to take it into the pharmacy and get it. The Government: For a start, there is more than one government involved. In Wales we have a Welsh Government and one of the stories of the lockdown is how the Welsh Government have diverged from the Westminster Government. Also, the Northern Ireland and Scottish Governments have acted differently. To be blunt, devolved government has saved lives in those countries because the UK Government have behaved with reckless and culpable neglect and should in my view be held as legally culpable for tens of thousands of deaths, especially those in care homes. I’ve written about this extensively in my diary (too frequently to cite) but there were a number of missed opportunities for action, which I’ve summarised very broadly here: 1. In late January and early February, when it first became apparent that Covid-19 was going to become a problem in Europe, Johnson was preoccupied with leaving the EU and then having celebrated leaving the EU and shuffling the cabinet into his own mould, he went on holiday for over a week. A lot of preparations could have been inaugurated in this period and the later shortages of PPE averted. The capacity of the Health Service has been undermined by ten years of austerity government but there was time for some urgent remedial action. The stock of PPE, lurking in a private warehouse in Greater Merseyside, could have been readied and updated. The national pandemic plan, which assumed flu, could have been updated. Instead nothing really happened for five weeks until early March, other than the decision to set up the Nightingale hospitals, which in itself was an indicator that the UK Government had decided that it was going to let the virus rip through Britih society and run up hundreds of thousands of fatalities. 2. On Thursday 12 March (the day after I travelled back from work in London for the last time) Johnson told the nation ‘I must level with you, level with the British public – more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time’. As I have said in my diary (see 24.5.20, pp. 110-111), I don’t think it is impossible that we will see this statement dissected in court (at least in an inquiry even if not a prosecution case). It is clear that the Johnson Government were pursuing a ‘herd immunity’ policy at the time but the effect of that speech was to trigger the beginning of an informal lockdown: for example, my university announced the day after that it was closing our campus from the following Monday. Over the weekend between, the Government accepted that there would have to be a lockdown but they didn’t implement this until over a week later on the evening of Monday 23 March. By which time, according to the Sunday Times Insight Team report of 24.5.20, probably 1.5M British people were infected. If the Government had started the lockdown from Friday 13 March, maybe over 30,000 lives would have been saved. Also, in mid March, thousands of patients were sent ‘home’ from NHS hospitals, often to care homes; another decision with disastrous consequences. 3. The UK Government started easing lockdown too soon but the key event was the Dominic Cummings Affair, in which he flagrantly broke the lockdown rules by driving to Durham with his family while infected. He then drove his wife to a beauty spot on her birthday in order to ‘test his eyesight’. Instead, of sacking him, Johnson allowed him to give a press conference in the rose garden of 10 Downing Street on Sunday 24 May in which he came out with all this nonsense. These events effectively put paid to the Government’s authority to make people obey the virus restrictions, which have mostly been lifted now and the 2m gap has been reduced. That many people in England think that it is all over is demonstrated by the scenes from beaches around England last week in the mini heatwave. But, the virus is still circulating, albeit at a much reduced level. Whereas, countries such as New Zealand and, closer to home, Scotland, are seeking to eliminate it completely, it is being allowed to circulate in England and therefore it can flare up again (as in Leicester). As a policy, this is the equivalent of touching wood and saying ‘hopefully, it will be ok’. I take it as confirmation that the UK Government’s thinking is that a second wave is inevitable and somehow desirable in a herd immunity sense. This is a political decision and it has potentially scary and fatal consequences. To summarise, there have been bad decisions made for a variety of reasons – including carelessness and inattention – which have led to maybe more than 60,000 deaths: the ONS record over 55,000 deaths in the UK with Covid on the death certificate but there are many more ‘excess’ deaths, which may well have been due to it. I no longer recognise the legitimacy of this government. That sounds melodramatic and the sort of thing a life-long anti-Tory might say but this is different to the past. I didn’t like the Cameron government but I thought of them as the UK Government and I even had some respect for the hapless may regime as Government; whereas the current administration are a shower of crooks. We should be building organised resistance, which in the devolved countries would take the shape of independence. Going forward, I think the UK Government will try and surf the wave of the virus in order to reshape political reality. For example, it is abundantly clear that there will now be a full scale assault on the universities and the humanities in particular, that university places will be reduced and FE/apprenticeships put in their place. It’s a culture war. At the same time, the Government are going to try and roll back trans rights, which will in effect be an attack on everyone’s capacity to express their gender and sexuality (see my replies to part one of this directive on gender). I don’t think this was the original plan. Well, I think the government was planning to do these things but they didn’t immediately perceive the virus as creating the opportunity to push through these changes faster. Originally, it caught them by surprise despite the fact that we had time to see what was happening in China, South Korea and then Italy. Then the Government tried to make it into a national celebration of ‘we’re all in this together’ Britishness but that was undermined by the fatality rate and the Cummings Affair, and so now they have just gone full ideological. They will prioritise getting the economy going, all kids back in school in September, and pushing through a Brexit trade deal or a no-deal exit. It’s touch and go which but I still think there will be a basic negotiated agreement because the ‘sabre-rattling’ on both sides sounds as though it is designed to support negotiating positions rather than anything else. But if it is a no-deal Brexit, then there will be economic pandemonium and shortages, and Scotland and Northern Ireland will go. Welsh support for independence, currently at 25%, will also jump. Nothing will happen with respect to the virus unless it spikes. I don’t want it too but it seems wishful thinking that it won’t once everything has been reopened in England (including pubs for this coming weekend). I think the UK Government are planning for the second wave in the autumn but whether they will be able to get people to voluntarily lockdown again is difficult to gage. I think the governments of Scotland and Wales have a much better chance because they still have the support of their publics who are aghast watching what is happening in England. I think the UK Government, will if necessarily exert more power including curfews and even martial law, if that is the only way they can impose lockdowns. There is also the possibility that emergency powers could be used to curtail the powers of the devolved administrations and also to manage a no-deal Brexit. I doubt that the Government are actually planning to do this but it is easy to see circumstances aligning so that this could happen. However, that kind of emergency might also lead to a National Government or even civil disorder so it is probably not the favoured option of even someone like Cummings. But the fact that Mark Sedwill, the Civil Service Cabinet Secretary, has been forced out by the Government doesn’t bode well. Eyes will also be on the US, where the infection rate has spiked again to the point that more than 50,000 new infections a day are appearing. That is out of control and the number will go up because the states concerned have only just begun reversing the opening-up measures. If it gets up to 100,000 day it could effectively mean civil collapse. Trump could then try and use martial law to cling on to power because at the moment it looks from the polls that Biden will win the presidential election in November. What happens in the US could effect what happens here. On the whole, the example is likely to be so bad that I think the majority of British people will want to avoid that, so I think therefore that the UK government won’t try and engineer this in the way that Trump government possibly have. But I still think we all need to cross our fingers because the situation is not fully under control. Democracy as we have known it is no longer operational in the US and England. News: I’m reading the Guardian, the New York Times and the Financial Times, plus other media sources accessed through social media. I have not watched any of the Government daily broadcasts (which were discontinued last week) but caught up on announcements via the Guardian’s live blog. I have not watched the BBC at all or indeed, any TV coverage, with the exceptions of some clips from twitter. Work and home life: Yes, both I and A are working for our respective universities. That has been quite hard but then it always is hard and time consuming. Most marking and administration tasks have been online for some years and so it is easy and in some ways it is also easier to arrange meetings online because it doesn’t depend on who is on campus on what particular day. In some ways, it is the same but without the nightmare 14 hour weekly return commute. It has impacted home life because we are at home all the time and this does require more cleaning, cooking, washing up etc because we are not eating lunches out of the home. Things wear out. We had to have a plumber in for the downstairs toilet. I had to repair the curtain rail. I’ve had to buy a new laptop. We have been schooling but at 13, my son is fairly self-directed and while I have helped him with maths in particular, he often gets on with his work himself and it is more a question of talking to him about it. Obviously, we are fortunate not to have small children anymore. Therefore, we don’t have issues with who should be working when or arguments about that. Like most people, though, we would like it to end… Technology: I’ve used zoom a lot because my university has bought a license and so we can use its full functionality. But otherwise, I work online a lot anyway and have a laptop, tablet and smart phone. I use social media anyway and so I haven’t really changed in that respect. The imminence of the lockdown did lead to me buying a kindle in March and I have used that a lot and bought books through it. I have had a few online social meet ups and we have a met a couple of people in the garden since that has been allowed, but in general there are four of us in the house and so isolation and loneliness are not problems, as they are for many. Shopping and food: I’ve documented my various trips to supermarkets in my diary. In the beginning there were shortages. Everything has long since settled down. We’ve had to do more cooking but we also have bought takeaways throughout the lockdown. Entertainment and Leisure: Well in some ways we haven’t had massively more free time than usual. We have made an effort to play lots of games as a family, especially in the early weeks (we both had a fortnight’s holiday over Easter). We own a lot of board games and have played variously: Alhambra, Carcassonne, Niagara, Dominion, Honshu, Azul, Ticket to Ride, Small Worlds, Talisman and some others. I’ve also played a lot of Magic the Gathering (MtG) with my son and daughter. I have exercise every day apart from a couple of times I was feeling really ill or tired. I’ve walked out a lot along the seafront or up Constitution Hill and into the fields beyond. We also bought an exercise bike just before the lockdown and I road that a lot at the start and more infrequently since because if it’s nice I’d rather get outside. I’ve lost weight – well, I did initially and I have stabilised again but I’m definitely fitter than I was before the lockdown. A and I have been ploughing through The Crown on Netflix, and have now finally nearly finished the third season (at a rate on one or two episodes a week). We have watched some of the National Theatre youtube screenings (on our TV): A Servant of Two Guvnors, Treasure Island, Frankenstein, Small Island and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (which was excellent but they have all been very good). I have read a lot but I always do read a lot. I’m currently reading ion my kindle a non-fiction book, Female Husbands by Jen Manion. But I’ve read getting on for 20 novels and about half a dozen non-fiction books overall since the lockdown began. Some topically related: as a result of BLM, I read Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race. Personal hygiene: possibly not shaving as much as usual but I’ve gone from a full beard to a goatee and so I wasn’t shaving that much before. Sleep: This has been the area in which I have been having difficulties in getting to sleep and sometimes lying awake in the middle of the night. As discussed above, I try and relax and breathe deeply but above all not panic because I am not getting to sleep. It varies and on the whole I think I’m getting enough although on some days I feel tired. Ultimately, I don’t think there is a solution until we are out of the anxiety-inducing situation and therefore I expect the problem to continue at least into the autumn."

Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to andfrom the vaccine centre? We live in the west of Sheffield, and many of our neighbours went to vaccination centres close to home â€“ a church thatâ€™s a five-minute drive away, a surgery on â€˜our sideâ€™ of the city, their own GP surgery. For some reason, my husband and I had to go to the Sheffield Arena, right across town. When we received our text notification that we were now eligible for the vaccine, we tried to book our GP, but they were still vaccinating people in their 70s. So we bit the bullet, did a dummy run to find the Arena and where to park, and then went there the following week, having booked our appointments online, just five minutes apart. Despite all our worries, it was a completely positive experience. The Scouse car park attendant (who told me his nickname was Scouse after I said his was definitely not a South Yorkshire accent) told us where to park and where to enter the Arena. And, even though we were about 20 minutes early, he said we could go straight through, which we did. Everyone was absolutely delightful â€“ from the women taking our names at the entrance to the volunteers pointing out where we should walk and queue, to the A&E doctor who gave us the jabs (so swiftly, with such a tiny needle or whatever, I really didnâ€™t feel a thing) and the furloughed singer/singing teacher who inputted our details into the computer in the cubicle. While we waited to enter the cubicle, I told the middle-aged female volunteer (with dangly earrings) that Iâ€™d only ever been to the Arena twice, once to see Dolly Parton, the other to see the Rolling Stones. My husband said heâ€™d only ever been once, to hear Pavarotti. She looked at us both, shook her head and said, â€˜Ah, different musical tastes, I seeâ€¦â€™ That made us laugh. And then the A&E doctor and the singing teacher, both female, talked about how positive they found the whole experience, as people were desperate to receive their vaccines and start getting the whole surreal experience into some sort of perspective. When we left the cubicle, a charming young man from St Johnâ€™s Ambulance asked if we wanted to sit down to recover before driving home. I said it was odd seeing people (whoâ€™d just been vaccinated) sitting in chairs facing the empty Arena â€“ all the seats where normally thereâ€™d be hundreds of fans. â€˜What are they all looking at?â€™ I asked. â€˜Ah, no,â€™ he replied, â€˜theyâ€™re the ones on the stage. They donâ€™t know it, but theyâ€™re the ones being looked at.â€™ I thought that was pretty adroit. My husband and I were so thrilled to have had our first vaccines, we drove out to Derbyshire to breathe the fresh air at Stanage Edge. And then went home to sleep for a couple of hours. The second time was just as lovely an experience. This time, the doctor said heâ€™d normally be working at the Hallamshire Hospital, and the woman inputting our details was a dentist back home in Nigeria, now hoping to get a job in dentistry over here. When she put something on her finger and passed it over to me, I thought it was a plaster to put over the (invisible) pin prick and started to put it on my upper arm until she stopped me. It was actually a sticker to say Iâ€™d had both jabs. We also had that information on cards we were given, which I photographed as soon as we got home. We also now have the NHS letters saying weâ€™ve had both jabs, which I downloaded from the internet. The second vaccine, I did feel completely washed out the following day, and spent a large part of it in bed. But it could have been simply the relief at getting it done. We wrote to the Arena afterwards to say how grateful we were for the whole experience. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) The Oxford Astra Zenica. How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? As I say above, neither of us had any after-effects the first time round. I may have had them the second time, or I may just have been being lazy, using it as an excuse to go back to bed on the Saturday after the jab. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.gsocial distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? Well, itâ€™s now Autumn 2021 (1st October), so no. As soon as we could post-lockdown, we went to the cinema (more times in two months than Iâ€™d been in the previous ten years, in our local independent cinema, where there were only ever eight or nine other people. And yes, we went in wearing masks, but soon took them off as we were more than two metres away from everyone else). We then had a meal at the cinema afterwards â€“ in the open air, as the weather was so nice. We also took ourselves off for a few short breaks in East Yorkshire and Northants. Again, we abided by whatever rules were still in place â€“ masks in communal areas, constant hand-sanitising, waitress service at breakfast rather than the usual buffets, keeping our distance from other people. We went back on the buses (still wearing masks), took a train from Beverley to Filey, went by train to London to stay with friends, go to exhibitions, eat out. The train down to London was uncomfortable as, without knowing it, there were two â€˜localâ€™ football matches taking place in London that Saturday, so the train filled up at Sheffield and then again at Leicester â€“ and no, of course the fans werenâ€™t wearing masks. They had too much beer to get throughâ€¦ I did feel uncomfortable about that, especially when one of the men started coughing, so we moved seats. So, where â€˜staying at homeâ€™ is concerned, no, as soon as we could, we went off wandering again. And loved every minute. My husband has even kept the first train ticket, first plane ticket (weâ€™re just back from a fortnight in Orkney), first ferry pass (Kirkwall to Shapinsay), just as he would have done as a kid, doing the first of things. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s all felt, as though weâ€™ve been slowly waking up again in a new-old world, venturing out, sniffing the air, seeing how safe we feel â€“ like our cat, who we rescued from five years of housebound incarceration with neighbours across the road. When we let her outside our back door for the first time, she sniffed the air, nibbled the grass, her ears went wild hearing the birdsong, and she tentatively padded round the patio. Then she was off like a tiger scenting prey. And that was usâ€¦ So now, in Sept/Oct, Iâ€™ll still wear a mask when boarding a bus, but may well take it off onboard if itâ€™s not busy (and no-oneâ€™s looking). I still wear masks and sanitise my hands in shops, if I feel itâ€™s what the shop wants. I still try and keep a bit of distance between me and other people, but thatâ€™s become a lot more relaxed generally. The university semester started this week â€“ with me doing one day a week of teaching at my old uni. So I did a dummy run the week before, as my former colleagues all had different ideas about what precautions theyâ€™d take. There are signs all over the university about wearing masks, keeping a distance, sanitising hands, wiping keyboards and other surfaces, etc. But I hardly saw anyone doing any of that. Even in the first year induction lecture, there were only four or five students wearing masks, no lecturers doing so, though the windows and door were open. I made sure I kept the door open during my lecture and seminars, but completely forgot to tell the students about the sanitiser. Iâ€™ll try and remember that for next week. As for a mask â€“ Iâ€™d find that too difficult to do when talking, though I know my sister, who teaches in an FE college, does. But sheâ€™s always been a lot more cautious about the virus than Iâ€™ve been. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? The simple answer is no. I know that some people have had severe after-effects, some people have died, and thatâ€™s tragic. But I also feel very strongly that vaccines are here to prevent disease and death, and I grew up at a time when people still caught polio or TB, and we had the vaccines as children. Iâ€™ve had yellow fever jabs when going abroad, and take malaria tablets for India and other countries with a high incidence of malaria â€“ so why wouldnâ€™t I take this vaccine? I did upset an Indian woman in my Mindfulness Zoom sessions back in the summer, by starting up the chat in the â€˜breakout roomâ€™ by asking her if sheâ€™d had the vaccine yet â€“ Iâ€™d just had mine and was still full of the whole experience. She obviously hadnâ€™t, and had no intention of having it, and was really upset and angry that Iâ€™d asked. When I tried to explain â€“ and that I wasnâ€™t targeting her as an Indian because I go to India regularly, love the place â€“ but she wouldnâ€™t listen, simply blanked her screen, and then left the breakout room, leaving me and my sister (as it happened) trying to fathom out what had happened. It did upset me, and I sent her an email afterwards via the Mindfulness leader, but she was still having none of it. So there was nothing more I could do â€“ though it reminded me that I canâ€™t assume everyone has had the vaccine. Then there was our previous window cleaner, a 23-year-old whose fiancÃ©e was a trainee nurse who spent much of the lockdown on COVID wards. Neither of them were going to have the vaccine, he said, because sheâ€™d done lots of research and wasnâ€™t convinced that it wasnâ€™t a social control tool â€“ and would make one or both of them infertile. He went on and on about it, and I decided there was no point arguing. That was his view, this is mine. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinatekey workers). Iâ€™m answering this some time after the questions were posed, so Iâ€™m not sure my responses would be particularly relevant. But, in addition to what Iâ€™ve written above, Iâ€™ll just say that I think it was rolled out in an incredibly efficient way, and both I and my husband are truly grateful for the way the NHS responded to the crisis, and to the vaccine programme. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on thepublicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. As a journalist, I like to get my information from the mainstream media (in particular the BBC and The Times), not from social media or any other unreliable source. Both my sisters have been nurses, so during our weekly Zoom conversations, theyâ€™d talk about the vaccine, the research behind it, the pros and cons, etc. And they were also hyper-keen to have the vaccine just as soon as it became available. Iâ€™ve not bothered with any anti-vax messages, as I put my trust in those who have rather better medical knowledge than I have, not conspiracy theorists (aka mad people). Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums.Please share your thoughts on this topic. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? Again, Iâ€™m answering these questions a good few months further down the line. The Scottish Govt have just today introduced vaccine passports for people wanting to go to nightclubs, football matches, etc â€“ and the online system appears to have crashed through the demand. I donâ€™t mind having to provide a â€˜vaccine passportâ€™ for travel purposes â€“ though a recent trip to Orkney didnâ€™t require them (Orkney being nominally in Scotland, though really itâ€™s more Scandinavian). As for whether vaccinations should be mandatory â€“ Iâ€™m not really in favour of people having to demonstrate that theyâ€™ve had both vaccinations if they only want to pop into a pub for a pint, or go to a football match in the outdoors. But if theyâ€™re working in a hospital or care home, working directly with vulnerable people, then yes, I think they should be made to have the vaccine, unless thereâ€™s a valid health reason for not having one. In that case, could they not be redeployed to a non-public-facing role â€“ at least until such time as we can really believe that having coronavirus is no worse than catching flu? It really all has been such a surreal experienceâ€¦"

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? Howdo you define these words? Answer: Health means being well, not having an illness or serious health condition or being disabled in any way – though, having said that, someone who’s blind or deaf (I’m using shorthand here) or in a wheelchair can still be healthy. It’s mainly a physical thing, though – unless prefixed with the word ‘mental’. But even then, it means being mentally well/healthy, not afflicted by anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, paranoia, whatever. Wellbeing I guess means something more holistic – physical and mental wellbeing, being at ease with the world and one’s place in it, one’s circumstances. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please sharethe first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Answer: Fit, in-good-working-order (one word!), able. But then again, referring back to my previous answer, the Paralympics show all sorts of people with all sorts of disabilities who are otherwise healthy and fit. I know people who are extremely (sometimes competitively) fit – people who run, cycle, do ultra-marathons. On the face of it, they have healthy bodies – but who knows? Some of them may have cancer or they may be suffering from severe anxiety. Whereas you can also find people who aren’t particularly toned or activity­holics but who eat/drink/exercise moderately and whose bodies do what’s needed of them without strain. I’d say those people are pretty healthy. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Answer: My friend J. She had breast cancer in her 40s, is now in her 60s, eats fantastically (but not fanatically) well, drinks in moderation, exercises by walking, gardening, tending her allotment and weekly Zumba classes, is very slender, has had two children, now has three grandchildren, is very balanced, not prone to anxiety or depression. I’d say she’s a very healthy person in a very healthy body. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Answer: I grew up in the 1950s in a family where there were six children and not much money (my father was a gardener, my mother a fulltime housewife in my childhood). We always had enough food but not too much, probably had too many sweets and sugar-heavy drinks like Tizer and Lucozade (hence the tooth decay), ate fresh vegetables and fruit (some of which Dad had grown), sometimes drank milk straight from the farmer’s churn (rural living). Neither parent drank very much at all – Dad would have the odd beer when he could afford it, Mum the odd ‘Snowball’ – but only when I was in my teens. Much of our food was home-made, except when I was in my teens, when things like Vesta curries and Angel Delight desserts entered the house. We were never ‘foodie’ – and I’m still not, even though my husband has written hotel and restaurant reviews as part of his job (he’s no precious foodie, either). Nor were we ever exercise freaks – my brothers played football, but we three girls only did PE when at school. At that time (and, at times, still today) sporty girls were infra-dig, so we didn’t want to be like that. It’s a pity, because – for instance – when I was at a co-ed school after passing my 11­plus, I really enjoyed swimming. But when I then transferred to an all girls’ school (because it was Catholic, which my mother was), and swimming was seen less positively. That’s stayed with me all my life, which I’m sorry about. If I had my time again, I’d embrace swimming (I have tried in later years, but something’s always happened to stop my continued attendance at swimming classes). I loved hockey, too, but never pursued it. Ditto, tennis. Again, if I had my time again… However, walking has always been important. And, because my husband and I never owned a car until two years ago (despite him being a travel writer – we used public transport and taxis most of the time), we’ve always done a lot of walking, for instance from home through woods into town. (You mention ethnicity in the question – interestingly, in India, which we visit regularly, we’ve been told that only poor people walk, because they can’t afford transport. However, we have seen lots of rather chubby and very middle-class Indians ‘power-walking’ – though some of it is gentle strolling – through Lodhi Gardens in Delhi). I’ve done yoga as well, since my early 20s, with occasional lapses – but I’ve continued that during lockdown, via Zoom. At times, I’ve joined a gym, but I’ve always been rather half-hearted about it – at one, there was so much testosterone from the male gym-goers, it nearly knocked me out when I entered the building; at another, there was half-hour circuit training just for women, which I enjoyed, but then the regular bus service from my house to the gym became very irregular and, without a car, I lost heart. I was attending U3A keep fit classes for 18 months up to the pandemic, but of course that finished then, and the gym owner had to close down eventually as she could no longer afford to keep the building or pay the trainers. I did have a phone call yesterday with another gym, and have signed up for a half-hour free Zoom class – but I have to say I find the owner’s online personal statement rather offputting, eg “TheSmallgymwithaBIGheartismybrandsoul essenceandoneevenatthischallengingtimeismypassion.”Oh,dear… Do youthink your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Answer: I guess I’ve answered that above? When I worked at a university, I did have an annual ‘wellness’ check-up, which was useful. But I left there 18 months ago, and haven’t signed up for a similar check-up anywhere else. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Answer: I can’t think of a time when I wouldn’t have known about health. Wellbeing, though, would have come a lot later – maybe when I started yoga in my early 20s, or even later than that? Now, I do Mindfulness as well as yoga – and I do get a bit irritated when I read articles about yoga where the writer is reinventing the wheel, talking about the mental and physical benefits of yoga. Well, yes, that’s why it’s been around for thousands of years.. I also get irritated when the accompanying photos are of fit young women in leotards doing impossible feats. My fellow yoga practitioners have always been people (mainly women) in their 30s, 30s, 50s up to 80s, with real bodies encased in whatever teousers/leggings and tee-shirts are handy. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Answer: My parents and my schools. At primary school, we had a school nurse. Obviously, we always had a doctor as well, who would come to see us when we had measles, mumps, whatever (we lived in the country in my very early years). At primary school, we had daily school milk (a third of a pint) and orange juice, regular check-ups. Mum gave us cod liver oil on a regular basis (I still take it). At grammar school, we would have had lessons about health – wellbeing was taken care of in RE. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversationstake place? Answer: The short answer, I’m afraid, is no. They must have done – they were very caring and responsible parents -but I don’t remember them. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Answer: Again, my memory is rather vague – well, it’s a long time ago. I imagine I would have talked about it with friends – though, in the 1960s, I really don’t remember us talking much about anyone’s mental health. We may well have called someone ‘a bit odd’ or ‘she’s a bit strange/nervous’, but we wouldn’t have spent time talking about panic attacks or anxiety or depression. Nor would we have talked about ‘eating disorders’ – ‘she’s very picky’ is probably what we would have said. I’ve discussed all this with old schoolfriends, two of whom are now grandmothers, and we all agree on that. But we would have talked amongst ourselves, and checked out magazines like Jackie and Petticoat – and, later, Cosmopolitan – and got health tips from those. In fact, I used to cut things out and store them – things about losing weight and keeping clean – but more physical health information than mental health. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Answer: I have an older sister, and remember when I first realised she was ‘developing’ (she’d have been around 11, me about 9) and I blurted out, ‘R’s got breasts!’ She went bright red and ran out of the room, and my mother told me off for embarrassing her. I didn’t realise it was something to be embarrassed about. At our Roman Catholic convent grammar school, it was the RE teacher who seemed to have responsibility for teaching us about puberty, etc. Well, her and books such as My Dear Daughter, which was written by nuns in Liverpool, and told us not to be ashamed by bodily changes at this time – “Because remember, Our Lady too had a body like yours”. It also told us that, when washing ourselves in the bath, if we had ‘bad’ thoughts when washing our ‘private parts’, we should offer up a prayer to Our Lady, to save us from sin. As for periods/menstruation – again, my older sister got there first, but it was all very hush-hush (we had three younger brothers, and these things were definitely to be kept from them). Mum used to just give her sanitary towels when they were needed. When I started to bleed, I was upset and told my mother, who supplied me with the STs, too, and told me how often to change them, how to dispose of them. ‘Can I still go swimming?’ I asked her. Rather sharply, she replied, ‘Of course you can – you’re not an invalid, you know!’ I remember feeling that was unjust – how did I know, when she’d never told me about the facts of life? It wasn’t her fault, I know – she had six children, not much money, a lot to think about, her own difficult childhood and adolescence. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? Answer: I can only talk from my own perspective and experience. Growing up, my sister and I both wore lace-up bodices underneath our dresses or blouses. I’ve mentioned the first period above, but can add to that by saying that our RE teacher, Miss W, told us (in the lesson about periods) that, when she first ‘came on’ (though she didn’t use that phrase) her father bought her flowers to celebrate her first steps on the road to womanhood. My friends and I found that quite cheesey. For me, it was something to hide. So, when I was having my period, I would secrete a sanitary pad inside the waistband of my school skirt, hoping it wouldn’t fall out. That way, I could ask to go to the toilet without having to take my satchel with me, as a giveaway. Other girls must have been doing the same, given the very low number of girls who’d rush out of the room to the toilet carrying a bag of any sort.  One day, in the changing rooms after swimming, a particularly coarse classmate came up behind me, touched my leg with her finger and showed it to me, bloodied. ‘Ooh, look, C’s come on,’ she laughed. I knew I hadn’t – my period had started by then, but had finished the week before. So I just gave her a withering glance. In fact, she’d nicked her finger and made it bleed. But she liked embarrassing other girls that way – and in other ways. As for bras, I can’t remember my first one, though it would have been soft cotton and not very supportive. It took me a while to develop properly, whereas my older sister was more ‘mature’ earlier. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Answer: I think I’ve answered these above. It did become important to shave legs once they started to grow hair. It was very uncool to have hairy legs, or hairy underarms. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Answer: I’ve been blessed with a very equitable personality. I’m not breezy, certainly don’t take my mental health for granted, but in a family where both parents had anxiety (hardly surprising, given their lack of money, six children and homes that came with the job) and where two siblings are on medication for anxiety/depression, and a third has also suffered from depression – I count my blessings every day that I didn’t inherit the depressive gene. So I’ve never had to seek counselling or therapy or medication for anything related to mental health. I’ve done yoga since my 20s, Mindfulness meditation for the past 12 years, have studied Buddhism (as a non-Buddhist) also since my 20s. Growing up, I prayed (until such time as I parted company with the RC Church – with no animosity, just a gradual slackening and then final cut of the ties that bound me). I’m constantly learning new things, listen to classical music, don’t watch any films or TV programmes that I regard as upsetting/frightening (not since Clockwork Orange when I was 20 – that was the clincher). I’m an optimist, positive, find much to laugh at (and my husband makes me laugh, a lot). All of that helps, as does regular walking, an appreciation of nature, very occasional jaunts over the years into something more organised/strenuous, such as keep fit or swimming classes. I drink too much and eat too many sweet things, but I’ve been vegetarian for 30+ years, take cod liver oil, Vitamin C tabs, Vitamin D tabs, Visionace for my eyes, Amlodipine for my high blood pressure, and drink a lot of water throughout the day. I make sure I have regular dental check-ups, regular cervical smear tests and mammograms, and see the doctor about anything that bothers me. Apart from drinking too much, I do my best… Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? My sisters have kept me informed about health during the pandemic. I just absorb things from different sources. I don’t actively go looking for information, I’m not neurotic about my health, don’t Google things. I work on the premise that as doctors and dentists undergo around seven years of training, plus lifelong learning, that’s their area of expertise, not mine (or Google’s). I don’t expect a doctor to be able to make a radio programme, so why should I expect to be able to diagnose – and cure -cancer? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I’m aware that my body is now 67 years old, and therefore not as nice to look at as it was even five years ago. There’s some strange puckering around the navel (because my stomach muscles are so not toned) and my breasts not only sag a bit but are also getting a bit wrinkly. I know I don’t do enough toning exercise, but comfort myself with the knowledge that I do walk, do yoga and climb up and down 50 stairs each day, many times. So I don’t feel too bad about my body. It still works, and can still look good clothed. Plus, as my husband often tells me, it’s cuddly at night. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I don’t know. I guess, in my head, I’m always thinking I should go back to keep fit classes, the gym, tone myself more. But I’m just not that bothered that I want to devote time to that – certainly not to a gym (unless it’s for U3A people) – that could otherwise be spent walking in the countryside or just doing more interesting things. But then, in my head, I’m still 18-going-on-52, not 67. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? My immediate response is to say that a healthy person looks ‘better’ than an unhealthy one. There can be external signs of un-health: people being overweight, people with ‘smokers’ faces (sucked-in cheeks, lines around the mouth), people who have obvious physical problems, eg moving slowly and painfully around on sticks, people whose health is affected by poverty and poor education. Someone whose wellbeing is good may look calm, serene. But even as I write all of that, I imagine I’m being judgmental… Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Haven’t we all? I was a teenager in the 60s, when Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton were the role models – both gorgeous, both extremely slender, one with an androgynous look, the other definitely feminine. My friends and I loved those looks, aspired to them even though we didn’t live in London and couldn’t afford the clothes. So we made a lot of them ourselves. I do think now, though, that it’s like an epidemic – a lot of young women (I’ve seen this so often amongst my students) never feel they’re thin enough, or pretty enough, or pouty enough or false-eyelashed enough; girls who spend their time on Instagram, looking at impossible physical ‘ideals’. Some of those ideals – Kim Kardashian’s buttocks or breasts, for instance, or Botoxed lips – just look absurd to me, like something that should be in a fairground Freak Show. But what do I know – I’m in my 60s. I remember once, being on a train from Manchester to Sheffield, and sitting opposite a beautiful, fresh-and-freckled,  Scandinavian-looking blonde woman in her early 20s. To my horror, all the way from Manchester, she expertly applied the slap, transforming herself from a natural beauty into A N Other bit of street totty. I so wanted to stop her and say, ‘Don’t! You’re so lovely anyway – you don’t need all this make-up!’ But it was a packed train, and there were men on either side of us – and she didn’t make any eye contact. She got off at Sheffield, and I was all set to say it to her then, but her boyfriend came to join her, so the moment passed. But that horrible transformation from beauty to mask has really stayed with me. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My Dad – who was born in 1916 – liked women (and men) to take pride in their appearance. For men – no slouching around, hands in pockets, unpolished shoes, sloppy long hair. He found the 1960s a bit trying in that respect. For women, he liked ‘a well-turned ankle’, good legs, a little make-up but not too much. My Mum (born 1923) had little time to worry much about make-up, and little money to worry much about posh frocks (she had six children). But she was always clean, tidy, and made the most of herself on the little money she had – the occasional neat suit with defined waist, nice dresses, smart hats for weddings, etc. She was very good-looking when young – as indeed was my father – and they were of a generation where it was important to keep up appearances. Right up to when she died aged 92, she always looked lovely, with fluffy white hair and a taste for pretty pastel colours, good affordable dresses. When we were growing up, it was very important to her to turn us all out neatly and cleanly. And she herself could rise to every occasion – when she and my older sister went to a Queen’s Garden Party for former Land Army Girls, she wore a big posh hat and a matching lilac-coloured suit, smart shoes, unsnagged tights, decent handbag, gloves, etc. She was in her 80s at the time. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Make-up, I’m afraid. When the adjoining house to ours caught fire, about eight years ago, I was out in the back garden trying to hose down their conservatory when the fire brigade arrived. We were all told to vacate the house. Outside, the fireman asked where I was. ‘In the kitchen, putting on her make-up,’ said my husband. ‘Could you tell her to come out now,’ the fireman said firmly. ‘Otherwise I’m coming in to get her.’ No-one apart from my husband ever sees me without foundation, eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick. It’s not worth inflicting on other people. So my DID item would be my (full) make-up bag. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, orfor the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? See my brief comment above. At work, Dad was a gardener, so his ‘uniform’ was dungarees and shirt. On the rare occasions they went out, he would put on his tweed jacket, good shirt and tie, polish his shoes (he always polished all our shoes), and Mum would put his best trousers out for him. Mum herself would put a bit of lipstick on, maybe a dab of foundation, and another dab of perfume (nothing expensive as she couldn’t afford it), plus her nice frock, neat shoes and handbag. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? When I was teaching, I’d always do my best to look good for the students. I felt it was so important for them to see that they were valued, worth the effort. Sometimes I’d wear an Indian outfit (salwar kameeze-type) just because I have a few of those. I like long scarves and Indian dupattas, so would probably wear one of those. I love costume jewellery – nothing expensive, mostly bought from charity shops and junk shops – so would always wear a necklace of some sort and bright clip-on earrings. I still like to dress well -even during lockdown I’d sometimes get one of my best outfits from the wardrobe and wear that, even if it was just me and my husband at home. I like dressing up, wearing bright tights or leggings, something a bit Gudrun Sjoden, a bit alternative. My work and socialising routines actually aren’t much different – interesting clothes (I love dresses), bright accessories, make­up, contact lenses if I’m appearing ‘in public’. Plus Chanel No 5 perfume. That’s my one real extravagance. After all, if it was good enough for Marilyn Monroe… ENDS"

Answer: I think I wrote about this in my Coronavirus Diaries for March to June 2020. The pandemic coincided with me leaving my job as a university lecturer, so my life changed then, anyway. I’m very glad I managed to fit in a number of social visits to other places, plus exhibitions, plus lunches with friends, before lockdown in March 2020. They gave me much pleasure to reflect back on. Because time post-March 2020 became so much more fluid, I followed the four principles of Nourish, Connect, Move and Be. I tried to cook every day, contact friends and family, walk and meditate/do yoga every day. Those four pillars provided structure. Writing this now, in June 2021, they still provide structure, though somehow they’ve become less meaningful after all this time, and there are days when everything seems slightly disconcertingly amorphous. It’s very ‘like and not like’ at the moment, as we all wait – an extra month now – for the final restrictions to be lifted. I’ve started arranging more social events now, including short breaks away and more exhibitions, in order to motivate myself more.   In the first days of the lockdown, did your daily rhythms, routines, or habits change? If so, please say how and describe how this felt. Can you recall how these changes came about? Were they connected to specific government regulation or advice?  Answer: Again, I think I’ve already written about this, but I’ll try and add more. At first, it was all so strange, so dislocated, it took time for the changes to really take hold – both in reality and in the psyche. It was hard to take everything seriously at first, so there was a gradual dawning of this ‘new reality’. And, knowing that everyone else was sharing that reality was reassuring. It wasn’t just us missing out – everyone was missing out. So that whole FOMO thing disappeared. I’d sit by the front bedroom window doing some mending (something I hadn’t done for YEARS) and see hardly anyone on the streets. Few cars, very few pedestrians, no cyclists – except when people did their allotted hour’s exercise outdoors, or crept along to the shops. It was all most odd.   In what ways have different aspects of your life sped up or slowed down? For example, have you been furloughed from work or taken on caring responsibilities? Maybe you’ve been studying online or have taken up new hobbies. Please describe your experience of this.   Answer: In those early days, I think there was a lot of enthusiasm for learning new things. Many of us (though by no means all) turned to online classes (in my case, Adriene’s Yoga and a Yale University Introduction to Classical Music course), thought what fun it would be to learn Norwegian via FutureLearn (15 months on, I still haven’t), discovered the joys and pitfalls of Zoom, embraced the new world order as much as we could. But, 15 months on, it’s definitely palled. I think a world weariness began to descend the more we all realised that life would never get back to the way it was in 2019. It takes some getting used to, making plans to see friends for coffee or lunch and then remembering that you have to book a table, wear a mask when not sitting at the table, sanitise every time you go into a different building, keep a distance, do Track & Trace, etc, etc. Life definitely did slow down – and not just because I gave up work six weeks before the pandemic. I think it slowed down for a lot of people – hence the number of cyclists we still see in the valley outside our house. I imagine a lot of those are still working, and using the valley to de-stress at the start or end of the day. We never saw so many cyclists, leisure walkers and runners in the valley before. I guess it’s the new gym, only healthier and much nicer. You don’t see many hares in PureGym.  Many people have spent more time than usual in their local environments. If this is the case for you, have you noticed anything in particular about the rhythms of the environment round you, such as the timing of seasons, plants, animals, the sun and the moon?  Answer: I’ve pretty much answered this in the paragraph above – and, at much more length, in my March-June 2020 Coronavirus Diaries. It’s been wonderful having the countryside on our doorstep. We’ve always appreciated it, but never more so than this past year. We’ve been very aware of the cycle of life, amongst plants, birds and other wildlife, like hares. We’ve seen more of the cycle of death, too, having seen a young dove on a branch one day, dead yet unscathed by the side of the road the next. Same with one of the hares we’d quite possibly seen eating gracefully in a field – there one day, the next squashed by a car. We buried them under leaves, along with a beautiful dead goldfinch. So our valley walk is now full of those memories, too.   Are your rhythms and routines changing again now? If so, in what ways? Do you anticipate them changing again in the future? If so, please describe how you feel about this?  Answer: I appreciate that the directive was written for Summer 2020 and I’m only now answering it, in Summer 2021, so my answer may well be redundant. But yes, the rhythms and routines of life have subtly changed throughout the past year. I know my experience is at odds with so many people, whose lives have been turbulent this past year. But I really enjoyed much of the first year, because it was a shared experience, not just in the UK but around the world. No-one escaped the rules and regulations. Many people didn’t escape death or serious illness, job losses, mental health agonies, the mega-frustrations of living in cramped conditions – not so cramped when you could leave them for hours at a time to go into an office or factory, but noticeably so when you were confined to home for so long, possibly working at home with a partner, trying to live and work in a relatively small space for months and months. For me and my husband, though (whose travel writing career has now receded into memory, in part thanks to the pandemic, but actually coinciding with his inner desire to stop being on the move so much), it’s been a real chance to reflect back on a pretty rich and varied working life. And to do so not just through conversation, but also by sitting down at our attic desks and writing up all those memories in book form. That’s something we would never have got round to doing, had we both been working, and had the pandemic not happened. Now, though, in June 2021, reflecting back on the past few months, there are times when I have felt bored with the same-old-same-old, and when my motivation has slumped, leaving me feeling a bit aimless and lacking in energy. So we recently had a few days away in Northamptonshire, which was a real energy boost. But I slumped again a few days later – and booked to see an exhibition here in Sheffield, forcing myself to go into the city centre. Ironically, the exhibition was Cecil Beaton’s photographs of the Bright Young Things of the 1920s and 1930s – which made emerging into the desolate landscape of the city centre even more stark. Now, to try and pretend this continuing ‘normality’ (which so patently isn’t) is how life is always going to be, I’ve been booking a couple of other trips away, a couple of other exhibitions. But in some ways that makes the contrast between the old, 2019 normality and today’s ‘normality’ also starker. Bloody face masks, bloody hand sanitisers, bloody QR codes for Track and Trace and for looking at café menus. Bloody bloody.   Homelife For those of you spending most of your time at home, how do you make distinctions between different times of the day? Do you describe these times – to yourself or members of your household - in any new ways since lockdown? For example, do you have particular times of the day you leave the house to take a walk or have meals? What factors influence the organisation of your time?  Answer: This has changed over the past year, depending on the official restrictions. But I guess, looking back, we tried our best to start the day with a walk and, when we were allowed to, to finish the ‘working’ day with a walk, too. We still get up before 7am, as we always have done; still try to incorporate a daily walk, often after breakfast, at other times at 5/6pm. I’ve just seen my neighbours across the road leave home together, presumably for an evening stroll. He looked pretty fed-up – I think he probably suffers from his nerves, anyway (to use an old-fashioned phrase), and he’s had to cope with a lot this past year – redundancy, then a new job, working from home alongside his wife, at times having to home school two primary-age daughters. It really can’t have been easy for them, though his wife has always put on a brave face. To get back to the questions: we’ve always followed a regular breakfast/lunch/dinner routine. I’ve tried to follow the Nourish/Move/Connect/Be structure mentioned before, though not always in the same order. I’ve tried to ensure that I’ve done larger productive things during the day – writing, for instance, as well as mending a bedspread… I’ve also tried to contact a friend or family member most days, by email/text/Zoom/phone call. After a lifetime of working, I didn’t/don’t want to just drop out of the world. And, as I’ve always been well-organised, I’ve needed to remain that way even during a pandemic. There have been a couple of days when I’ve just thought, sod it, I’m going back to bed, so I’ve done that (once was the day after my 2nd vaccine dose, and I still can’t decide whether it was an after-effect of the jab or an excuse to be lazy and have my husband bring me lunch in bed).  For those of you living in households with others, how do you negotiate time in relation to one another? Do some people’s time matter more than others? Is this determined by work, caring responsibilities or maybe access to computers?  Answer: This hasn’t been a problem with us at all. There’s only my husband and myself, and – as we’ve always worked from home as journalists - we’ve always had our own offices in the two attic rooms. So we’re incredibly lucky in that we haven’t had to negotiate access to computers, the internet, desks, etc. We’ve noticed that there’s been heavier usage of the internet, so at times it’s been unstable, but most of the time we’ve then just switched to working on something not internet-related (or switching everything off and on again).  Just to veer slightly off the subject here, and bringing someone else’s experience in: my niece and her fiancé both work for the same upmarket travel company and live together in a one-bedroom flat in London. When the pandemic hit, their company had to shed staff – around 30 people lost their jobs. Thankfully, my niece and her fiancé kept theirs, though they were very sad to see close colleagues go. Then they were furloughed, which meant a reduction in income, plus losing their annual bonuses for two years running. From Spring 2020, they were working from home. At Christmas 2020, they decided to go and stay at my sister’s 4-bedroomed house in the Midlands countryside. They stayed for five months – their computers stacked on the dining-room table, separate kitchen, living-room, conservatory, plenty of space to walk around indoors, lovely gardens outside, surrounded by countryside where they could walk and cycle whenever they felt like it. Three weeks ago, they decided to go back to London as their bosses were working out how and when to re-open a physical office. Within the first week, my niece was texting her mother to say her mental health was plummeting. It’s not got any better – she’s been signed off work for a fortnight, and is in the process of seeking psychiatric help (she’s suffered from anxiety and depression for many years but was coping really well before the pandemic). So they are now planning to move back to my sister’s and stay for as long as they can. As she’s been telling my sister, the whole business of two of them working from a one-bedroom flat with computers on the table in the living-room, where they also eat, watch TV, etc, meant that she felt the four walls were closing in on her. There was no separation from work and home life, nowhere to really escape to. How often must that have been replicated around the country? In what ways have your lives come to be ‘in synch’ with or at odds with one another over the period of lockdown?  Answer: We’ve always spent a lot of time together, even when we were at our working busiest, with my husband abroad on Press trips and/or me criss-crossing the country to record interviews for radio features. The only thing I would say is that, much as I love him, there have been times when I could have done/could still do with a bit of headspace. I’ve only taken myself off on solo walks a few times over the past year, but I’ve started seeing people for coffee on my own (he’s not bothered about even that level of socialising at the moment), and that’s been good. Thankfully, we’re true companions – but even true companions need a break every now and then… What changes do you anticipate in the time of your homelife in the future?  Answer: Again, this isn’t particularly relevant to me/us, especially at a time when I know couples who’ve been thrown together all day through home working, and/or are sharing their homes with grown-up children they’d hoped would fly the nest some time ago. I’d just like to have more friends coming round now for meals, and being able to go to theirs…  Media and technology Have media and technologies featured in any daily life changes – for example, speaking to family or colleagues using online tools, having online medical appointments and/or shopping online? If so, has using these tools made a difference to how you manage, schedule or plan your time?   Answer: Yes is the short answer to this.  My sister set up a family WhatsApp group, which I finally left three months ago because I was finding my sister-in-law’s narcissism, fuelled by my sister’s overt admiration, pretty tow-curling. I had hoped I could just slope off without anyone knowing, but it seems that’s not possible, so I had to just leave. I’ve had regular Zoom sessions with my two sisters – at one point, again, we tried a whole family thing, but that didn’t work. One brother and sister-in-law were too distracted by their disabled son, so left after the first get-together (that same sister-in-law also left the family WhatsApp in a pretty tactless huff); another brother and sister-in-law admitted they found the whole Zoom thing of people talking over each other too competitive, so they then bowed out; so then there were five of us, with my brother and above-mentioned sister-in-law dominating; so then I temporarily bowed out, to see if a smaller number worked better, but the remaining brother and my middle sister then had a Zoom falling out, so he left in mid-conversation. So it’s back to a weekly Zoom with the three sisters, which works just fine – though we occasionally have to postpone because the youngest sister has spent too much time staring at a screen (she’s an FE tutor). I/we also Zoom friends – when my husband takes part because we’re talking to another couple, we both agree afterwards that it’s not a bad substitute for having a proper meal with them, and we don’t have to either cook or leave the house. It will be very nice, though, when we can start going round to other people’s houses for a meal and have them round at ours. And be able to talk naturally, rather than in the sometimes dislocated and dislocating way of Zoom.  I’m doing an awful lot more shopping online than I did before, especially supermarket shopping – roughly speaking, we have a Morrisons delivery once every 5-6 weeks, alternating with a Sainsburys one. And, because so many shops were closed/disconcertingly busy/in the ever more depressing city centre during lockdown, I’ve done more and more shopping online, for things like books & household items. I hate having to do this in one way, but I found supermarket shopping (my main shopping experience) this past year has made me feel quite fraught, with the result that I’ve got flurried at the checkout and then worried that I’ve forgotten to pick up my debit card or purse or keys. It’s no longer an enjoyable experience, so it’s simpler to do it in the comfort of my own home – now I’ve cracked it. And the delivery drivers are always really nice, too. The online medical appointments haven’t been bad, though I’d hate to think they might become routine. Our surgery is very good, and when my husband needed to speak to a consultant about his osteoarthritic knees, the doctor referred him, and he did have a physical appointment with the consultant. He’s had two or three other phone call consultations – fortunately for nothing major. I can’t imagine how it feels when you’re really suffering or worried/frightened about a condition and can’t actually get to see a doctor or nurse. It must be awful. It doesn’t surprise me, therefore, that people shout and swear at receptionists. I’m not for a minute condoning it – it’s hardly the receptionists’ fault - but I can see how it happens. On a couple of occasions, we’ve had to send photos of an injury or new condition to the surgery. Again, not perfect, but they’ve been very good at then getting a doctor to phone us back and discuss it. As for dentists – we’ve somehow managed to see a dentist a few times over the past year, for toothache or a filling falling out. They’ve been excellent. Oh, and the opticians – I went to the one down the road for new glasses, and because I had to wear a mask while there, I was allowed to bring a few different frames home with me to try on. That was a boon. Did other materials – for example, notepads, diaries, wall calendars – feature as well? What did you use them for?   Answer: As journalists, we’ve always used notepads, diaries and wall calendars. I have a Quo Vadis diary with columns for each day of the particular week, and I still fill those in assiduously, even though now, instead of ‘To Liverpool with Roger McGough to record’ or ‘To Manchester to mix programme with studio manager’ or ‘programme editing’ or ‘prepare lecture’ – it’s more like ‘washing & ironing… yoga x 2…spring-clean our bedroom…window-cleaner comes…’  If you used new media, technologies or materials, or changed how you used them as a result of COVID-19, do you anticipate that you will keep using them in the same way in the future? The Spring Directive included a similar question. If you answered it, have your views changed?  Answer: I’ll be using Zoom for the foreseeable future. It means I can connect with friends in other parts of my city, or other parts of the country, or in the US/Saudi Arabia/wherever. I’m currently working on a couple of talks I’m hoping to deliver to a conference via Zoom – and I’m struggling with getting the audio clips to work properly. I can hear them loud and clear, but when I’ve played them via Zoom to my sister in another part of my city, they sound muffled. So that’s something I’m trying to sort out now. My former university colleagues have all taught via Zoom, and got their heads around other learning tools – as has my sister, who teaches in an FE college. So yes, I do anticipate using some of these tools beyond the pandemic.  Waiting For some people, it seems as if life has been put ‘on hold’ during the pandemic. Does this feel relevant to you? If so, please say how. Have you experienced a particular pause or a delay, for instance in waiting for appointments, activities, a new job or for work to resume?   Answer: Again, because I left work just before the pandemic, life was always going to be different from February 2020. But yes, although we’ve pretty much glided through the past year, keeping busy and well occupied, aspects of life have still been put ‘on hold’. Just before March 2020, for instance, we were visiting family and friends in other parts of the country. We’d have continued with that, had we been able to, which we weren’t. We’re slowly making plans to do so again – so long as the government stops its destructive stop-start policy. Had it not been for the pandemic, I’d have met more friends for coffee/lunch, gone to more exhibitions and the occasional theatre show, gone to stay with friends and family in Birmingham/Broadstairs/other parts of Kent/London. We’d have had short breaks in different places, too – the south coast, perhaps – and holidays in Orkney and quite possible the US, where we have friends, and/or another trip to India, which we’ve visited most years for the past 25 years. But we couldn’t – and no-one could (unless they were in Government, of course, where a different set of rules seems to apply). As for the other part of the question – appointments, etc – well, I reckon my husband might have pursued the knee operation option had that been viable. Activities – I was attending, and very much enjoying, a U3A keep-fit class, which had to stop. After a few months, the owner decided she couldn’t afford to re-open, so that all went by the board, which was a great shame, as the other people were lovely, and I felt it was very good for me. So that’s been a loss. But it’s all frippery compared to so many other people’s experiences.  What is your experience of waiting? For example, you may have spent time queuing outside shops, waiting for deliveries, or waiting to see friends or family. Please describe how these times felt.  Answer: The waiting-to-see-friends-and-family is pretty much covered above. We have seen my sister in Leicestershire, but can’t stay with her as she’s been shielding since March 2020 and, when her daughter and fiancé lived with them, they did regular Covid tests in order to do so, which my husband isn’t prepared to do (and I’m not keen). So, although we’ve visited them, we’ve not been able to stay at their house, and I don’t know when we will be allowed back in. We’ve got a friend coming to stay from Birmingham next week, and don’t really have any concerns about that. My other sister has also stayed overnight a couple of times since March 2020 – she lives in the same city as us and is our ‘bubble’. We’re also hoping to stay with London friends in August, fingers crossed. All these things we used to take for granted, but now you have to check how comfortable the other people are with the arrangements. Deliveries haven’t been a problem, as we hardly ever used online shopping before. When I first tried to organise deliveries online, it was a bit stressful as everyone else had the same idea, so there were no/very few slots left. But that’s eased considerably over the past 9/10 months, and is now quite easy to arrange. The queuing outside shops thing is a bore – and another reason to shop online. I find it quite stressful and irritating, having to wait outside – though, having said that, there’s never really been any hard or fast rule. People queue outside out little local Co-op even when there are no customers inside, because the notice instructs you to wait for someone to come out before you go in, and people don’t think sensibly. The bakery limits inside customers to 2 at any one time, which is the norm for the greengrocers, too, and usually no problem. Ditto the hardware store. Where it does seem to have been a problem in the past is the big supermarkets like massive Lidl or Aldi stores, but we don’t shop there, anyway, so that’s fine. Our nearest Sainsburys doesn’t have any limitations on customers inside, whilst the neighbouring Morrisons does, but it’s not usually a problem – and there are security guards there to tell you when you can enter. So – it’s a bore, and I wish it would end soon, but it’s not been a massive inconvenience.   For those who have been directly or indirectly affected by illness during the pandemic, how have you experienced time and waiting in particular in relation to incapacity, recovery, loss and grief?  Answer: This hasn’t happened to us, or to anyone close to us, thank God. Long may that continue.   ENDS"

The Covid 19 Vaccine I have had two Pfizer vaccinations against Covid 19 I had estimated that I would be in Group 5 of the 9 priority groups. My doctorâ€™s surgery phoned while Group 4 was still being vaccinated in this area and asked me if I would like the vaccination. â€˜Yes pleaseâ€™ was my immediate response. Two days later I attend the vaccination centre. I had to walk into the village, then catch a bus into the nearest town. The centre was in rooms under the football stadium. So it was somewhere new to me, though I had seen this stadium from a distance. It was a very icy day in February. I decided to wear hiking boots, thick pink walking socks, very warm clothes and hat. The village was very quiet but the buses were running. There were very few passengers. I then had to walk across a park, after which there were volunteers in tabards to direct all comers round the outside of the stadium and into the section being used as the vaccination centre. There were more volunteers than people attending to be vaccinated, but I saw on the regional news that evening that a new vaccination centre had opened that day in the very middle of the urban area. This would be more accessible. It was very well organised. It took a few minutes to give my details and to be given a brochure about possible after effects. There was no wait for the vaccinator. I presumed he was a doctor acting part-time. The staff changed while I was waiting for 15 minutes after my vaccination. I then had to catch a bus to the bus station in the city centre. Then I caught an empty bus back to the village. The city was curious. Almost all premises had shutters down and the streets were deserted. I was pleased to receive the vaccine. I was surprised when the doctorâ€™s surgery phoned to ask me if I could go at short notice for my second vaccine. When she told me where it was I exclaimed, â€™Whereâ€™s that?â€™ So she gave me the post code and I said I would find it. Google is a wonderful tool for street map, street view and the bus timetable as the vaccination centre was at a doctorâ€™s surgery on the far side of the nearest town. So I listed out all the bus stops and landmarks on a piece of paper and set off to walk to the village. I had to catch a bus into the city centre bus station and then another bus out east. I was almost the only passenger. The driver was very helpful and pointed out where the surgery was. When I arrived it was a large modern surgery. There were many volunteers in tabards marshalling all comers for vaccine into two long socially spaced queues round the outside of the building. Cars were queuing to enter the car park. Other marshalls were finding wheelchairs and seats.  It gave an impression of the great scale of the vaccination campaign. But the queue moved very briskly and I was ushered into a room with a clerk and a nurse who exclaimed about how far I had come. I can only presume they had spare vaccines and my doctorâ€™s surgery had phoned round to find a few people so none would be wasted. Had I any concerns about the Pfizer vaccine? No, I was pleased to be vaccinated and amazed to be invited ahead of time. All vaccines have risks. I am old enough to remember having smallpox vaccine and other vaccines. The risks from the disease are much greater. I am still following government guidelines. If I go out I wear a mask and follow social spacing. I am still inclined to stay at home and just to go out to shop for food weekly and to change library books. I shall continue to do this for a few more weeks B6659 to ensure the vaccination effect is at its full strength. I have a wish list of things I hope to do and people I hope to see if the pandemic dies down. But I am in no rush. I am not sure how the entire vaccination programme is being rolled out locally. Some people I know have been to their doctorâ€™s surgery. Some have been to the local hospital. Some have gone to the stadium, or to the City Hall. It has been following the sequence of key workers and age cohorts. My information has come from the government Covid updates and the Times. I do not engage with social media and people I know have merely reported that they have had their first jab, or second jab. I am a bit concerned about those who do not wish to be vaccinated. The risk is that they will prolong the epidemic and allow the development of variants. I wonder whether it is age related. The historic position is that humans died of diseases. Then smallpox and more and more other vaccines were developed. Younger cohorts have grown up not remembering serious diseases, epidemics, the risk of death and serious after effects of disease. I think vaccine passports would be sensible for foreign travel. I still have an old international smallpox vaccination certificate from 1973 when there was an outbreak in Harrow. There are still such certificates for diseases such as yellow fever. The form of the certificate needs to be standardized as quickly as possible. I am considering laminating the little card with my vaccine details in case it is ever needed as I do not carry a smartphone. But in general I think Britain has never asked people to carry identification papers, except in wartime, so I would not support a proof of vaccination certificate for domestic use. I do not think vaccination should be mandatory but I think time and effort should be put into convincing the vaccine-shy of the science and their civic responsibility. Covid vaccination does not even leave a scar. Social media platforms should be fined if they allow misleading â€˜informationâ€™ to be circulated. Smallpox vaccination reached very high levels in the past and outbreaks tended to be among travelling populations, or children who had not had to prove vaccination status to enter a state primary school. This was by vaccination scar, not paperwork. Vaccination protected the whole population. If the levels of vaccination for covid are not high enough it may be necessary to recreate the system of local isolation hospitals, as in the past, and to keep the local authority tracing teams well funded. This may be necessary as even if covid 19 is controlled it is unlikely to be the last virus threat."

I keep an annual scrapbook. I decided to include all cancelled tickets. All parish events and services were cancelled and the church was locked. Appointments were put on hold for the dentist and optician. Planned visits to York to meet friends were cancelled from 16th March onwards. Only half the usual numbers came to the embroidery society meeting on Saturday 14th March. The committee decided by e-mail to go ahead and spaced the chairs out as it was likely that older members would have decided to self-isolate and would not attend. Then the committee decided by e-mail to suspend meetings, cancel speakers and the hall and to keep the website active. A friend was abroad, e-mailed when government first daily announcement. She managed to get a flight home before borders closed at the other end. She sounded very glad that she was allowed into the country at Heathrow. A son and his wife started working from home in London. The primary school and nursery closed on Friday 20th March and I e-mailed some attachments of craft ideas. Another son had annual leave from his employment but all plans were cancelled, including his local rambling club, and he had to potter around his flat. Many people I know had booked holidays and had to discuss cancellation and future rebooking of holidays. I know one person whose son came home from a teaching job, for brief annual leave at Chinese New Year, and then could not return as China shut down. I know one person with family in North Italy who was due to fly out to visit but Italy shut down. One person’s husband died from a long standing condition. Many people had planned to attend the funeral but the plans went through many stages of change within a week. Relatives could not fly in. Then the parish worried about the problem of large numbers standing far enough apart. And so on, and so on until the day. Then the church was locked. I notice that Brexit has disappeared from the news. The parish officers embarked on a campaign to make sure we were in touch by e­mail or telephone with all the congregation of the parish church. This was complicated as some elderly people were not on e-mail. A weekly e-magazine was set up. Have you been ill? On Monday 16th March I feared was going to have appendicitis. This had gone by the next day. On Tuesday 17th March I had an incipient headache, felt muzzy, cough, pain in left side, short of breath, sore throat, but no temperature. Still muzzy on Wednesday. Then I only had the cough and felt very tired if I tried to do a bit more. I stayed in for 7 days until Monday 23rd March when I needed milk and fruit. While ill I really wanted to go to bed and sleep but I decided it would be better to get up, walk about, walk up and down stairs and stand rather than sit. I had to drink more than usual. In retrospect I hope it was a mild case of coronavirus so I will be immune. I could not collect library books during that week. But I managed to collect books on the day the library closed. I kept the windows open and drank tea outside in the garden. Fortunately it was fine and mild. I felt much better outside in the sun and with a slight breeeze. I found I was looking forward to slices of cucumber, or radishes, or Bramley apple. I found a war time delight in finding items in the store cupboard which I had overlooked. After 10 days the cough got worse and after outdoor exercise I was very tired. I went out on a circuit round the village and then had to abandon my outside exercise hour for a few days, to recover. Then I improved but had very little appetite for a week or more. Despite setting fixed times for meals I lost ½ stone. 2. Are you doing anything to protect yourself or others from Coronavirus? Before 15th March I wore gloves for all outside activities in the weeks before 15th March. I went upstairs on the bus to Hull and travelled at a quiet time. Most people were elderly and went downstairs. I opened the windows upstairs. I did not attend the governors meeting at a local school on Wednesday 18th March as I was coughing and feared I had the virus. I cancelled visit to eldest son. Used e-mail to contact people in the village, instead of seeing people. After 15th March I have been outside the garden twice each week to shop for food – once for milk, and once for everything else. I combine trike rides for exercise with shopping in the village. I do gardening on sunny mild days. There is so little traffic that one pedestrian will walk in the road when approaching someone else from the other direction. The supermarkets have marked spots to stand in a queue outside, have a set route round the shelves, and have marked spacing at the tills. It is all very polite and silent. Washing hands carefully, as the first action after opening the door and again after unpacking groceries. I found the skin on my hands becoming very dry and I started to wonder whether it was a side-effect of the virus. Then I decided I was washing my hands more than usual. E45 cured the problem. Have you self-isolated? To a great extent. I had a last hurrah. I went to lecture at History Centre in Hull ( which I cannot usually attend ), went into local primary school to help with Sports Relief activities, went by bus to another village to collect an embroidery from the framers, went to the monthly embroidery society, went into Hull to Tesco, went to Beverley to deal with things in case I had to stay in for a period. I wanted to prepare as I saw how matters were progressing in Italy and France. But I did not foresee lock-down. I regretted not purchasing Hilary Mantel’s new book when I went into Hull. I had intended to purchase it to read on a planned stay in London, which had to be cancelled. But then a son sent Hilary Mantel’s book by Amazon. I had a distant conversation with the courier. He wanted my name, but did not require me to sign. I was in the garden and I warned him that I had a cough. He left the package on the ground. I rationed reading it, hoped it would last for the isolation period but now I have finished it and have re-embarked on the first volume. Have you changed your behaviour? The parish church closed, so we had to develop means to e-mail everyone and send out on-going reports. It was a bit ad hoc to begin with and complicated by GDPR. There was no celebration of Easter. The embroidery society closed for the duration. The committee had to decide by a round of e-mails to cancel speakers, the local hall, day trips and the residential weekend. I began drinking tea outside in the garden if it was fine. Not going to big Sainsburys, or big Tesco in Hull. So choice has become more limited. Also one cannot browse. One has to write a list in shelf order. Otherwise one feels one is delaying the person following. I have not seen my family at all. Creating a regime Listen to Radio 4 news. Get up 7.30am Breakfast, then coffee Wednesday – vegetarian day, Rumpole of the Bailey Thursdays – In Our Time. Friday – fish day Saturdays -muesli breakfast but no walk to the village for the Times. Sunday – no housework Check e-mails and deal with embroidery society, school and parish matters. Check TV and radio schedules and make a list as do not go out to purchase a newspaper. Housework. Make lunch. Drink tea outside. embroidery in another room/ reading upstairs by a window/walk round garden/ etc Gardening Drink tea outside. Make dinner. Watch daily coronavirus update Embroidery while watching Look North TV or radio /telephone calls. Bed 10pm and read in bed for an hour. At first I walked to village for milk/library books etc once weekly. Then, as conditions became stricter I shopped by trike and otherwise stayed at home. Based on a letter in the Times I measured the staircase and embarked on a challenge to equal the height of Everest. I reached Vesuvius by Easter. 3. Have your shopping habits changed? Not for food A son offered to make an on-line order but I said no. Catering for one is easy and I always have stock in case of severe weather. I would have frozen more fruit last Autumn if I had predicted the future. I self isolated because of the cough. When I went shopping in village again I was pleased to find everything well stocked. I missed the panic buying phase. I made sure I had the materials for two big embroidery projects to keep me busy. I decided to go out a minimum amount, once there were cases in Britain. But there must have been silent and widespread cases. No clothes, no shoes, no books, no plants or shrubs, no hair cuts, no buying some food items in one shop and other items at another shop. Not going to big Sainsburys by trike or bus, or to big Tesco by bus. Not going to collect library books. I have tried own brand items from Aldi and have found them acceptable. I plan menus for the week. My copy of MAFF Manual of Nutrition has been a useful read. Have you noticed any changes in availability of food or other goods in the shops? Whole milk and no semi skimmed milk in local supermarket Tuesday 17thMarch. But fully stocked since then. I usually go to big Sainsburys but just hopped into the small local branch to replace items which had run out by Monday 16th. Had to buy own brand items. That’s fine. Notice in Beverley Tesco, 12th March, limiting customers to 5 bottles of Domestos. Who needs 5? There has been less change than I expected – given what a son had told me about London and from pictures on television. If I had wanted vegetable oil there was only one type. There was only own brand mayonnaise ( which turned out to be satisfactory ). Such details are trivial. One just has to be flexible with thoughts for menus. 4. What do you think of the government’s response to the pandemic? It is an impossible situation as it is a new disease. I am glad the experts come on each afternoon at the daily briefing – so it is not just politics. At first I wished there was a fixed time. Then the time did become standard. I found many questions from journalists clever, or repetitive, rather than useful. I am pleased when eminent epidemiologists explain – rather than journalists. There are some good programmes with experts. It was a galloping situation. One has to be patient. As long as the government listens to its experts and revises details as special cases arise we should emerge at the other end. One has to be stoical – it is not smallpox or bubonic plague, or a war. The government and all of us have to learn. It outlines how there is a myth about the Blitz spirit. When I saw the television pictures of bare supermarkets I was reminded of my eldest aunt telling me about food queues during the Great War. Rationing was brought in, and again in 1940. Many people are selfish, and have a herd mentality. I like the radio programmes changing from niche food ingredients, found in London, to war time – thrift – what can be made with X&Y out of the store cupboard. I would like a Parliamentary renewal of measures after 6 months, rather than everything being open ended. 5. Where do you get your news from about Coronavirus? Only from BBC 1 for daily update, and Radio 4. I read the Times when possible. 6. Any jokes or humour? I was an historical geographer – I tell anecdotes about the Black Death – which was in a different league of mortality. Trump, telling everyone that he is an expert. I burst out laughing. When the ministers were falling ill one after another I expected the afternoon daily update to be led by Larry the Cat. The Times then portrayed exactly this as the cartoon. The Now Show Radio 4, 11th April, in response to a tiger at Bronx Zoo had tested positive, a spoof of The Tiger Who Came to Tea – well it cannot be daddy, he has gone out for his exercise, it can’t be the grocer as I tried to book a delivery for 6 hours yesterday and I ended up as 1,700 on the list. + Diary of best TV and Radio Programmes: ( see below ) Humour is important"

How far did time change, or stay the same during pandemic?My experience of time passing was much the same as usual. But I am retired andlive alone.b. As lockdown eases in August 2020 â€“ look back on experiences of time and Covidso far.What does it mean to get back to normal, if it is? What might the future hold?Life is not back to normal. But it has developed a pattern and a new normal hasemerged.c. The rhythm or routine of the dayWith being ill, probably with Covid, in the week before lock-down, I found I completelylost my appetite. I therefore set a very formal pattern to each day. I set the time to getup, the time to eat breakfast, the routine of listing the radio and televisionprogrammes for the day ( as I now have no daily newspaper or Radio Times ), thetime     to drink coffee and check e-mails, the time for lunch, the time for dinner, and thetime to read in bed. My appetite has now returned but I have continued this dailyroutine, which is similar to, but more formal, than my days before lock-down.It was the weekly, monthly and seasonal routine which changed. Event after eventwas cancelled. I was surprised at the beginning of lock-down to realise that I couldnot go to York for summer clothes or purchase new underwear, tights or shoes. Ifound myself comparing lock-down life to what I had been told about the war â€“ whichonce the day time air raids had ceased life could still be dangerous but had interludesof tennis, concerts, church and dancing. I discovered that finding items at the back ofa kitchen cupboard pleased me as if there was wartime rationing.There was no Easter, no Ascension Day, no going for a day at the seaside, nobeginning of the Proms concerts.I stopped purchasing a Times on Saturdays as the village was more busy onSaturdays.I devised a weekly menu with particular items such as muesli, or fish on particulardays so I would have an extra reminder as to the day of the week.d. In what ways has time in daily life been disrupted?In the first days of lockdown did daily rhythms, routines and habits change?My habit of using my bus pass to go to a local town to purchase one item, or lookround, ended at once. The radio in the dining room failed, my blender failed, I ran outof string and sellotape and I could not go into town to replace them.I had also developed the habit of purchasing some items at one supermarket, otheritems at another, and bread at a third shop . This ceased and I had to get everythingin the supermarket in the village. I found myself joyful at finding seasonal fruit,radishes, and all sorts of previously normal items.I do not shop on-lineWith being ill the actual lock-down was a background event. At that date I was reallymore interested in monitoring symptoms. Now, months later, science programmes onthe radio have listed all of these.I do not wear a watch so I have Radio 4 on and know the time in blocks, dependingon which programme I can hear. The radio time slots have been important inmeasuring each day and indicating when to put the kettle on. This is not new. It wasSxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B6659.pdfperhaps in the 1970s that Radio 4 decided to change the Today programme fromspecific time slots to a free flow of topics. On the first day of the new format manypeople arrived late and cross.I was also constrained by the rotas and rhythms of my sons and their work, and whenthey might phone.e. How did this feel?I felt it was a challenge to overcome.At the beginning of lockdown I was also involved on-line with moth-balling the parishand devising systems to keep in touch with the congregation, reading on-linepaperwork from a local school, and mothballing a local society, without anyexperiences  from past events. There was a week when I felt as if I was working a 9to     5 on-line.How did changes come about? Were changes connected to government advice ornot?I tried to follow government advice. With having been ill, even mildly, I was aware ofhow easy it was to catch.I have been cautious about the relaxation. The monthly pattern of attending societiesremains on-hold while risk assessments are finalized.My life was disrupted in very strange ways. At the beginning of lock-down, when Iwas still fatigued, I was eating lunch when I heard the crash of broken glass upstairs.I went upstairs and found a brick shaped hole in a bedroom window but no missile. Itwas during the period when there was almost a curfew day and night so it was notonly unexpected, I was puzzled. There was no missile on the drive. So I went backupstairs and followed the glass fragments across the landing and into the bedroomopposite. There I surprised a pheasant which was sitting on a lamp. It took to wing,knocked the lamp to the floor, flew across the landing and burst out of anotherwindow in the first bedroom. I found it dead on the drive and left it for the foxes. As Istill had symptoms I did not try to get a glazier and ended up boarding up myself,then sweeping up and washing all the furnishings. Because of the lock-down I had towait for a son to come home, once this was allowed, to do repairs. I still have notbeen able to travel to a shop to purchase another lamp.I had lost my sense of smell so did not realise I had a gas leak until I had a massivegas bill. Fortunately I had not lit the fire when the hot weather broke and thetemperature fell. So I had a saga of gas fitters tracing pipes, emptying cupboards,moving furniture, lifting floor boards, installing new pipes, and then a pause of severalweeks before the AGA was serviced. So my life took on an unusual pattern with noinstant hot water or usual means of cooking. I ate a lot of salads.f. In what ways have aspects of life sped up or slowed down?To a great extent the pace of life remained the same. But the details changed asevent after event was cancelled.I expected to have spare time. But this did not happen.I was not furloughed.I had no responsibilities for looking after others.g. Experiences of new hobbies, studying on-line etc.I saw the pandemic coming and stocked up on materials for new hobbies so I couldstay in as much as possible. I did not foresee the lock-down.SxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B6659.pdfI have not yet mastered tablet braiding. I need some wet weather to keep meindoors.I have embarked on a wholecloth double summer quilt and am teaching myself howto do it. I have been reading about examples at Beamish Museum.I have done excellent courses on-line in the past. But during lock-down I did notstudy on-line because I felt I was already spending more than enough time on-line.I had a pile of library books, but these were soon read. I missed not having the locallibrary. This has now returned on a click and collect basis. I scoured the bookcasesand tried Proust for the third time, and failed to get beyond chapter one. But I did findother unread books and finished those. Also I downloaded Sweetâ€™s Anglo SaxonPrimer, and made some progress with that.h. Have I spent more time than usual in the local environment?Yes. During the lock-down there was no possibility of catching a bus to any localtown. Even since lock-down was eased I have only been beyond the village once. Iwent by bus into town to purchase a book. It was an experiment to see if it waspossible. I was the only person upstairs on the bus, I had checked in advance thatthe  shop had the book in stock and I came straight back on a bus. But from the bus Idid see long queues outside shops such as Primark and a shopping centre.I have spent most of my days in the house or garden. I now go to the village morethan once weekly.I started going out daily by bike for exercise but I found that although there was notraffic I was coinciding with funeral processions. I was also very fatigued for someweeks. So I started to walk up and down stairs and eventually equalled Everest. I gotused to this regime of going up and down stairs during ad-breaks, when the kettlewas boiling, or when tea was brewing, so I then embarked on a virtual walk up anddown stairs to equal the South West Coastal Path. I started at virtual Minehead andhave now nearly equalled virtual Lynmouth. It is an ongoing challenge. I am awareevery day of how many times I have gone up and down by lunchtime, and by dinnertime, and I tally the total for every day.I have noticed the seasons. The excellent weather earlier in the year was a greatbenefit. I did an embroidery of a still life of flowers, loosely based on a painting byRachel Ruysch in the National Gallery. I began by sketching and then embroidering aday lily and a columbine, then paeonies came out, then dog roses and honeysuckle,and eventually montbretia. The embroidery therefore records how many months ittook me to complete the entire picture.Being in the garden, rather than rushing round the village, or to local towns, I waspleased to encounter hedgehogs and a young fox and to see bats, barn owls, akestrel, a larger raptor and a grey heron. But I never saw the comet. It was toocloudy.i. Are rhythms changing again?The big change in my days was the end of the Daily Covid Update at 5pm. I found Irather missed it.The rhythms of my days have not really changed with the relaxation of lock-down. Icannot see any great changes in the near future. It will depend on a vaccinationbeing introduced.But it is positive to see small shops in the village reopening.I did feel that during the lock-down everyone was in it together. But since there hasbeen some relaxation those with cars can get out and about. But I am still limited bybike range and caution about using public transport.I feel pleased to have survived so far. There is nothing that I can do to change things.I can just make the most of each day, and find different things to enjoy.SxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B6659.pdfMany of the things I might have done in the past, such as visiting the beach, areprobably now possible. But they would not, as yet, be so enjoyable.j. How do you make distinctions between different times of the day?I tend to spend different part of the day in different rooms, or in the garden and thenindoors.k. Do I describe parts of the day in new ways?No. This may be the effect of living alone.l. What factors influence the organisation of time?Firstly meal times, then listing radio and television programmes each day andselecting any worth priority, then the times when anyone has e-mailed to plan a timeto phone.m. What changes do you expect in future?I think in my life it will be personal choice within wider permitted relaxation, or futuretightening of regulations.There is so much unknown. I keep in mind that full lock-down might occur again.unknown. I keep in mind that full lock-down might occur again.I try to be optimistic, and make plans. But I try to remain realistic â€“ that all plans maybe abandoned.I have scrap booked all my cancelled tickets for this year. But I have optimisticallypurchased a scrapbook for next year.In general I think activities will have to be planned carefully. There will not be spur ofthe moment decisions to go to places or to meet people. It will take more effort tomaintain variety and enjoyment in life.n. Media and technologyI e-mail and telephone family and friends. I do not have Zoom, Skype or other visualoptions.I have found I have been in contact with people with whom I usually exchangeChristmas cards.I have not required any medical appointments.The dentist and optician have cancelled by e-mail. I await new appointments.I do not shop on-line.With living in a village I have not needed much new technology on-line. But e-mailhas been necessary. The lock-down would have been quite different 50 years ago.I check my diary every morning and have a daily list of tasks which I take with me tothe village, so I will not forget anything.Is life on hold in any way?Fortunately no.I have found queues for shops very polite and silent."

I work as a member of the professional support services within a university; providing training, guidance, and technical support for academic staff in using online learning & teaching tools. As can be imagined, with teaching moving wholely online, the workload in this area has increased dramatically. A great deal of effort has gone into ensuring the standard of support we provide is maintained; running regular online training sessions, producing new guidance, and dealing with queries as quickly as possible.	Initially there was not much change to the day, beyond not needing to drive to work, which was a plus. I quickly fell into a routine of starting work earlier, around 7am and finishing earlier, around 4pm, leaving plenty of time for a leisurely evening. I enjoy cycling, so once work is over I’m usually straight out on the bike for an hour or two. My teenage son lives with his mother & throughout the lockdown I’ve incor- incorporated a visit to see them on my evening rids. This has been a change; I’ve seen more of them since the start of lockdown than before. I guess this has been because I’ve felt it had been important to maintain some sort of contact & consistency, for my son especially, as his school & social lives have been disrupted. It is fortunate that, although we no longer all live together; we get along well enough.Homelife	I have been quite strict about keeping ‘work’ within work hours. Unless there is a specific emergency, the computers get switched off at 4pm & don’t go back on until the following day. I can see some colleagues have struggled with establishing a routine, judging by the emails that arrive at odd times of the night.	Mealtimes have broadly stayed the same although the temptation to get stuck into second breakfasts elevenses, mid-afternoon snacks, & etc is hard to resist and has resulted in me pedalling a good many extra miles to burn it all back off again!Media and technologyComputer technology defines my working life, but out-side of that I don’t make a great deal of use of it. I have always viewed it as a tool to pick up and use for a specific purpose then then put back down again. My home wifi is provided by mobile phone hotspot, my computers mostly consist of a Raspberry Pi and an android tablet. I have these set up to be able to access my work networks and run video conferencing. They fulfil all of my requirements for work. I have no television.	So, the extent to which I allow these types of media and technologies into my life hasn’t really changed beyond being involved in more online meetings & delivering training online rather than in a classroom.	What has changed is the amount of pen & paper writing that I do. I’ve kept a sporadic journal for years but have been quite diligent in making entries each day over the past few months. It is a good way, along with cycling, to get rid of any mental or emotional stress that builds up over the course of a day. It is a similar story with letterwriting, I’ve a circle of letterwriting friends who I keep in touch with and we’ve been sending letters to & fro much more frequently, some on a weekly basis. It would undoubtedly be quicker & cheaper just to send an instant message or text but that is not the point. There is real pleasure in the sound of a letter from a friend hitting the mat in the morning.	Conversely, for work, I’ve stopped using the diary I used to take into the office with me, and have gone over to just using my work email & Teams calendar. While I was in the office, surrounded by a wholly digital environment, I felt I needed to maintain a last bastion of analogue communication so kept all my appointments and notes in my diary. Working from home, this need has been removed.Waiting	I’ve not really experienced any sense of ‘life on hold’, rather that it has gone back to a more sustainable pace. There have been few delays for me, some items ordered online have taken a little longer to arrive but everything got here eventually. The only thing that has been cancelled was the holiday to Portugal that I was going to take in May but I’m sure that will happen in the fullness of time.Waiting (cont.)	Shopping hasn’t been a problem. My diet is quite simple and I have always been able to find the basics somewhere in town. Virtually all my shopping is done on a bike, with panniers to carry the food. The shops are only a five minute cycle from my house so this makes more sense than sitting in traffic in the car. I’ve only used the car a handful of times since March, it sits on the drive gathering dust and cobwebs. If I didn’t need it for providing parental taxi service I would get rid of it altogether and will probably do so once my son is old enough to drive himself.	I’ve been aware of large queues outside some shops and supermarkets but have no joined them, preferring instead to return at a less popular time; very early in the morning or later in the evening.	One are where waiting has occurred is while out walking & cycling. There is (or was) much more caution around passing people, to maintain some sort of social distancing. On shared walking/cycling tracks this translates into much stopping and starting, waiting for people to pass or waiting to see what they will do before deciding ones own course of action."

I feel that too many people have died from Coronavirus to simply not have a vaccine.  I think that some people are using any excuse to not get the vaccine, political reasons, side-effects etc, for me personally I think it is an insult to those who have died and the loved ones they have left behind. Iâ€™m not too worried about which vaccine I receive, the reports on the Oxford jab causing blood clots to have been proven to be very rare and as with all things like this, it is never risk free.  I have followed government guidelines throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so, I havenâ€™t seen some members of my family for well over 6 months and miss them terribly, I am looking forward to when I can travel so see them and spend time with them. There are several places that are being used as vaccine centres in this area, I am going to two separate ones for my jabs, the first (Yeovil) being more convenient to get to.  For the second I will be travelling to Taunton. I am not worried about having a vaccine passport, if I need one, I shall get one.

However, I have been shielding with my elderly mother and while she was able to be given her covid jab at home by a district nurse, I would have had to get a bus to my local Primary Care Centre to have it done. This would have been placing us both at risk â€“ I could have been infected while out of the house and then brought the virus home to her. As such, I postponed my dose of the vaccine and considered asking my GP if I too could have it administered it at home. While I was pondering this, I spoke to one of my neighbours â€“ at a safe distance -who mentioned the possibility of their being an allergic reaction to the inoculation. That made me hesitant. I stopped having the flu jab because I kept having an adverse response to it (my upper arm would become hot, swollen and very sore.) I also have an allergy to a common painkiller and once had to go to hospital when I was in agony with my back and had broken out in an itchy rash from head to foot â€“ I feared it was meningitis but the doctors couldnâ€™t pinpoint what the cause was and eventually concluded that it was probably an allergic reaction to â€˜something.â€™ (It was a week before I was back to normal.) I didnâ€™t much fancy the idea of potentially going into anaphylactic shock at home or a Primary Care Centre, so I decided to delay my vaccination until my mother was fully immunised and then I could hopefully get it at my GPâ€™s surgery. However, I didnâ€™t expect that the third lockdown and the rollout of the vaccine would be so effective so soon in tackling the pandemic. I began wondering whether or not it was still worth having the vaccine. It isnâ€™t even guaranteed to prevent catching the virus anyway. I donâ€™t personally know anyone where I live whoâ€™s been seriously ill from the coronavirus (or died from it.) There are, however, reports of people developing blood clots -sometimes fatally -after receiving a covid jab they perhaps didnâ€™t need. The Astra Zeneca vaccine seems to be the main culprit for the deaths, so Iâ€™d rather receive the Pfizer or another alternative, but who knows how any of the varieties will affect people in the long run? It is now the 26th of September, 2021. Normality is creeping back into our daily lives but some â€“ increasingly less, it seems -people are still wearing their masks in public and presumably following the other previously suggested safety guidelines. Iâ€™m conflicted and cautious. Are we really safer again? I will be socially distancing, using sanitizer on my hands, wearing my mask and being careful where I go and when for a bit longer yet. It doesnâ€™t feel like weâ€™ve won the war on the pandemic. It feels more like â€˜weâ€™ve done our best but we canâ€™t keep on letting the virus disrupt things so weâ€™re just going to try to get on with our lives and see what happens,â€™...or weâ€™re being left to expose ourselves to the virus, the potentially catastrophic results of which could be used by the Tories to justify mandatory â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™, a few months down the line. The vaccine programme Early on in the roll out of the vaccine, I was contacted by telephone to be booked in for a vaccination at my nearest Primary Care Unit. I was offered my jab before my elderly mother, which surprised me, but it was perhaps because I have to look after her. We both received several letters afterwards, keeping us informed about the pandemic and urging us to have our coronavirus shots. (I gather that the phone calls and correspondence were from the local civic centre.) It appears that, understandably, the vulnerable and the old were the first to be inoculated. Health workers got their jabs justifiably early too. Subsequent vaccinations were allocated to middle aged people and presumably will continue down the age groups to the youngest. Making vaccines mandatory I think itâ€™s unreasonable to force anyone to have a vaccination unless it is proven to be 100% safe and 100% effective. We already know there are immediate risks with the covid vaccines (potentially deadly ones) and who knows how they will affect people in years to come. If I were a conspiracy theorist, Iâ€™d anticipate that some of the vaccines will eventually cause infertility â€“ the virus gets rid of the old, the cure prevents the young...either way, the world population is kept down. As for â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ to determine where we are able to travel, it all strikes me as being a bit sinister â€“ however necessary it may be. A regular passport already reveals a personâ€™s movements from country to country but if it gets to the point where people have to have proof of being vaccinated to do something as simple as enter a pub â€“ just people going about their daily lives basically â€“ then I think things are becoming excessive. Records of where people have used their â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ could be (mis)used simply to track people and document their activities. Weâ€™d be moving away from diligence to prevent disease to surveillance that curtails privacy. Does the problem really warrant this solution? (If implemented, I suppose it could help to stop the spread of illegal immigrants, as well as the spread of the virus.)"

For both doses I was invited by text from my GP surgery to book an appointment online at Northallerton Forum, an arts and community venue about a 20 minute drive from home and therefore very convenient. My partner (C) was invited to book his vaccines at the same time so we were able to book appointments close to each other and travel by car together. We were both moved up the priority list for vaccinations as we both have Coeliac Disease, an autoÂ­immune condition. On both occasions the centre was well-organised, with volunteers in hi-vis jackets directing traffic in the car park and people to the entrance to the centre.  There were directional arrows outside and inside the centre showing us where to go, posters explaining what was expected in terms of social distancing and wearing of face coverings (compulsory for all people in the building unless medically exempt) and a volunteer directing us to clean our hands with hand gel and then walk down the corridor to a reception table. Between the entrance and reception, volunteers stood outside the public toilets to monitor people going in and out to reduce capacity/allow for social distancing to be maintained. At the reception table 2 volunteers had slips of paper, showing names and NHS numbers, laid out in order of timed appointments and handed each of us our slip and then directed us to go into a room next to reception where more volunteers directed us to sit and wait on plastic chairs (these spaced out in rows at regular intervals of around 1.5m and sprayed and wiped clean by volunteers each time a chair was vacated).  There were 4 tables, one in each corner of the room, each staffed by 2 people -one giving the injections and the other entering details of the vaccination (date of injection/batch number of vaccination) onto a computer database and onto a card which was given to the person receiving the vaccine to keep. On both visits the workflow was steady but not at full capacity, with only about a third of the waiting chairs in use at a time.  My partner and I went prepared, wearing short sleeve t-shirts and taking off outer layers whilst in the comfortably heated waiting area in readiness for the vaccine; the number of people who didn't think to take off their outer layers until they were called up for their vaccine and then performed a hurried pantomime of disrobing was perplexing! When I was called up for my vaccine I went to sit by the table indicated and the nurse delivering the vaccine took the slip of paper giving my details and asked me if I had any allergies and if I was taking any medication. F4813 Spring 2021 -The Covid-19 Vaccine Page 1 of 4 The batch number of the vaccine having been noted by the data manager, the nurse then prepared the syringe and asked into which arm I would like to receive the vaccination. The painless vaccination took about 10 seconds and the nurse then gave me a card with handwritten details of the vaccine identification code and the date and when the first vaccine was given I was also given an information leaflet about the vaccine, including possible side effects.  The nurse told me it was possible I might have a painful arm for a few days and feel slightly unwell (e.g. headache). I was told I should then go and wait for 20 minutes in the post-vaccination waiting area in case of any immediate adverse reaction to the vaccine. I kept my sleeve pulled up onto my shoulder as I always end up with a bead of blood at an injection site and no wipes/plasters were on offer -this was most disappointing as an adult colleague who'd received a vaccination elsewhere told me she received a plaster, a sticker and a lolly! I followed direction from volunteers to move into the next waiting area, a large hall with plastic chairs in rows, again spaced at about 1.5 metres apart and more ominously in the corner of the room a hospital bed and curtained screen on wheels for use should anyone be stricken down.  I stuck on my own plaster to keep the blood off my t-shirt (motto: be prepared) and waited with C until our 20 minutes elapsed and then C drove us home. On both occasions we received the Oxford vaccine. After the first vaccine I experienced a tender arm for around 3 days (tender enough to avoid lying on in bed) which started a few hours after the vaccine and around 24 hours after the vaccine I developed a persistent thudding headache for around 10 hours although was well enough to be in work. After the second vaccine I felt fine for around 10 hours and then started to feel generally unwell (tired, nauseous, hot) and went to bed early (about 8.30pm); the following morning I felt fine. With the second vaccine I had very little tenderness in my arm. As I write it is 5 days since the implementation of step 4 of the 'roadmap' on July 19th 2021, with national restrictions having more or less been lifted. I continue, however, like many others to be cautious and continue to largely avoid potentially crowded indoor spaces such as the public pool, supermarkets, cinemas and cafes. I am still wearing a face covering when I do go into indoor public spaces (e.g. petrol station shop), still hand sanitising when out and about and still social distancing.  I have recently been into a friend's house and my mum's house and shared a car with a friend without wearing a face covering but maintained some distance and opened windows for ventilation. In each case I was aware that the other person had also been doubly vaccinated. I think the lifting of restrictions on 19th July is premature and the rising numbers of cases, hospital admissions and deaths since the lifting shows that it is too early. The government has passed the buck and with the removal of legal restrictions is relying on individuals and corporations demonstrating caution to stem the spread. It's like removing the legal national speed limit on the motorway and expecting everyone to stick to a max of 70mph. Recent news footage of football fans without tickets trying to break into Wembley for the World Cup Final, gathering in huge congested crowds around the stadium, breaking into fights and spouting racist abuse shows that ours is F4813 Spring 2021 -The Covid-19 Vaccine Page 2 of 4 not a nation which can be relied upon for spontaneous displays of commonsense, self-control and altruism. My own caution is however reflected by the local authority for which I work, to a large extent in recognition of cases of Covid in North Yorkshire having risen steadily again in recent months. As County Council staff we are still following a position of working from home where possible, wearing face coverings in council buildings and maintaining limited capacity in work spaces such as offices and routines such as hand sanitising and cleaning of workspaces and shared PCs. Thus although the public may now enter one of our libraries freely without a face covering (albeit even during full restrictions we could not legally prevent entry to someone choosing not to wear one) for the time being they will be greeted by staff and volunteers still wearing coverings. I am on annual leave this week and will be interested to find out on my return on Monday whether there has been any conflict between staff and customers or between customers with differing views on lifting of restrictions. With regard to safety of the vaccine, I did have some mild concerns around receiving the Oxford vaccine as test results suggested it was slightly less effective than the Pfizer vaccine (which I would have preferred given a choice) and as there appeared to be a risk (albeit infinitesimally small) of serious blood clot which could result in death. I have to admit to having been hypersensitive to any twinges in my legs for around a month after each vaccine, but I am a self-diagnosed (aware of the irony here!) hypochondriac. There has been nothing in the medical data I have read to persuade me, however, that having the vaccine was not the right thing to do and I was grateful for the prompt rollout of the vaccine in the UK and for my own prioritisation on the list. I have got my information about the vaccine from printed material handed to me by NHS staff delivering the vaccine, from television news (mainly Channel 4), from printed news (mainly 'The Week' magazine) and from internet searching using recognised sites such as nhs.uk. I am aware of a vast amount of misinformation circulating on social media, but as I don't use social media have not seen any of this firsthand. Last night on Channel 4 news a man was interviewed in a hospital recovery ward having spent 10 days in intensive care due to Covid. He was in his fifties and had opted not to get the vaccine due to fear of side effects he said had been induced by reading stories on social media. He was now telling anyone who would listen that, having been close to death, Covid was far worse than any potential side effects of the vaccine.  In my professional role as a librarian I am currently working on developing a training module for staff, volunteers and potentially the public on identifying and accessing reliable health information, which is very pertinent at this time. Personally I think it's downright bonkers at this point in a global pandemic (the clues being in the 'global' and the 'pan') to be allowing anyone to travel abroad for pretty much any reason and in particular for a foreign holiday, an activity which a large proportion of the British public seems to identify as an entitlement, without which life cannot possibly be worth living. F4813 Spring 2021 -The Covid-19 Vaccine Page 3 of 4 The UK's red, amber and green system of access to countries has been chaotic and the decision to allow numerous flights in from India when it was know that the Indian (now known as Delta) variant was of concern inexplicable; likewise the apparent lack of concern over exporting Covid to countries with lower levels of vaccine delivery or take-up than the UK -our double jabbed travellers may be at lower risk of becoming seriously ill if they contract Covid but could be well be exporting it and passing it on to others in the countries they are visiting. The risk of new and perhaps more spreadable/resistant variants developing seems one which many developed countries are willing to take in the interests of appeasing the corporate world and their whining inhabitants who mistake a week in the Algarve for 'freedom'. I'm not convinced that vaccine passports make anywhere any safer; as I've said above a double jabbed individual can still get Covid and transmit it to someone else. Other issues would be the inevitable development of fake vaccine passports and the potential for conflict between those vaccinated and those not (for 'valid' reasons such as health issues, due to vaccine hesitancy or out-and-out anti-vaccine beliefs), putting staff in the firing line. I think those who are cautious will just avoid close contact in crowded spaces for a long period ahead. From a personal point of view I'm also not sure what form my passport might take as I'm in the small minority of people who does not have a Smart phone and doesn't want one, although my carefree app free days may eventually have to come to an end by necessity. The question as to whether or not any vaccinations should or shouldn't be mandatory is a complicated one to answer, with legal, social and ethical implications.  On balance I don't think any vaccinations should be mandatory but people should be encouraged to have vaccinations where beneficial by being given the right information in the right way for them and a chance to have their concerns addressed.  Some individuals may have valid reasons for not having a vaccine (e.g. health-related) and in this case could end up excluded from particular areas/activities unfairly. On the other hand, where countries such as France and Greece have recently announced they are making Covid vaccinations mandatory for particular workers (e.g. health and social care) or for access to particular activities (e.g. sports venues, cinemas) there has been a large surge in people now booking to get the vaccine who were reticent before and this push factor will have benefits for the wider population, with the more people vaccinated the better for all. A very tricky one............ F4813 Spring 2021 -The Covid-19 Vaccine Page 4 of 4"

I do not know anyone who has had the virus or been poorly but I am living in Dorset which is the third lowest area of cases at present. I have not left my house or garden since 17th March. I have a weak immune system because I have M.S. & was advised to self isolate a week before lockdown began. I used to go out to volunteer two mornings a week in a charity shop, to the library & to local cafes for a lunch once a week. My shopping habits have changed but not radically. I always have my groceries delivered once a fortnight so that system remains in place. I was unable to get a delivery slot at all when lockdown began but that was a one off. I filled in with a small delivery from a different supermarket & no one starved! After that small hiccup I booked a fortnightly recurring delivery slot so should survive as it is booked for me right through until January 2021. My husband has been out every afternoon & he has been happy to queue up for essentials. He has a tendency to veer towards the chocolate aisle & went positively wild after Easter when Easter Eggs were dramatically reduced! I have no complaints! It has been hard to find eggs (chicken not chocolate). Why? Chickens are still laying & people cannot stockpile fresh eggs surely? Vitamin D tablets have disappeared entirely so I have sat in the sunshine for 30 minutes daily to compensate! I know people have been very enthusiastic about the benefits of Vitamin D but I think it is rather like whistling in the dark if you do get infected. I feel totally sympathetic with our government & leaders. Well other than those silly ones who broke their own rules & advice of course. A hugely difficult job for them, I am sure that they are doing their best & trying to do the right thing. I cannot believe what a massive change it has made to everyone world wide. It really made me realise how terribly most people depend upon what were once considered luxuries. So many of my friends have had to miss out on holidays & short breaks abroad, all involving air travel. All completely unnecessary. People thought nothing of going on a shopping trip to New York for example. All the threats to our planet, even cruise ships are now in peril. We have three cruise liners anchored here in the bay. I really wish the world leaders had the time, the will & the knowledge to turn this planet’s self destruction around with a combination of ‘greener’ living for all & a return to life before the pandemic. They say people are going to be encouraged to travel to work by bike or on foot. As soon as the nice weather stops the vast majority will be back in their cars before the first puddle forms. I have been happier during lockdown than at any previous time since I can recall. My husband is a great lover of pubs. He usually spends three afternoons a week drinking & also has a couple or three nights away on a monthly basis from March to October. So this enforced staying in suits me just fine. I know where he is & what he is up to every day plus I am not left home alone at all other than during his daily exercise. Just the weekend before lockdown began he booked two nights in an hotel in Bath. He got so drunk the first night that he a really bad fall & spent the night in hospital. Even that serious escapade failed to curb his enthusiasm & he is eagerly awaiting the reopening of the pubs plus the return to normal services on public transport, hotels etc. He has never had so much money! I have never felt so relaxed! My life in lockdown has been filled with my usual hobbies of reading, crossword & jigsaw puzzles. I really haven’t missed the shifts at the charity shop much. I will return if it reopens. Before lockdown I used to go out even if I didn’t want to because I thought I should. Now I don’t have to make the effort. I don’t get any exercise either way as I need to go out on my mobility scooter. I can’t walk more than the length of my small garden. As my husband has been home so much more my tv viewing has reduced. To conclude I would like to say how much the internet has influenced people’s behaviour during lockdown & mostly all in a positive way. I still find this reliance on technology too much like science fiction to feel totally comfortable about it; especially using a tracking app. However, how much would have been raised by appeals & efforts like that of Captain Tom if we all had to write a cheque or buy a postal order to send to him by the Royal Mail?"

In January (21st) I was about to enter my local Post Office Stores and fixing my face-mask when my phone pinged and it turned out to be a text from my local surgery inviting me to go for my first â€˜jabâ€™ and giving me a choice of â€˜slotsâ€™ in two daysâ€™ time. I replied and chose Saturday 23rd which gave me time to ensure that my car, which had not been used for ages, would still start. I made the appointment for 16:40-16:50 as ten-minute slots were suggested. I had meant to test the carâ€™s starting motor on the Friday but various things happened to prevent this and so it was not until Saturday morning that I tried the car and the battery was, as they say, â€˜dead as a nitâ€™. Panic stations! I quickly put it on charge in the drive and covered the battery + charger with a waxed jacket to protect it from the sleet which was intermittently falling. Thank heavens I opted for an afternoon appointment. The venue, Clair Hall, Haywards Heath, was not far, a fifteen-minute drive in fact and luckily there was enough charge by three oâ€™clock to get the engine ticking over. I left home early as, once the car had started I did not want to tempt fate by stopping it and starting again. The journey was uneventful and I arrived terribly early to be greeted by a jolly volunteer in a hi-vis gilet at the entrance to the hall from the road. I apologised for being early and he ran through the drill â€˜park-up and walk back to the entrance [here he indicated said entrance] and donâ€™t worry about being earlyâ€™. This I did â€“ there were plenty of parking spaces free. When I came back to the entrance to the hall another bevy of volunteers greeted me and indicated that I should go to one of several people sitting at a sort of reception table. There I gave my name, date of birth and offered NHS number but they already had this on a form. I again apologised for being early but they said I could be seen straight away and I was then handed over to two more people who were almost fighting over which one should vaccinate me. This caused some amusement when I offered to raffle myself off for the privilege. I was taken to a cubicle formed of screens and told to sit and then asked some questions about general health, allergies, medication whether or not I had been tested for COVID-19 [answer no] and whether I had suffered from any of the symptoms of it [again answer no]. then I was asked whether I was left or right handed and I said right and explained that it had taken me several choices of tee-shirt to find one which was short sleeved and therefore best for being vaccinated and the nurse (?) said she was glad I was so thoughtful and that some people were dressed for the arctic and took ages to uncover enough skin to vaccinate. The actual â€˜jabâ€™ was practically painless though I was warned that the arm may ache a bit for a day or two, as indeed it did, but not too badly. The reason that the vaccination is administered at the top of the arm, in fact into the deltoid (?) muscle is so that it gets to the relevant parts of the body more quickly than if it was diluted by blood which would be the case if it had been injected into a vein / artery not sure which is usual. Then I had to sit in a designated sitting area for 15 minutes until it was clear that I was not going to suffer an immediate reaction. While sitting there I noticed volunteers coming to spray cleanser and wipe the seats of people who had just left. I had taken masses of things, knitting, books etc. to cope L4071 with a long wait but in the event I was actually outside again before my initial appointment time. The exit door was at the far end of the hall so that there was a logical conveyor route from entrance to exit. When I drove away the gentleman who had greeted me on arrival asked me how it went and I said that it was extremely efficient and that I wished that the vaccination people were running the country and he laughed. It does make me cross, and one of my sons is guilty of this, that our mendacious and corrupt government are claiming credit for the successful roll-out of the vaccination programme when it is the NHS, GPs and local governments who are responsible â€“ as they are every year for the usual roll-out of â€˜flu vaccinations though now the programme is upscaled of course. I asked which vaccine I received and was told that it was Pfizer and that my next instalment would be in April. Also was given a pamphlet explaining what, if any, side-effects might be experienced and what to do about them. My second injection should be administered in April. The whole experience was upbeat, friendly and everyone very jolly. I did not suffer any side effects and the sore arm was no worse than a dayâ€™s strenuous gardening or housework would produce. I had heard that people who were given the Oxford vaccine suffered a day or twoâ€™s discomfort. One of the people in the village who told me of her experience said that she and her husband had 24 hours of extreme discomfort and unpleasantness but they philosophically assumed that at least it was working. When my youngest son had his first (Oxford) jab recently he was feverish for the following day and I suggested he not go to the gym but he said he was going for a walk instead. Several of his friends who had the same vaccine, all in their early to mid-40s also suffered side effects from having this version of the vaccine. Mindful of the advice from the scientific community to â€˜act as though you have itâ€™ I continued to carefully follow guidelines â€“ i.e. social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home mostly â€“ except for walks, shopping and visiting my family â€˜bubbleâ€™ in the open air. Although it would have been preferable for more trials to have taken place before â€˜roll-outâ€™ this was obviously not feasible at present and having followed the development of the Oxford one and listened with respect to the wonderful June Raine I did not worry at all about receiving the vaccine, albeit that the one I actually received (Pfizer) was the one mostly given to those in my age group at the venue I went to. Most of the information I received about the vaccine was obtained via the press (Guardian and New York Times and news bulletins â€“ BBC) There is no reason for me to stop taking precautions and life has gone on pretty much the same although I have received family and friends in the garden from time to time and most of my walks take place with others who have also had the vaccine. I have now (on April 9th) received my second â€˜jabâ€™ and again good job I left home with time to spare as the Highways authority had closed the road I normally take to Haywards Heath and a 40 minute diversion was necessary so that instead of being exceptionally early for my appointment I was only just in time and very anxious for most of the journey. This time the experience was rather more perfunctory but still extremely positive. While sitting for the 15 minute after jab wait I was reading a book (about the Plantagenets) and the volunteer who showed me to my seat said how nice it was to see someone reading an â€˜actualâ€™ book and not just a Kindle. Did not like to tell her that I do L4071 download e-books for the library â€“ though am boycotting Amazon nowadays). I told her that I had worked as a librarian and archivist and she said that accounted for the â€˜real bookâ€™ then. When I asked if she was a nurse she told me that she was â€˜onlyâ€™ a volunteer and that in real-life she ran a training company. I thanked her for volunteering and we parted with smiles on both sides. Making vaccines mandatory Am not a fan of this â€“ it runs the risk of causing a two-tier system. Definitely donâ€™t think that whether or not a person has had the vaccine should affect whether or not they are able to enter pubs, restaurants, sports stadiums etc. Although I realise that many people are understandably desperate to visit relatives and friends overseas I think that conditions in specific countries are more important factors that whether or not a person has been vaccinated. As, before vaccines were extant, adherence to sensible guidelines, testing and symptoms are the best criteria. For myself I am increasingly coming to the conclusion, rather like Mr. Woodhouse in Jane Austenâ€™s Emma that it is best to stay in or at least close to oneâ€™s own home. Perhaps climate change regulations will make this necessary at some point and I am selfishly grateful that my days of travelling the world either for pleasure or for work are now over. Being vaccinated against smallpox, yellow fever and such like when travelling to countries where these diseases are endemic, and hopefully ebola if a vaccine is developed, should of course be mandatory otherwise common sense and scientific advice should rule the day."

Rtd vehicle mechanic Part One -Household Recycling. We recycle most hosehold waste , first bio degradable items in our composter , which we shared with a local rat , until we ended its acess. I'd like to thinkall card and plastics +glass  and tin cans are recycled, however I have seen in the kitchen refuse bin items that my wife cannot be bothered th recycle. I think I am much keener than she is . I made an enclosure ,with screen gates , made from recycled pallet timber , for the three wheelie bins we have . Green for plastics and tin , with a seperate compartment for card . Brown is for garden waste , grey for all else , ie normal waste , that is waste that companies will not or cannot recycle. An old washing basket sits by the backdoor outside in which we toss out cans etc , ready to be conveyed to the wheelie bin area at our leisure. I have a fondness for jars and biscuit tins, so some may linger in the garage until I find a use for them , or until I throw them out too. I am uncertain about some plastics , but I still throw them into recycling, empty toilet rolls have been refused by our collection service , so I add them to the composter. Why they refuse I do not know , perhaps it has already be recycled.K says there is a mark on the packaging, but I just use common sense to decide . Most items that have contained food are rinsed before disposal. I have taken old defunct epuipment apart to seperate plastics , ie hoovers, printers tools, any mechanical,electrical items. I love to recycle, after working at a Council workshop, I discovered a department that recycled in a big way for the councils benefit, scrap iron , concrete and soil. The workers there had a nice little sideline, taking home various sellable items. At the time I was attempting to put together a half finished house , that one of our daughters had bought , as a single mum , funds were limited. The mountain of scrap items that was delivered daily to the depot was a haven for me. Just before my shift finished I could be seen torch in hand searching through the waste. Often finding very servicable items, doors sinks ,cans of paint and timber. Garden lights still wrapped 'new', discarded. I was hailed by a driver , because he knew I cycled to work , and told that 10 or 15 racing bicycles were piled on the scrap iron , taken from a local cycling club , noe disbanded.I naturally claimed two for spares . Far too good I restored one and used it  when we lived in Mablethorpe , sold it to a local G.P , ( who fell off it and broke his arm). I still have the second machine and occasionally ride , but not so much these days. Our collections are alternate weeks , green /brown and next week grey, a large refuse truck with hydraulic rams lifts the wheelie and tips the contents into the large hopper , where it is compressed , where it is taken to I have no idea. Card in the smaller section is dropped into a seperate section.to be processed.. We rarely have a need to visit the local communal tip, but recently I had some brick waste , and we took that to the local tip . We very often deliver saleable items to charity shops , and sometimes to one of our daughters that sells at car boot sales. Ladies clothes and shoes are a big favourite. My clothes are too old and ragged after the downgrading from best -reasonable -working-bin process. Why recycle?. makes sense really , it may be inherent frugality, our mother always made sure we got the most from any item.I wore my sisters green raincoat, from her grammer school days , to school and out to play. Cardboard in a shoe was common to extend the life of the uppers, not a good solution in wet weather !. There is so much wealth in the country, I believe folk waste food and clothing, and mineral resources without thinking of the future. It is so obvious that we cannot continue taking from the earth, timber spring to mind. I have made many items frompallet timber gates, planters , racking shelving and fences, all from free timber that otherwise would have been scrap.As a free resource why on earth is it not more commonly used. I was extremely dismayed to see on tv the piles of UK waste deposited in India. Disposed of by unscrupulous companies. Rivers in Vietnam blocked by plastic waste. So much moneY spent on C19 , but what of the real issues. At campsites that we visit there are invariably no recycling facilities, in the event I have to shrug my shoulders and hope that one daythe area will wake up. I'd like to think that our waste travels along a conveyer at the recycle depot, where it is sorted into the correct areas. Steel to the smelters , the plastics to be processed and made into those park seats we see, that are indestructable, however in the real world more waste is produced than these companies can handle , and only a small percentage is re-cycled. Adjacent to the lovely vineyard where iI voluntarily work is a farm/small holding, the owner has waste of all kinds delivered there by small trucks, and then burnt, the small fee encourages the travelling community to be frequent visitors. The smell of burning plastics is quite worryingat times. The owner has been reported  several times, but no action has been taken. One view is that he prevents fly tipping . My view is two wrongs do not make a right. Never make purchases on the ability to recycle . C19 has made little change to my recycling, only that the local tip was closed , thus delaying my start on my building project."

The vaccine was administered at a mass drive-through organised by the local GP surgery at a small industrial estate two miles away, on a Sunday.  Unfortunately for the NHS staff and wonderful volunteers who stood outside with little shelter, it was very cold and snowing.  We, the recipients of the jab, drove round the site in two orderly queues and had the jab as we sat in our cars. We were advised to wait in the car park in our cars for ten minutes in case of any adverse reaction, after which we drove home. Although we stayed in our cars, I think it fair to say that the 2,000 recipients of that first Oxford/AstraZeneca jab were extremely grateful and relieved that day.  We had been told to stay at home for such a long time that this was almost like going out to a party. During the night of the first jab I felt first extremely cold in bed, and then very hot and feverish.  The next day it felt as if I had flu, but within two or three days I was back to normal. I have now had both jabs and my experience with the second (also Oxford /AstraZeneca) was just of feeling tired for a day or two afterwards.  As lockdown is gradually eased, I have followed the government guidelines religiously and have actually found it quite difficult to readjust to, say, going out and into non-essential shops.  At home we have continued to quarantine everything that comes into the house (e.g.purchases, post, deliveries) and to wash food delivered.  I am naturally concerned to hear that there have been adverse reactions to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in younger people. Younger members of the family have now received the Pfizer vaccine with no ill effects. The vaccine programme The programme here began with the very elderly and vulnerable at the local GP surgery. This surgery serves many villages and it was decided that the most efficient way to administer the vaccine was to order a large amount of vaccine and invite large numbers (2,000) of patients to participate.  The NHS is often criticised for its lack of joined-up thinking, but this drive-through showed the most impressive organisation and response to a situation that I have ever known. Iâ€™m not sure about the roll-out to key workers or carers here, though Iâ€™m led to believe that by now (end of June) a high percentage of all groups have had the jab. Like many people, I have relied largely on the BBC (or occasionally ITV or Channel 4) for trustworthy news about the pandemic and the vaccine programme.  I donâ€™t use social media for this purpose so have never read what is said there. Female; 67; married; Village in Suffolk; retired Associate Lecturer at the Open University M6790 Making vaccines mandatory It seems common sense that â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ should be used to enable travel to other countries, pubs and so on.  Itâ€™s equally important to make it mandatory for anyone seeking to come into the country for any purpose that they come with a vaccine passport.  That absolutely includes the hundreds of officials that UEFA has threatened to fly in for the EUROs final because not all European countries have the same attitudes to vaccination and lockdown. If even one person is allowed to come in with a positive test and without a passport, they have the ability to start a further wave of COVID here."

There was a slight confusion because telephone messages were also being sent from my surgery, and they directed you to different centres. I was directed to a large centre in Southampton which had previously just been used to vaccinate NHS staff; my wife, the next day, was directed to a nearby surgery which was dealing with patients from our own medical practice.  I had the Oxford vaccine, she the Pfizer one; mine was in my left arm, hers in the right; I have my second jab later this week; hers is the following week.  We both drove to our respective centres, and will do for the booster (we have not used public transport since the pandemic started.)  I don't know the status of the woman who delivered my first jab. Both of us found the staff very well trained and in good humour, confident and reassuring â€“ my appointment was first thing in the morning, and hers the last one in the evening. Neither of us had any side effects, and of course the actual injection was completely painless. I am used to donating blood, and the needle then has to be much larger. I am, of course, still following social distancing guidelines, although now feel happy about not crossing the road when I pass a neighbour! I am very pleased that the 'road map' does now seem to be working, although of course I have been disgusted by reports of selfish, senseless young people gathering together for parties and raves. Have they been so wrapped up in their own concerns that they've lost nobody to Covid, or maybe not even known someone who has had it? I have absolutely no concerns about the safety of the vaccines! All vaccines approved for use in this country have gone through all phases of trials, and the results are scrutinised by the regulating bodies before being approved and put into use; furthermore, as a matter of routine, they are checked for any possible side effects.  It is a great shame that the normal incidence of, eg blood clots in certain age groups, is not as widely publicised as those cases which have occurred following receipt of a Covid vaccine.  In any case, one event following a first event is not proof of causation!  The old Latin tag Post hoc ergo propter hoc is very, very wrong. It distresses me that certain individuals and groups disapprove of vaccines.  This is pure ignorance, and it betrays a trait of pure selfishness, in that the refuser is endangering slightly the lives of everybody else s/he meets. Male, retired teacher, aged 76 Fareham, Hants W-2322 The vaccine programme I have no information about exactly how the vaccine programme is being delivered, except that it is well organised and at every centre I have heard about, it is efficiently and sensitively delivered.  Certainly the vaccination centres are far better organised than the testing centres. We have been ahead of the expected schedule all along.  Although we made a mess of things through indecision and listening to vested interests in early 2020, on vaccines we have been a shining light to Europe and to the rest of the world. Making vaccines mandatory It is self-evident to me that the Covid vaccine should be compulsory, and that we need some sort of passport to prove this to others.  This should apply to everybody and to all areas, not just to foreign travel but to a local pub or restaurant. It is outrageous that some people expect to be employed in care homes and yet refuse to have the vaccine!  Without any doubt that must be a condition of service. Since vaccines are rigorously tested before approval and also constantly monitored during use, there is every reason to make all vaccines compulsory (unless there are sound medical reasons why that is not advisable in particular cases; but this would be a tiny minority). It is not a matter of personal choice, and has nothing to do with civil liberties: I have a civil liberty not to be infected with somebody else's disease, if a way is known to prevent this!"

The first dose we had at a vaccination centre at the Bolton Wanderers stadium. Everyone was lovely, very helpful and positive and it felt like a really big moment â€“ quite emotional. I was all very well done and we felt very safe being there. We (my husband and I who was also getting his first jab) travelled by car â€“ getting there by public transport would not have been easy. My second dose was at our local GP surgery. I had booked slots for our second doses when I booked those for the first but, living in Bolton where case rates were going up because of the Delta variant, it was the first place where there was a push to get the second dose after 8 weeks rather than 12. Our 8 weeks had just passed and I had not heard anything from the NHS and I was getting a bit anxious so I rang our local surgery (where my mother and friends had had their jabs) to see if they might be able to give us our second dose. As it happened, they were running an AZ clinic until 7pm that evening and they had spare jabs so they said just come along. I was actually at work but they said just go, you need it, so both I and my husband got our second jabs from there. They were absolutely brilliant, like a military operation and no issues with not being on their vaccination list for that day. When I went to cancel our original bookings for our second jabs, I was really glad that I had done this; in order to rearrange the bookings, we would have first had to cancel the old appointments and then make new ones, and as this was a bit fraught, I probably would have left it to the 12 weeks rather than risk not being able to book an earlier slot, having already lost our original slots. In both cases I think that our vaccines were administered by medical personnel. Both of us had sore arms after both doses, and my husband had headaches and muscle aches for about 36 hours after the first dose. I may have had some headache but I donâ€™t remember. Either way, we didnâ€™t have any side-effects that were a problem. We are still following all mandated government guidelines, although as I cannot work from home I have been in my workplace throughout the pandemic. We have also been out three times, which I think satisfies the spirit and requirement of minimising travel (current guideline for us). The timescales on restrictions make sense, but I really feel for everyone in those industries most badly effected by closures, especially with the delay in lifting restrictions (I am writing after it was decided to delay opening up from 21st June to, B7515 hopefully, 19th July). I am, however, increasingly unhappy with what is happening with schoolchildren. Recently our local news ran an item including a secondary school student who was having to self-isolate for the 6th time, after her bubble had burst yet again; a friend who is a teacher says that this is not uncommon. And of course, it is not a level playing field as infection rates are much higher up here in the Northwest, so our children must be having to miss much more school, against a general backdrop of education issues anyway. This is really not fair and, given that a recent BBC article reported that only 4% of those students currently isolating actually have the virus, it is not proportionate either. There is currently huge pressure for change when the schools return after the summer break and I fully support this; it cannot go on like this. I donâ€™t have any concerns about the safety of the vaccine. I understand why it has been delivered so much more quickly than other vaccines, and that it has gone through all the required medical checks. Given that this time last year the scientists were not even sure that a vaccine was possible, to me having not one but several vaccines is nothing short of a miracle and a real testament to the power of science. The vaccine programme I get quite irritated when it is said, sweepingly, that people â€˜wouldnâ€™tâ€™ have the vaccine. Locally, delivery initially seemed to be a mixture of vaccine centres and GPs. When the infection rates spiked in Bolton, however, the existence of a vaccine bus also became evident (apparently there was already one but at least one more was used) and more centres were opened up in the middle of communities. This made a lot of sense to me; we could not have got to our first vaccination centre without a car and even for our GP, if you had to go by public transport that would be two buses for a distance of just a mile or so, and our buses are not the most reliable. So, my view is that a lot of people â€˜hadnâ€™tâ€™ had the vaccine, and if you really want people to do something then you have to make it easy/possible for them; one of my brothers works freelance in hospitality and he was having trouble getting his second jab as he may not know what he is working tomorrow let alone weeks ahead and he certainly could not lose a day, or possibly even days, of work. A lot of people are in his position, on zero hours contracts, etc. So, you have to make it so they can just pop along when they are able. It was wonderful to see how many people got their vaccines when they could do this, and the view that young people would be hesitant has been completely blown out of the water by the fact that they have broken the NHS website every time a new age group has been invited to book appointments. I know that there are people who wonâ€™t get vaccinated; I work with someone who wonâ€™t. I think, to be blunt, that he is wrong. You might not know exactly what the vaccine might do to you years down the line but what Covid will do to you is abundantly clear, and, quite frankly, you donâ€™t want to get it. End of. I stay with mainstream media for information. I have no truck with the disinformation that is being spread via social media and certainly am not going to give it any credence by paying any attention to it. B7515 Making vaccines mandatory I can see that this may be a practical solution to a real problem, although I have concerns about the fairness of it, and how it will be implemented. There are, for example, people who cannot (as opposed to will not) have the vaccine. There are also people who have been involved in trials, for example of the Novavax vaccine, which is not yet approved. Proper arrangements need to be made for such people so that they are not excluded. At the moment, Malta looks like it is going to require visitors from the UK to be fully vaccinated, including children over 12. The UK currently has no plans to generally vaccinate children between 12 and 18 so how is this going to work? Also, how is it going to be done to minimise fraud? Malta apparently wants a letter from the NHS, an actual paper copy, confirming that you are double vaccinated. Good luck with getting that â€“ I think that the NHS has rather better things to do at present, and you can get an electronic statement of your vaccination status through the app, which seems to me to be a much better solution for most people. We shall see if such an approach is actually workable in a way that is meaningful, secure, and not discriminatory. My feeling is that if you work with vulnerable people then you should be required to have the vaccination to protect them, yes."

The times I remember when I have not were:• Early in the lock-down, driving to work and seeing the roads so empty. It's nice not having any traffic but remembering why there was no traffic upset me;• When a friend had to cancel her Pilates classes and therapy sessions. She runs her own business, so I felt very upset on her behalf;• Over the Easter weekend -we are part of a group of four couples {one sadly now widowed) whose children went to the same nursery and we have been 'getting together' three or four times a year for the last 25 years. We would have been doing something on one of the days over Easter and I felt very sad that were not doing it this year;• At the end of the second Great British Sewing Bee episode when there was a big group hug with the sewer who was leaving. I made me suddenly realise what we have lost, at least for the foreseeable future;• I sing in a choir and you can't really replace that. Just before lock-down I started learning the alto recorder. I have not played it since lock-down as this is for better times and I miss music too much. Just writing this upsets me. So I just don't think about it as there is nothing to be done a present.I think, overall, that the political decisions that have been made are OK, particularly at the beginning- although I am writing this before Boris's address to the nation this evening so may feel differently then. I can see that balancing everything is an incredibly difficult task and those in government are human like the rest of us. I fear for the economy, and the future job situation, and at one point did feel that everything was being sacrificed for the NHS. But, I could not see what else could be done at that moment in time. I do think, however, that there was a big mistake was with respect to care homes. Over Easter there was an item on the radio from a care home manager who said that they were told to take people discharged from hospital. Contractually they could not refuse, yet these people had not been tested so they could have been bringing the virus in with them. This does seem to be a bit of a blind spot, to say the least. I also think that testing should have been scaled up much sooner - I don't see how you can move forward without access to comprehensive testing.The Government is going to have to open up the economy, but I really don't know how they are going to deal with the situation with regard to public transport. My husband travelled by train to work, and I drive. We would both love to walk or cycle, but his work is 15 miles from home and my work is 19 miles from home, so this is not possible. There is talk of 'more services' to allow for socialdistancing, but Northern could not reliably deliver the service advertised before the pandemic so the idea of them increasing services is a joke. I dread the thought that everyone will just pile into their cars instead - my journey to work was already bad. A close friend is a teacher and she is within the '50%' of people who are supposed to live within 3 miles of where they work. However, a) there are several large hills between where she lives and she works, and b) as a teacher she carries a lot of stuff between home and school. So she is not going to be walking/cycling to work either. The government is going to have to get a whole lot more real about this aspect of getting the economy going again II stick to the BBC - TV and online.I have watched some of the daily briefings and think that they have generally been well-structured. I like that different people lead them, and various experts are present as well.I don't have challenges but I have noted the signer with the Scottish briefings. I think that this is very good and should have been done for the Westminster briefings.Both my husband and I have been working through the lock-down so far. He has been working from home but I have to go into work. Most people in my company have either been furloughed or are working from home so there is just a small group of us actually in work. We are all part of the same department anyway (which is why are in work) but we have formed a close working group as a result of it being just us.Because it has been just my husband and I at home, and we are both still in employment, there has not been too much strain at home, although perhaps we have been a bit more snappy with each other, especially early on when everything was so very worrying. I think that we have also just settled into the routine more as time has gone on and not look too far ahead - even I am learning not to worry about the things I can't change! My mother lives just round the corner, so when we deliver her paper we ring the bell for a quick chat. The more distant relatives are well, so far, so that has not been an immediate worry. We have been lucky.We have started to use Zoom for meetings with our friends, and our son and his girlfriend, and I have had to become reacquainted with Facebook (which I never really used) for the Scrub Hub. Work has also organised quizzes using Survey Monkey and Zoom. This afternoon my husband has set up an online Dungeons and Dragons session, as the group has not been able to meet since lock­ down. All of these things have been a bit of a challenge at first, but we are OK with it all now.So far we have been lucky with shopping- my husband does the shopping and was able to get pretty much all he needed even when people were panic-buying. As there is just the two of us and we are pretty flexible, ingredients could be swapped where needed. We have not really changed our eating habits (perhaps a bit more chocolate and cake!).We always have a list of things that need doing in the house or garden so this has actually been a good opportunity to get on with things- thank goodness for online deliveries! We have both been producing things for key workers (my husband has been 3D printing visor parts and I have been making scrubs bags) so we have not really had chance to be bored. I am missing Zumba and Pilates but am walking more regularly, and we are walking more locally-we did not realise quite how manynice walks there are nearby. My TV viewing has probably reduced as I now have quite a lot to do in the evenings!There have been no changes in my personal hygiene as my routine is the same as it was before lock­ down.I would not say that my sleep has been massively affected. I am at a time of life when one tends to wake up in the night anyway, so am used to being awake, sometime for quite long periods. If anything, it is possibly better, because I worry about it less - it is suddenly OK to have sleep issues, or at least talk about them, so I feel less at odds with other people and a bit more like I am normal."

Mass-Observer B3227 describes themself as male; age 53; unmarried; 'not in paid work (made redundant due to COVID-19)'.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body I would define ‘health’ as the proper functioning of the body in the absence of illness, and ‘wellbeing’ as the sense a person has – based on an ongoing awareness of their physical and mental health – of themselves in their body. Wellbeing has links with ‘wellness’, I think, a concept that turns their own health into an absorbing hobby for people who don’t havemuch wrong with them.  Wellness has become an industry, allowing the capitalists to sell us a lot of unnecessary products. I don’t know whether it’s because I’m a gay man, or whether all men would do the same, but when I think of ‘a healthy body’, I think of a man’s body.  (Women would therefore think of a female body.) On the basis that both words and phrases are acceptable, the first five that come to mind are: slim, muscular (but not excessively), good skin, straight posture, clear eyes.  These are all outward signs suggesting that the internal processes of the body are being treated with respect and working correctly.  A particular person who comes to mind, not because I previously admired him or find him attractive, is the personal trainer and fitness expert Joe Wicks, who recently did a 24 hour workout for Children in Need.  Probably that achievement, which I did admire, is why I thought of him. He is obviously someone who takes his health very seriously.  Some adherents of gay culture make a big thing of being ‘fitness obsessed.’  This usually equates to bulging muscles, and depending on how those muscles have been achieved, may be due to a far from healthy lifestyle.  Joe Wicks (who is not gay) is slimmer and wirier: to me, proof that an improved appearance should not be the only benefit sought from a concern with health and fitness. Identity Top of the heap – those most likely to interpret their  health and wellbeing positively – would have to be, as in so many other areas, straight, white, middle class (especially privately educated) men, our society’s perfect conflation of sexual orientation, ethnicity, social class and gender when it comes to satisfaction at their place in the world. I score in two of these: ethnicity and gender. Broadly speaking, an individual’s health is informed by chance (medical conditions they may be born with or develop), the personal choices they make regarding diet and exercise, and access to health care. Wellbeing may be said to derive from how and where the person sits within the cross-currents of society’s approval and disapproval – this has an impact on their self-esteem and again on access to health care. Even now, society finds something to object to in the behaviour and attitudes of some women, the working class, Black British and British Asian people, and those who identity as LGBTQ. In some ways, these groups have to negotiate their essential unacceptability before they can hope to obtain the same level of consideration loud-voiced white men who learnt their sense of entitlement at expensive schools expect (and get) automatically. The Establishment (largely made up of such men) is naturally keen to blur the sharp lines of such differences. Last year, the Government’s report into why disproportionate numbers of ethnic minority citizens were dying of Covid-19 was partially suppressed: an article in the Independent on 13th June quoted a leaked copy as follows: ‘The unequal impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and asthma.’ The working classes generally have absorbed a related lesson: that their health is of less interest to everyone (including themselves) than the health of the ‘important’ people who run their lives. On 26th March, early in the pandemic, my friend N. emailed to say: ‘Tried going to Tescos in reasonable area, social class wise but the queues were too long, with everyone standing two metres apart for goodness knows how long before being allowed into the shop.  I was too impatient to wait so I went to Aldi’s in New Ferry, a rough area.  The difference made me laugh.  No one here was queueing or looking remotely bothered about catching anything.  I just think New Ferry folk have been through too many tough times to be quite so precious about their health. After all, they probably all smoke and drink too much as it is, so not new to taking risks as far as their health goes.  I bet if I went to Heswall, a very well to do area, they’d all be wearing masks, that’s if they ventured out at all, which is unlikely.’ On another occasion, she referred to those ‘from snooty middle class backgrounds with their sense of entitlement to eternal life.’ Class has an impact, not only on a person’s feeling that they have the right to ask for medical help, but also on their ability to meet those providing it on an equal footing and to ask for clarification when confused. N., who used to be a nurse, has told me of bereaved relatives meekly thanking a junior doctor when she and theother nurses knew that if it hadn’t been for that doctor’s mistake, the patient would still be alive.  I know we have all been socialized into praising the NHS to the skies, and I am not knocking them, but we secretly all know – surely? – that the best medical outcomes go to those who can afford private health care.  Perhaps we praisethe NHS so fervently because we don’t wish to see this. The only area where straight, white, middle class, privately educated men might be said to suffer is with their mental health, but even this they have turned to their advantage, pushing to the front of the queue with news of their redemption: they have broken free from the stiff upper lip regime in which they were brought up and are now proselytizers for emotional honesty. The TV presenter Phillip Schofield, although he does not qualify in all categories, typifies this approach with his disingenuousness over not coming out until the age of 58, telling Steve Wright on Radio 2, ‘Men are just rubbish talking about these things’ (conflating honesty about sexuality, even to oneself, with the acceptance and discussion of difficult emotions more generally). Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have two early memories of learning about health and wellbeing.  As children, my brother and I were only allowed sweets at Christmas and on our birthdays.  Even then we could only have them in the evening, just before we cleaned our teeth to go to bed.  My mother strongly disapproved of other women who gave their children packets of sweets to occupy them while they did their supermarket shopping. Later she told me that her younger sister D , who did not share her views, thought her attitude cranky and absurd.  Sweets would have been on ration until my mother reached adolescence (she remembered going to the shops to buy them for the first time when rationing ended; this would have been in 1953 when she was 14), so perhaps she never acquired much of a taste for them.  The message transmitted to myself and my brother was that sweets were bad for your teeth.  This meant that it never occurred to me to go into a shop and secretly spend my pocket money on them. The second memory is to do with my mother’sinterest in health and wellbeing (although it was not called that then).  In the 1970s, a health food shop opened in Shrewsbury, an era when such places – at least in Shropshire towns – were still considered unusual, and before chains like Holland and Barrett arrived.  Itwas called ‘Crabapple’ and the assistants had long hair and grotty jumpers – it was the mid-seventies after all, so not that distant from the peak of hippiedom – and sometimes, my mother noticed, dirt under their fingernails; but it was the only shop she could get fresh yeast for bread-making.  From that she progressed to mung beans and the chocolate substitute carob and the meat substitute TVP or textured vegetable protein, an early soya product.  She also bought the magazine Here’s Health and made recipes from it (I seem to remember the actress Andrée Melly, George Melly’s sister, was a columnist).  Our palates were not always co-operative, and we objected to carob for its dusty taste, and insisted on adding jam or raisins to the natural yoghurt she produced with her newly acquired yoghurt maker.  (But since she made the jam herself, that was not so terrible.) From those anecdotes, you can see that my mother took responsibility for our health and wellbeing when my brother and I were young. I don’t remember any specific conversations on the subject: it was more a case of following the behaviour that was being modelled for us.  My parents didn’t go out to pubs and only drank commercially produced alcohol around Christmas.  My father had phases of making his own wine (damson, blackberry, parsnip and other even less appetizing vegetables).  However, intake reached a natural limit because only the red fruit varieties were actually pleasant to drink.  Neither of them smoked.  I still remember with a little embarrassment an assembly I took part in early in secondary school.  The topic was smoking, and included the final line (suggested by my father), ‘And remember, if God had intended us to smoke, he would have put chimneys on our heads.’  The boy who said it then had to eat the cigarette-shaped sweet he’d previously been pretending to smoke. (Can you imagine it now?  Sweets made to look like cigarettes?  But they were common enough then, and as far as I recall, unremarked upon.) I don’t recall any sessions about health at school, either primary or secondary. I was in the schools system from 1971 to 1985, and I have the feeling that in those years it would have been seen as faddy and presumptuous for educators to advise children on their health.  That was the parents’job, should they care to interest themselves.  My impression is that the seventies were quite laissez-faire when it came to preventative health measures – for all ages. We had sex education classes (known as ‘Learning to Live’) at grammar school, and Iimagine we would have been tentatively informed about sexually transmitted diseases, although I have no memory of it. As an adult, although I have occasionally bought magazines like Men’s Health or used the internet to research diet and fitness, I don’t feel that they have been major influences. When I took up running, I got a book out of the library. When I wanted to eat more healthily, I bought a book of recipes. I am too old and the wrong sex to have been harmed by the idealized images of female bodies in women’s glossy magazines, but I have certainly caught the harmful tailwind of its crossover to the male body via Instagram and so on. Although I take regular exercise, and often think I should do more, I have never been sporty. I was always amongst the last to be picked for team sports at school, so my friends were not the athletic types. I was more or less left behind by the peer pressure to be physically active.  I think it is worse for teenage boys and young men now due to a combination of a more sedentary lifestyle (e.g.: hours spent playing computer games) and the social media emphasis on looking fit and ‘worked out.’ The two modes are obviously incompatible.  Key moments I started shaving when I was at sixth form.  At my grammar school (a different institution), I seem to remember some talk about shaving in our final year.  One boy was keen to tellus he had got an electric shaver for either his birthday or Christmas.  I don’t remember being particularly impressed; more puzzled, I think.  I suppose at that age, boys are eager to adopt it as a marker of manhood.  After 35 years of the monotony of it, I wonder why anyone would be so keen to start.  There was a path to negotiate, of course, one subject to the critical attention of other boys. In the other class in my year, there was a boy who was absent for great stretches of time, and who was frequently bullied when he was in school.  He developed facial hair early on, and got given the nickname ‘Wookie’, after Chewbacca in Star Wars. The bullies homed in on the unmistakeable discrepancy between his undeveloped social skills and premature signs of manliness. I don’t recall my father taking much interest in my starting to shave.  We were driving along one day, and I must have been talking about it, because he said from the front of the car, ‘A cat could lick that off with a bit of butter.’  As an expression that sounds like an old country saying (and probably was, given his background), I quite like it, and I know he meant it as a pleasantry, but it made me feel unsupported and rather confused. I don’t remember my voice breaking. When my grandfather died, a lot of sheet music which had been stored beneath the seat of his old piano stool came into my brother’s possession (he was musical, and played the trombone and recorders). I do remember one day us trying to sing through something, I think from The Sound of Music. (This was far from typical behaviour, by the way.)  I could still get the high notes and my brother couldn’t, and I felt pleased with myself because my voice hadn’t broken yet. Subsequent to this, in the eighties and nineties, there was a vogue for individual choir boys releasing records – Aled Jones and Anthony Way, for example.  Naturally there was a certain amount of speculation about how long their careers could last, and I began to see the breaking of a boy’s voiceas a kind of menace waiting to jump out at them in the middle of a concert. At some level my parents were probably embarrassed by the bodily changes associated with my puberty.  We were not a very physical family.  My mother used to sometimes say – in a deliberately comical voice –‘Move your bo–dy’ when I was in the way of her doing something, and I would feel uncomfortable at her even saying the word. I was very self-conscious.  Aside from a changing voice, and facial (and body) hair, there is a third rite of passage implying that all is progressing internally – psychologically and sexually – as it should: the first girlfriend.  Since this never happened either with my older brother or myself, and was never spoken about by my parents, perhaps it tended to overshadow the other stages and make them similarly difficult to address. Growing older It’s my belief that children, as long as they don’t suffer from any condition that marks them out from other children, don’t much consider their bodies.  Adolescence brings self-scrutiny, and for me, extreme self-consciousness, so much so that I avoided examining my body in detail.  That sounds strange, but it was sometimes years before I noticed a particular detail about my physical appearance, for example that one of my ears stuck out more than the other, that should always have been obvious. Even now, I could not say which one it was without checking in the mirror.  My self-criticism was reserved for my internal rather than external features; the latter I hardly dared consider. This meant I lacked an obvious motivation for exercise: vanity and the urge to improve my appearance.  I was physically robust and so my health did not trouble me. Any exercise I took came by accident.  I was apprehensive about learning to drive, avoided it, and therefore had no choice but to cycle twelve miles a day, there and back, to my first job at a country park outside Shrewsbury.  The penny began to drop when I was unemployed, and again at university: I took up swimming and even went to the gym.  I kept this up for a while following university.  Then, after a few years of inactivity, I began to think about taking up running.  I started in my late thirties and only stopped when I got my most recent job, which involved a four and a half mile walk each day. I went back to running when furloughed last March. My inaptitude for driving (I had a lot of useless lessons at one time) has been beneficial in that I have had no choice but to make exercise a part of my life: public transport does not extend everywhere, and there are some places I have to walk to if I want to get there.  My parents were always keen walkers.  The conviction of my mother’s sister Dinah typifies that of a lot of people: why go anywhere on foot when you have a car? Visiting my mother, I sometimes used to walk five minutes to the newsagents and recognize in a parking bay the car of a next-door neighbour who had driven the same distance.  In my childhood, I would hear adults saying, ‘It’s hardly worth getting the car out’ over such circumstances, but it seems this attitude may have lapsed. Over the years, I have come to understand the importance of mental health as well. The culture did not care about it when I was young.  We heard about older women, with what we would now see as anxiety issues, being shamefully addicted to tranquillizers. (Even the name: ‘tranquillizers’! what a thing to give to a human being!)  I say ‘shamefully’ but it was not their fault if they were buckling under the roles assigned to them by society, and after all, it was the doctors who prescribed the drugs.  I once went into a church and saw on a tray of candles burning to send prayers up to God, one with a note that said, ‘Please help me, as my nerves are very bad again.’  I also sometimes heard female relatives or other older women talking about people they knew (almost always female) who had suffered nervous breakdowns – a condition that was to me impalpable and mysteriously conclusive. (How did you know when you were having one?  How did you get one if you wanted one?) I have been through three serious bouts of depression: from 19 to 20, at the age of 30 and again around 36, the first with suicidal thoughts, the second a prolonged period of incapacity.  I had counselling for the second and third bouts, and have had other forms at other times (hypnotherapy, group therapy), but it was not until I saw a counsellor for a year of weekly sessions following my mother’s death that I experienced any long-term benefits.  I am not suggesting that I was actively depressed beyond the years listed above, but the modes of thinking that gave rise to the depression were still very much operative. A piece of advice I found helpful from one of my earlier, apparently less successful goes of therapy was the value of daily exercise in boosting and maintaining mood. I’m 53 now: inevitably, as my body declines from its earlier peak of health, I am becoming more conscious of its appearance and functioning.  I have a developing cataract in my right eye which requires laser treatment; I have recently had an upset stomach for a few days so of course was worried I had stomach cancer; when I began to wear reading glasses, I glanced down at the wrinkles and cross-hatching of my hands as though for the first time, and thought, Where did that old man who is holding my book open for me come from? I once saw a documentary about an elderly upper class couple and their daughter who were clinging onto the dilapidated country house that had been in the family for generations, but which they could no longer afford to heat or repair.  They were obviously at the end of their tether but putting on a brave face in line with their class and upbringing.  The middle-aged daughter was discovered by the camera crew on her hands and knees, hopelessly grubbing up weeds from the drive.  That pretty much encapsulates my attitude to my health and wellbeing in the years to come, I think.  Health, wellbeing and appearance Earlier, when you asked us to define ‘a healthy body’ in five words, I came up with ‘slim, muscular (but not excessively), good skin, straight posture, clear eyes.’  Even as I was writing this, I realized I was avoiding thinking about the disabled body, and felt uncomfortable.  Can a disabled body be a healthy body?  Yes, of course; but in other cases, no, due to the nature of the disability.  Regardless, it is still a body worthy of the same respect as everyone else’s. We tend to think of conventionally attractive bodies as healthy ones, but they may be just the opposite: enviably slim women may be starving or purging themselves; enviably muscular men may be abusing steroids.  Such people look ‘right’, but the dangerous regimes to which they subject themselves don’t just damage their bodies but are also evidence of disordered thinking.  Both their physical and mental health are under attack. Activism comes in waves, and from different places at different times.  A few years ago, we heard a lot from fat activists, claiming that a person could be fat and still healthy. Undeniably, this is true, up to a certain point on the scales; beyond this, it is delusional and harmful.  Phrases such as ‘body-shaming’ and ‘body confidence’ entered the discourse; I even remember hearing that fatism was the only remaining prejudice it was publicly permissible to have.  (This was before transphobia, and before the Black Lives Matter movement reminded people that racism was far from over.)  Those of a less theoretical mindset – say, overweight middle-aged men – indignant at having a high body mass index (BMI) would fatuously argue that members of the England rugby team had the same score and they were top athletes.  While I would never want anyone to hate themselves for the body they occupy, it seems obvious that being plump or well-covered, although not ideal, is okay, whilst being obese is a health disaster waiting to happen, and should be a motivation for change.  In that sense, health (and by extension, wellbeing) is related to external appearance. Who isn’t influenced by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance?  Even if an individual holds out against them, they are still reacting to their influence. We also have to remember that ideals are not fixed and change over time: for example, modern actresses impersonating stars of the past (Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn; Marisa Tomei as Mabel Normand in Chaplin) are strikingly anachronistic in their slimness when compared to the originals.  After a lifetime of being fed images of more or less conventionally beautiful people, and internalizing these standards, I would be sad to see them superseded; I would miss them.  The only part of the film Moonraker I remember is the ending: for some reason, a crew consisting of pairs of beautiful people, 1979 style (lip gloss, big hair for both sexes), were flying into space (perhaps the villain was planning to restart the human race from the best eugenic stock on another planet), whereupon Roger Moore foiled the mission and bailed out with his leading lady. I always assumed the spaceship crashed and all the beautiful people were killed, which for twelve-year-old me considerably overshadowed the supposed happy ending of James Bond smooching his co-star. I am sure my parents were influenced by the physical ideals that were popular in their youth. My mother was a keen cinemagoer and probably wished she was more like Betty Hutton or Esther Williams (two of her favourites) when she was a child.  As she grew into adolescence, there was always her mother, a highly critical personality, to remind her that she was not measuring up.  My mother’s cousin J was a part-time model for Silhouette corsets, and had the hourglass figure admired in the 1950s; my mother was slimmer and what my grandmother would have called flat-chested in comparison.  ‘Why can’t you be more like your cousin J ?’ my grandmother would say.  ‘She has a lovely figure.’  (Years later, J confessed that her mother employed the same tactic in reverse: ‘Why can’t you be more like your cousin R ?  She’s so clever.’  God forbid that either of the girls should actually be praised for the gifts they had.) My grandmother did not deliberately set out to spoilher daughter’s confidence: the lessons she had absorbed as a child about her value in the world (as a poor, working-class girl) became a kind of conduit for the transmission of further damaging information: that decade’s somewhat oppressive standards of beauty and acceptability. Obviously, I could ‘live’ without all and every health and beauty product, but it would be uncomfortable and embarrassing to do so in modern society.  I would feel ungroomed and self-conscious if I was the only one deprived of them.  On a desert island, expectations would naturally be lower (and I might be shipwrecked by myself anyway): sunscreen to guard against skin cancer would be my first choice there. Getting ready to leave the house My parents’ routine for getting ready to go out to work (father) or to a social event (both) took place behind the closed doors of the bathroom and their bedroom, so I only ever saw glimpses of it.  My own routine is the commonplace one of washing or showering, shaving, moisturizing, applying deodorant, fiddling with my hair, dressing and so on: not very interesting."

Part 1: Corvid-19 and Time.Corvid -19 or Coronavirus as it was first called is a pandemic that started in China. There will be nogoing back to normal as the virus like similar viruses like the common cold and flu are now endemic. The future is uncertain until there is an effective vaccine. When is the vaccine coming? Probably the first to get the vaccine will be the Health workers in the first 2 quarters of 2021. The politicians have not listened to the scientists and have delayed the vaaccine. The politicians are opnly interested in headlines, short term fixes and votes. In the USA the vaccine has been deliberately delayed by American politicians so that their own American companies can catch up with the front runner which is still the Oxford Vaccine produced by the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in Oxford and manufactured by AstraZeneca globally.Rythm and routine day.The old normal has gone forever. There will be infuture a new normal which will evolve over time. So my past daily routines of having a coffe at Starbucks or Costa are now gone. I may coffe at home. Pre Corvid I would get my hair cut every 5-6 weeks at a hair saloon. Now I cyt my own hair with some hair clippers. I also have stopped daily visits to the pool at my local gym. Not doing any of the above for fear of catching the virus has meant I have saved lots of money but I have lost my social contacts. The coffee shops, hairdressers and gym all have totally inadequate setups to cope with the pandemic. So there is no way until at least after the vaccine is available that I will return. In fact its ikely that I will never return to these establishments. That was the old normal. The new normal is very different but cheaper and better in some ways. Nothing lasts forever.The government id nothing for 5 weeks when the virus was known. After this the government did too little too late and everything, yes everthing they touched they completely messed up. So the supplly of PPE ( protective medical garments gloves and masks) never arrived on time, were in short supply, did not meet the correct standards. Plus the goovemment throughout the whole crisis lied and spun the news. Eg they counted 1 pair of gloves (one for left hand and one for right hand ) as 2 complete items of PPE. So in fact there were half the number of sets of gloves available. The Track and trace app for phons was scrapped and restarted as a new app. But the app does not fully work some folk get 60 calls a day instead of one follow up call. Testing has been totally inadequate and the government spun the numbers. For eaxmple the government counted tens of thousands of tests posted out some with no return envelops and without bar cades to those needed testing. It countes these as tests completed. Numerous times government targets for testing were fiddled to make it look as if the target had been met. In all cases the targets were never met. The quality of the testing was done on the cheap and many false positives resulted. Private companies I set up their own testing as the NHS testing was basically unreliable cheap and nasty to adminieter. Instead of slavia testing cotton wool buds up the nose were used. Government advice has been too little too late, conflicting and naive. Boris and his government have been bad exaples and incompetent.1		Cumming Boris's advier broke the rules several times. In addition I believe Boris has looked after his friends in the supply chain. Why else would the governrnent order sub standard materials? The government have largely ignored scientific advice and Boris and Cummings have leaned on the Chief health minister to put th economy before lives. The Conservative government have lied throughout the pandemic and continue to be incompetent and base decisions not on scientific advice and real data.M5015, Male,64,married,Cambridge,retired property landlord.I have taken the opportunity of the lockdown to complete my list of DIY jobs and make things at home more comfortable. The garden is the best that it has ever been due to regular maintenance. My finances are better in part due to spending a lot less on fuel for thecar . I was driving 2,000- 2,500 miles a month. Now I drive less than 400 miles a month. I do not shop anymore evbrything I buy is done on line. All groceries now are home delivered from up to 6 suppliers. Tesco and Waitrose are my main suppliers.I have spent a lot of time reading about stocks and shares and doing a small amount of investing. This is my new work as I am retired.I used to spend 2-3 months of every year away in hotels in the UK and around the world. Now I never stay away. Once the vaccine comes then I hope to have a holiday away. But until then I will just have day trips out ion the UK. I used to do 2 or 3 long haul flights a year before the pandemic. Now I don't expect I will travel long haul until 2022 or even 2024.The travel and hotel industry globally has been decimated by the pandemic. HomelifeEveryday is basiaclly the same, work ,cook, clean. I regularly do not know what day of the week it is. At the start of the pandemic every day felt like a Sunday. Now slowly weekdays are emerging.I am expecting the pandemic through the second wave to be much worse than the first wave. So I expect to go out less and the government very lkate in the day to invoke a partial lockdown But this is not what is needed. A full lock down is the only scientifically correct way forward based on the data. Boris will just perpetuate the pandemic in the UK by doing half measures and trying to please his business mates.Media & TechnologyZoom and Whatsapp have been indispensible to keep in touch with folk. Keeping in touch with computer iliterate generally older fol over 60 has been almost impossible. Video conferencing has boomed. This will continue. We wont go back to letters and a basic phone.Waiting.Generally I have not waited for anything major. I have correctly assumed that any service I needed to wait for wa not going to come back within 12 months and probably never.In the early months I stood in queues outside supermarkets to do shopping. Theis was very dangerous as many shoppers did not observe the social distancing. So I gave up shopping in person and now only do shopping on line."

My wife was an early volunteer on the Oxford vaccine trials, and at the registration stage had one or perhaps two PCR tests administered at the base hospital for the project in Glasgow. Thereafter, for a period of several months, she undertook a weekly self-administered PCR test which was sent by priority mail to the hospital each Wednesday; she would normally have the result by e-mail the following day. She had no ill-effects from the two vaccinations which she had. The trials used ‘random double-blind’ protocols, and we now know that she was not given the trial vaccine, but a well-established and safe meningitis vaccine. My own role in these events was to construct the pre-formed cardboard box – a very standard process which she however found annoyingly fiddly – and to ensure that everything was included and safely packed. Our only other connection, was when our 3-year-old granddaughter [EH] had to be quickly tested after two other children had been sent home from nursery with suspect symptoms. Thankfully, all was well. I have commented [in a 213-page diary of the pandemic from January-July 2020] on accounts of the Test and Trace Scheme, its grotesque costs, and the idiocy of using inexperienced private companies [ergo poorly-trained staff] instead of the highly qualified local health authority staff. Without doubt, there will be very many people with direct experience of the trials and tribulations. Many will perhaps be travellers by air, with whom I have very little sympathy – does no-one remember the speed with which the virus was spread thanks to the lack of security at airports in the early months of 2020? I note from today’s news that in the last three months £500 million has been paid to private companies for Covid-19 tests by air passengers arriving in the UK. Surely another area for diligent inquiry . . . . * * * * * 12th August 2021 Page 1 of 1"

However, I was up to my eyes in writing a huge diary on the Covid-19 pandemic for M-O [see reference in this Directive, Part 2] and my wife beat me to it. I assumed that they might not want two people from the same household (which was a wrong assumption) and I let the matter lapse, while my wife has continued on the volunteer programme. I also applied a few months ago to volunteer on a trial of a â€˜boosterâ€™ vaccine, but the dates of my two Oxford-AstraZeneca inoculations did not match the project requirements. I had my first vaccination at our local Health Centre, on Sunday 7th February, and my second at the same venue on Sunday 18th April. Both appointments were triggered by a telephone call from our local GP surgery, and the vaccinations were administered by a nurse. The entire surgery was transformed into dedicated entrance and exit â€˜routesâ€™ through the building, with extra volunteers regularly stationed to give directions into and out of temporary vaccination rooms; very efficient. I suffered no side-effects whatsoever from either inoculation, and neither did my wife from hers. [In the vaccine trial â€“ which was â€˜random double-blindâ€™ â€“ she had not been given the actual trial vaccine, but two doses of a well understood and safe meningitis vaccine; this fact had to be confirmed in a complex relaxation of the trial records before she could be vaccinated]. We have always followed the precautionary approach to government guidelines. This despite chronic confusion from Westminster over â€˜messagingâ€™. Guidelines, rules, laws, advice; it was seldom clear â€“ even to the police â€“ which if any had the force of law; and then there was the huge chasm between law and enforcement. Much of this was inevitable, and few would wish to be responsible for dealing with such an emergency, but clarity should have been recognised as a vital watchword from the beginning. The Scottish government was considerably better at such matters, but was always hemmed-in by edicts coming from London. Fractured opinion was everywhere â€“ politicians, scientists, â€˜advisorsâ€™, journalists, â€˜nay-sayersâ€™, conspiracy theorists, troublemakers and anti-vaxxers. There was huge confusion in the public mind about which part of the science community to listen to; Sage, â€˜Independent Sageâ€™, Nervtag, and other more ad hoc groups of scientists who were not on any of the â€˜officialâ€™ science advisory bodies. And â€˜scienceâ€™ was multi-faceted; not just epidemiologists and virologists and respiratory medicine specialists and thousands of exhausted hospital staff, but computer â€˜modellersâ€™, psychologists, behavioural scientists, and many more stretching into the distance. Exciting, but tricky. This has been a hideous experience for everyone, but also fascinating . . Now that Scotland and England have adopted nearly-normal scenarios for most parts of the economy, we are still cautious, mask-wearing on transport and in enclosed spaces, and adhering to some degree of â€˜distancingâ€™. No-one should assume Covid-19 has gone away; a pandemic is not over till the entire globe is free, and that is very far from the case. The scenes of uncontrolled â€˜normalityâ€™ in nightclubs are frankly appalling, and I am highly sceptical â€“ disapproving, really â€“ of the hysterical return to flying [the perfect vector of viral spread, which did so much damage in the early months of 2020]. The Guardian today [12 August] reports that in the last three months air passengers to the UK have spent at least Â£500 million on PCR Covid-19 tests from private companies. Page 1 of 2 H.1541 Male, married, age 76; two adult children; retired film editor & sometime writer; Central Scotland I have no reason whatsoever to fear the safety of the vaccine; it has been well-tested, authorised by rigorous regulatory bodies, and many millions of doses have been safely administered, with few side-effects. Of course, the vaccines have been miraculously developed extremely quickly in the face of a disastrous pandemic; nothing can have a cast-iron guarantee. What does concern me is that all the promises of generous and rapid international co-operation in vaccine supply to other countries â€“ particularly in the Third World â€“ have not been honoured. There are reports today that the government are ordering an initial 35 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in preparation for a â€˜boosterâ€™ campaign in the UK next year. This will surely increase public and scientific doubts about this being a necessity, or whether it can be morally justified in the light of very low vaccination rates in the developing countries. By and large, the vaccine programmes in the UK have been very successful; of course there have been glitches, but in such a vast operation those are unavoidable. There are remaining arguments about the various younger age-groups, when and if they should be inoculated; other vulnerable groups also require more discrete, targeted arrangements. The matter of vaccine â€˜passportsâ€™ has not been well handled, either in the UK or internationally. In the UK, the idea was mooted some time ago and firmly ruled out; now it is creeping back, in vague and uncoordinated ways. It seems that individual countries across Europe are now set to â€˜do their own thingâ€™, which seems hopeless. There are undoubtedly worries about â€˜second-class citizensâ€™ unless this is dealt with properly. Even the simple idiocy of constant references to digital certificates for smart-phones. What about the many who donâ€™t have smart-phones, or donâ€™t want to take them on holiday . . . . ? Then there is admission to galleries, venues, restaurants . . . this could be a real nightmare of disenfranchisement . . . . Compulsory vaccination anyone? In general I disapprove of compulsory medication, perhaps most recently proposed â€“ and denied -some years ago in the proposal to administer fluoride in drinking water, for the supposed benefit of dental health. There are general public rights to refuse medication and treatment, although these can be legally side-stepped in the case of individuals constrained under the mental health acts, or very young children under other legal procedures. For the population at large however, there has never been an appetite to support compulsory vaccination. Nevertheless, Covid-19 has given us a glimpse of a genuinely aggressive global killer capable of endless mutation. People have a new awareness of the relevance of â€˜publicâ€™ and â€˜globalâ€™ health, and it is possible to imagine a time and circumstance â€“ much worse that our present one Â­when compulsory vaccination could be advisable or an existential necessity, especially if the supply of vaccines across the world is not massively improved. * * * * * 12th August 2021 Page 2 of 2"

But the nurse was absolutely amazing and fantastic and careful and helped me so very much. I went to the Brighton Centre, the atmosphere was quite clinical and industrial. But the nurses I had were so absolutely fantastic I felt so looked after and actually safe, especially when panicking. Made me feel so happy after that we have so many amazing healthcare workers looking after us and having the NHS in the UK, and more angry at their denial of a 15% pay increase to combat their over 10 year pay stagnation. I travelled by bus to the Sea Life Centre and walked the rest of the way, it was a hot day. I received the Moderna vaccine, was kind of hoping for the Pfizer vaccine, but both are RNA vaccines, a completely new and safer technology for the vaccine and truly groundbreaking technology behind them, Oxford is less effective and relies upon viral injection which is totally safe but is the way weâ€™ve been making vaccines for hundreds of years. I had no symptoms that day of my injection, just a sore arm, the arm continued being sore for like 5 days afterwards, headaches started the next day and continued for 2 more days. That was about it, perhaps a little dizziness once, but that may have been due to something else I think. I am still distancing where I can, I donâ€™t wear a mask at work due to exemption but I do where I can (dependent on short durations) and cannot stay at home because of work. Otherwise I do what I can and I definitely havenâ€™t been going out more as most people have, especially because of the stupid football. The vaccine is totally safe, Iâ€™d bet more than my life on it. I have explained the tech behind it to my mum and even strangers and even cited sources. It is 100% safe, some risk of anaphylactic shock as with everything, but that is why there is 30 minutes of monitoring immediately after the vaccine to combat any ill effects. My mum works in a care home and refused the vaccine when offered early, I decried her for doing something so stupid, she later caught covid and recovered and then only chose the vaccine when forced due to keep her job. I did all I could to explain everything about the vaccine. If you have not received a Covid-19 vaccine N/A To answer some of these, I booked the vaccine as soon as I found out how to, on the same day as the highest uptake of people to sign up, our age group, younger generations, which I was proud of, for showing how we are taking this more seriously, the restrictions, the costs, the effects and the fixes. I was hoping for Pfizer for it has a slightly higher efficacy than Moderna. Was not wanting Oxford because of lower efficacy, it was also the one with blood clot risks, but even the risks was something like 0.001%, which is less risk than most taken on a daily basis. The vaccine programme In the UK the vaccine prioritised the elderly and health workers and carers, and moved down the ages. I found a lot of the information on the vaccine from YouTubers like SciShow, ASAP Science and other educational YouTubers Iâ€™ve relied on for probably a decade now for information about the vaccines themselves, and used UK government and NHS guidelines for information about the UK vaccine programme information. I am angry about the anti-vaxers. I am against vaccine passports until everyone has been given the choice for the vaccine, and then vaccine passports should be implemented to travel, go to the theatre, shops, bars, and everywhere else until everyone has to be vaccinated. It shouldn't be optional unlike you cannot take the vaccine due to health risk. Making vaccines mandatory As mentioned earlier, I don't disagree with use of vaccine passports within the UK so long as everyone has been given access to the vaccine, as for travel, I think itâ€™s a wise idea to have covid vaccines a prerequisite for travel, but I think travel should still be reduced outside of a country and heavily restricted and monitored, otherwise the risk is too great and the variants too risky and varied. Overall I disagree with travel outside of oneâ€™s own country for the exception of, for example a doctor travelling if theyâ€™re the only one who can save a patientâ€™s life, or for donating blood or stem cells or life saving treatment. Otherwise I think itâ€™s selfish, of course with other exceptions, but I think these exceptions for travel to be justified are few and far between and should be decided by a government panel and stricter on the rich getting away with it because of their money with greater fines for those who travel without being allowed to."

I am, however, writing as a private citizen (not as a representative of a particular organisation or political party) and have not undertaken an extensive trawl of the data for the following text. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine I took a trip across the river from my town to receive my first dose of vaccine towards in the end of May in the next town, due to a lack of appointments at my local vaccination centre. Upon arriving spectacularly early (I was worried about the reliability of the boat, given the weather the proceeding day) I was delighted to be immediately shown into the vaccination centre. The setup was incredibly efficient, if slightly ramshackle. I had to enter the back of the building down a narrow alley, within which pieces of wood had been laid on the floor to stop us getting muddy feet. A tent-like structure had been placed next to the door to provide shelter. My name was ticked off a list by a volunteer and I had to wait mere minutes before been shown to the booth within which I received my vaccine (Pfizer) and the associated documentation to go with it. (At this stage I was disappointed to not get a vaccination sticker, which my husband had received with his first dose!) I was then asked to wait in another room, within which I took my obligatory vaccine selfie (hah!), to be posted on social media and sent to my vaccine-sceptic parent. Had a lovely chat with one of the volunteers and noticed that nearly working at the centre was either a migrant to the UK or a descendent of a migrant. What on earth would the UK health system do without migrants? The atmosphere in the centre was joyful-you could see that people were happy behind their face coverings. Aside from a bruised arm, experienced no side effects whatsoever. Tweeted repeatedly about this as the next few days progressed, in order to reassure friends. To be honest, I was barely worried about side effects from the vaccine at all-the data are exceedingly promising in this area and I do not tend to react to vaccines. I volunteered for one of the vaccine trials in the summer of 2020 (although did not meet the screening criteria) as I know how good safety data have to be before scientists are allowed to get vaccines into people! Given the data on the impact of the vaccine separately on reducing my likelihood of picking up the infection and transmitting it I am glad I have had my first dose and look forward to my second. Saying this, effectiveness is not perfect in either case and there is insufficient information on how the data translate into real-world scenarios (does 85% efficacy mean 85% of people are 100% protected and 15% of people have no protection, or does 85% efficacy mean 100% of people are 85% protected, for example). Even aside from what the law allows, it seems wise to maintain face coverings and social distancing, and work do not really want me back in the office yet anyway! To be honest, given data on face coverings and reduced influenza transmission, now I am used to them I am likely to keep using them in spaces with lots of people for the foreseeable future. The vaccine programme In my area of England, friends of mine in their 80s and 90s were very rapidly called up to be vaccinated at the start of this year by letter, either from their GP practice or, slightly later, one of the mass vaccination facilities. The slot for their second dose was told to them at their first appointment, although this was often moved earlier as the policy changed from 12 S5767, female, 36, married, Gravesend, academic researcher weeks to the second dose to eight, on the basis of vaccine supply and updates to the underlying data/pandemic picture. By about March, the system had switched to online booking of your first and second doses simultaneously. My age bracket was finally eligible to book about four weeks ago (I write mid-June 2021) and I got to have my first dose a week and a half after I booked. Sadly-and perhaps amusingly-my trip to the vaccination centre involved having to take a boat, as the local centre had run out of slots. The programme has been run as well as possible, given what the data were telling us at the time-it was critical to vaccinate those most at risk of hospitalisation and death first, as well as key workers so society could keep running. As much as I would have liked to have been dosed earlier, I strongly appreciate that. Population needs have to come before individual needs. I do find it fascinating how the vast majority of people who have been vaccinated can tell you which brand of vaccine they have had, a topic on which they probably did not care a jot for jabs received prior to the pandemic. My information about the vaccines come directly from scientific papers, pre-prints (our reliance on which has been a revolution in scientific publishing of the pandemic era), information from colleagues, and reports from public health organisations. This is a simple necessity of my work. I try to be a conveyor of scientifically-reliable and easily-understood scientific evidence to friends. Making vaccines mandatory There seems little doubt that COVID-19 is here forever now, i.e. the concept of global eradication is an impossibility. With a sufficient disconnection between infection and hospitalisation and deaths brought on by the vaccination programme (and hopeful eventual advancements in treatment), we can hope to make it a controllable infection, like influenza. In this context (i.e. that vaccination is a critical plank of public health control of the pandemic, particularly when the economic impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions is taken into account), and given concerns about vaccine-driven, immunity-driven, or otherwise arising variants, the suggestion of vaccine passports is completely understandable. Such passports (certification) for yellow fever vaccination have existed since the 1930s-40s and are used today to determine who can enter specific nations, so there is clear precedent. Several considerations need to be taken into account when putting such passports into practise. Firstly, it may not be possible for some individuals to be vaccinated e.g. because they have severe allergic reactions to the contents of vaccines. Secondly, the unequal (understatement) global roll-out of vaccine doses and thus the discriminatory effect vaccinebased entry requirements will place on global population movements. Placing a requirement on vaccination for entrance to different forms of mass gatherings, or specific social settings, is complex. If infection levels are driven down low enough in the UK and test and trace is improved, this provides a very different context to the question versus high infection levels and problems with testing. Certain sections of British society are more vaccine sceptic than others; this can be linked to problematic dynamics between healthcare services and different racial groups, for example. Thus, to ban such individuals from particular social settings due to their belief system becomes increasingly problematic unless we are willing to address underlying racism within society. S5767, female, 36, married, Gravesend, academic researcher I am no believer in mandatory vaccination, largely because I am influenced by the work of excellent colleagues in the vaccine hesitant/anti-vaxx space. Far better that we address underlying sources of concern, which stick approaches often simply serve to increase."

My husband drove me to the centre. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Astra Zeneca How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? Fine. I did not experience any side effects. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? I continue to follow the guidelines. The latest guidelines and timescales seem reasonable. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? I have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine. My family have followed developments closely and read scientific articles on the subject. If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine Will you accept an invitation to book the vaccine when it is offered to you? Please share your motivations for your decision. Are you hoping to receive a particular vaccine? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) H7289 Will you follow the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19? (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive the vaccine. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). The programme is being delivered by priority group, and then by age. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. From a variety of sources including the government briefings and the NHS website. Iâ€™ve also attended a zoom talk by an immunologist and I read any relevant articles in New Scientist etc. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. Whilst I would probably support vaccine passports for foreign travel, especially air travel where space and recycled air is an issue, I think it would be more problematic if these were to be required in places like pubs. Antivaxxers -while the vaccine remains a question of choice there will always be those who decline to have it. I suspect vaccine passports will create similar resistance especially where these two groups are synonymous. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? Whilst I recognise this is not a question with an easy answer, my personal opinion is that any vaccine that eliminates a life-threatening disease, and that has a proven safety record, should be mandatory if the recipientâ€™s health will not be adversely affected by itâ€™s application."

Part 2. Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Casting my mind back to when I did my nurse training, we were taught that health is ‘more than just the absence of disease’. That good health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing. Defined in this way, wellbeing is seen as synonymous with health. But I think that ‘wellbeing’ as a concept distinct from health, or often paired with it, is something we have seen used increasingly over the years. It perhaps suggests an active pursuit of health, doing things that will make us feel good and that are pleasurable. The first five words that come to my mind associated with “a healthy body” are: functioning, nourished, strong, renewal, mine. Identity Surely our gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation must influence our experiences of health and wellbeing, whether we’re aware of it or not. Being a white, heterosexual, middle class (I’m wincing at labelling myself by class…!) woman, along with certain cultural norms, gives me advantages in my access to health services and in my health and wellbeing. For example, as a woman, I’m more likely to seek healthcare than my male counterparts. As a white woman, I am half as likely as a black woman (in the UK) to be obese – I was shocked to see this disparity in the figures released from Public Health England last week. There are no complications for me in taking up cervical screening, but for a trans man who has a cervix, that must be difficult. For T and I, having children was straightforward (in terms of conceiving and pregnancy and birth); for same sex couples who want children, their experiences will be very different. There will be multiple ways in which my identity affects my health. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have no idea when I will first have been aware of these concepts. But my mum had wanted to be a doctor and, when she found that path blocked, she worked in a hospital pathology laboratory. When she did teacher training later in life, biology was her main subject during the training (though she went on to teach infants). Health (and illness!) would always have been topics of interest in my household and Mum had books on medical topics. Mum was the person primarily responsible for my health and wellbeing when I was young. I don’t remember conversations about health when I was young, but Mum must have educated me about health. She would have told me why it was important to clean my teeth regularly, for example, and I was taken for regular dental check-ups (and fillings when needed – my own children didn’t need any fillings, but I was a child of the ‘60s and no doubt had too much sugar, and maybe not enough fluoride!). I wonder what information I might have got from my sisters too, who were nine and eleven years older than me. I do remember being fascinated by a diagram in one sister’s biology book – one she had had to put together herself, which had flaps to lift to show internal organs! I was educated in road safety as a young child. For a time, when we lived in London (so before I was seven), I was a member of the Tufty Club, which was a hugely popular club designed to teach children about road safety. Tufty was a squirrel and had other animal friends, teaching us about road safety. I think I was taken to a church hall for meetings of this club – my memories of that are very hazy. I certainly had a Tufty board game. Later on, there was the Green Cross Code road safety campaign, and I expect I saw tv adverts about this. We did get some health education in school, though I have few memories of this. I remember a dental health session, where we were given disclosing tablets to show up the plaque on our teeth. In the first year of secondary school (a girls’ grammar school), we had a couple of sex education classes. Our male biology teacher went rather red on the top of his bald head and left the class, to be replaced a few moments later by a female teacher! As well as the explanations of relevant anatomy and physiology, there was a question box, where we were invited to post anonymous questions for the teacher to answer. I wonder now how much we already knew. I don’t remember any one significant conversation or other source of information about this. Friends and teen magazines – ‘Jackie’ especially but there were plenty of others I read when I could, like ‘My Guy’ and ‘Blue Jeans’, were probably my main source of information about things relating to puberty and adolescence. I loved those magazines! This was all long before the internet. Also popular in my class at school was a book, ‘Are you there God, it’s me, Margaret’ by Judy Blume, in which the main character and her friends discuss and agonise over the kind of things that preoccupied us, like starting periods and getting a bra. I don’t remember coming across any discussion of illegal drugs, oddly. Maybe that wasn’t mentioned in school. I guess it might have featured in the tv programme ‘Grange Hill’, which was perhaps another source of information for me about teen health and wellbeing issues. Key moments I’m not sure when I first became aware of bodily changes associated with puberty. They were much discussed among us girls at my all girls grammar school, and there was status that went with having breasts (bigger was regarded as better!) and having started menstruating. I was late with both, not starting my periods until I was 14. I was in a hurry to get breasts but had a long wait! I find it strange, looking back, that when I did start my periods it was months before I told my mum, yet she was unembarrassed and straightforward about these things; I don’t know why I would have felt shy about it. I would certainly have told my friends and would have been pleased that I’d started, at last! The teen magazines’ problem pages too were full of puberty-related problems and I no doubt got some information (and probably was influenced in my attitudes!) from those. I don’t really know which moments or rituals are significant for young men, having not had brothers or sons, and no close friendships with boys before I left school. Among the girls I knew, I’m not aware that there were any rituals around beginning menstruation or getting the first bra when I was a teenager, and when my daughters were teenagers we didn’t mark these moments in any way, but I know that these things are marked by some people and in different ways. My mum remembered being taken by her Godmother to get her first bra; her Godparents were sad to be childless and Mum had a close relationship with her Godmother. Growing older I think I’ve always done things to actively maintain my mental and physical health, though in my youth my focus was probably more on my physical health. I suspect that the way we think about mental health, and certainly the place it now has in conversation, has changed a fair bit in my lifetime. I’ve always done things for enjoyment, because they make me feel good, relax me and so on, but I doubt I would have thought about this in terms of doing things for my mental health. I’ve done plenty of things that have benefited my health, but not necessarily with that being the primary aim. For example, I did some sports clubs after school because I enjoyed them, and as a non-driver I have always walked a lot to transport myself from place to place! In terms of things done for the purpose of maintaining my health, the types of things will have changed over time. When I first moved away from home I lived a short train journey away from my sister and would often stay with her for a night or two. This was a time (1983-’87) when aerobics classes were popular, and I would sometimes go to hers with her. I sometimes swam in those days too, as we had a swimming pool in the basement of one of the nurses homes. I don’t think I did a great deal of exercise during those years though, as I was on my feet all day on the wards and did other things with my time off! At university, I played the occasional game of squash but didn’t do much exercise I suppose. At different times since I have done dance classes (flamenco!), and a variety of exercise classes, including Zumba and Jazzercise. I haven’t been terribly good at sticking to it though. When we first went into lockdown, last March, our Jazzercise classes moved online, and that was good for a while, but there were sometimes connection problems, and I decided to stop it after a few months. For the past four months I have been doing a weekly Pilates class online, run by J, with whom I did my nurse training, and she then trained as a physiotherapist. I’ve started this with a view to maximising my musculoskeletal health, conscious that my body is ageing and wanting to do what I can to stay healthy. I’m enjoying it and feeling the benefits. I am very aware of, and grateful for, my good health. Over the past couple of years, I have found that one knee is sometimes sore, and my hips can be painful during exercise. I had a one-to-one online consultation with J, as I wanted to understand what I should and shouldn’t be doing in terms of exercise and these weak areas, and that was really helpful. I intend to keep the Pilates going as long as possible; I’m fortunate that I can afford to pay for such things to benefit my health. I’ve always tried to eat fairly healthily, whilst also being rather cavalier about eating sweet things. I have tried to curb this in recent years as I have put on weight with the menopause, though I’m still a healthy weight (according to the BMI calculator). I did different things in pregnancy to benefit my health and that of my babies, beginning with taking folic acid supplements pre-conception to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the baby. I was very conscious of what to eat, and avoid eating; hazards in pregnancy from other things like disease transmitted by farm animals, and did pregnancy yoga classes in my first pregnancy. I was very healthy through both pregnancies and enjoyed being pregnant. I am employed by the National Health Service and work for the UK centre of a global organisation that produces summaries of health research, and I write about health evidence, so I am immersed in information about health! I also have the knowledge and skills to think critically about health claims – in the media, for example. Personally, I will sometimes use the NHS website for information about health. For example, that was my first port of call to find out the latest information on which symptoms should prompt a Covid test, and how to get one. Aside from particular times, such as pregnancy, I think I am probably more aware of my body now than when I was younger. Being a nurse gave me a heightened awareness of health, and an appreciation of my good health, as a young woman. But at my age, I see contemporaries with poorer health and indeed I’m very aware of the gulf between my health experiences and those of my husband over the past decade and more. I’m also aware of the changes in my body through menopause and the need to work harder at maintaining my health and wellbeing. As I age, I hope I will be able to keep doing things to benefit my health and will enjoy good health for a long, long time. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think external appearance does have an impact on health and, in particular, wellbeing. We know that things like skin conditions, scars and prominent birth marks can negatively impact people’s mental health, confidence and self-esteem, along with many other things that depart from the rules of symmetry or beauty ideals, from things that fall within ‘normal’ (very large or small breasts, for example, or a prominent jaw) to those that are related to syndromes or the loss of a limb, for instance. There can be few people who are completely free of influence from popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance, though this will vary between cultures, between people and in oneself at different life stages. Changes over time relate to aspects of fashion – hairstyles, make-up, clothes and so on. But also to shifts in our understanding; the use of thin female models has been slow to change but the fashion industry has been criticised for using models who are too thin, because of heightened awareness on eating disorders – both in terms of the beauty standard they set and the problems of anorexia amongst models themselves as well as those who aspire to look like them. It’s becoming more common (though the change is slow) to see mainstream brands use models who are older, bigger, or – occasionally – have visible differences, such as models with Downs Syndrome, though the latter is something I’ve only seen in children’s modelling. I’m sure my parents too would have been influenced by popular notions of beauty and physical appearance, following fashions in clothing and hairstyles, cosmetics or grooming habits. My desert island item would be moisturiser for my face. I don’t mind which brand, but my skin feels so dry without it. I could live without it of course, but I’d prefer to have it! Getting ready to leave the house Mum would always make her face up before work and sometimes I would be chatting to her while she did it. Not a long process. Moisturiser, foundation, face powder, eyebrows plucked as needed and enhanced with a pencil, eyeshadow (I think!), and lipstick. Also perfume. I can’t picture Mum using mascara, but maybe she did as a younger woman. Getting ready to go out for the evening, or to host a dinner party, would see my stepfather showered, shaved, after shave applied, hair slicked back (with what I’ve no idea). Mum would apply eyeshadow on these occasions, as well as the rest of her usual make up. She’d use perfume and wear jewellery, and a carefully chosen outfit. I don’t remember Mum having to do much with her hair on a day-to-day basis. She had good hair, right to the end of her life, and had a cut and colour every few weeks, letting it go grey only in the last few years. I give very little time to getting ready to go out, either for work or socialising, though I do like my clothes and take some care over what I buy and how I look. I love nice shoes/boots and bags too. I have never worn much make-up; have never been someone who wouldn’t leave the house without make-up on, and I feel I’m not very skilled at applying it. Some of my friends feel the same, and we have remarked on how different it is for our children, who have become much more skilled that we’ve ever been, thanks to instruction from YouTube and other social media. I have a low-maintenance haircut, so not much to do there other than wash it every couple of days and then blow dry it or just let it dry, depending on time and inclination. Since the first lockdown, almost a year ago, I haven’t bothered with make­up! I will again once I go back to the office. My routine was to use a light foundation, mascara and lipstick. Sometimes I wore eye shadow and sometimes not. I like necklaces and have worn those even in lockdown, depending on my outfit. I find I have stopped wearing earrings, strangely, and this is a mistake, as they are now irritating my ears!"

I had been in contact with one such friend, albeit outdoors, the day before she became symptomatic. As a result, and because I care for my vulnerable partner, I began to panic (and really panic) that I may have caught COVID, too. I felt ill with anxiety and knew that I would not be able to cope with that until the situation was clear. I therefore booked a PCR test at the local testing centre using my phone, and the link our council provided for testing, and was allocated a slot the same day. The testing centre was not far from my home, a 30-minute walk maybe, and it took the form of a huge tent erected near the massive Tesco in our area. I was one of only two people there getting tested, and was greeted by a chain of staff – each of them had a role to perform (checking my appointment time, showing me the way etc.). Inside the tent, another member of staff took me to the testing booth where the kit was laid out, alongside a mirror and written instructions. The member of staff stood away from me and talked me through what I had to do. The staff member was quite young, and very kind and friendly. The process of testing – swabbing my throat and nose – made me gag and sneeze a great deal and I felt pretty bad for the staff member having to see and hear this. I made a comment to this effect and he said that it was fine, that some people have actually been sick. I told him I was really impressed that he had taken on this job. I was extremely nervous and shaky but the staff member was fantastic. I then handed in my sample and walked home. I got my results, via text message, within 48 hours. The results were negative, thankfully. I felt extremely relieved and able to relax again, and also grateful to have the service, which was accessible to me without much trouble. Everyday Testing I work in a library within a large university, serving thousands of students. I also work in a shared office and, although I am working partly at home and partly onsite, I still am often in the same space as others. Our workplace has encouraged us to use lateral flow tests twice weekly, which they have facilitated by providing the tests. For a number of weeks, these were available at a desk by the main door to the building. They are now being given out in a different location but are still accessible. I have, therefore, for a number of months now (since May 2021) been testing myself the morning of each day when I am due onsite. K7066 Female, 50, In a Relationship, London, Librarian They are always LTF tests although sometimes different brands with differentials on how long you wait for results, and how many times you swab the nose or throat. I still find it an unpleasant process, and gag and sneeze, but am now quite quick at administering the test. I have also taken the tests if I have met up with friends outside of work, again just before I meet them. I know that I benefit from taking them as I can (relatively) confidently go out into public feeling I am not transmitting COVID and hopefully that means others benefit, too. I always have at least two boxes of 7 tests in the flat, but currently have enough to keep me going for six months. This is because I walked past a council stall in the park, where they were giving out the boxes of LTF tests, and they gave me a bag full. Views on Testing The government Test and Trace programme has seemed to be pretty half-hearted, particularly as it is not compulsory. I have the app on my phone and was checking in to places I visited, certainly during the first phases of post-lockdown opening of cafes etc. Recently, however, I have noticed that the log-in information/QR codes are not so visible in most places so I have to admit I have not logged-in so frequently. The app is on, however, and scanning. I am using the overground trains occasionally and, so far, have been fortunate not to be 'pinged' although friends who use the tube and buses have been contacted pretty regularly. I know that many people have removed the app from their phones as it was affecting attendance at work, particularly when they themselves were not symptomatic. A friend was pinged through the wall of her home, for instance, having not been in contact with her neighbour. It is better now that a negative PCR test means that no isolation is required. I am aware that the LTF tests are less reliable than the PCR tests so I do wonder how accurate they are, and worry that I could be walking around with COVID and not know it. Having said that, I also read that they are better at picking up COVID if you are symptomatic, and that has seemed to be the case with friends and family who have had COVID accurately predicted by LTF tests. Whilst I am alert to this risk, I don't really know what else we can do – I would rather take the LTF tests than not, and take the chance that they are correct."

I was so pleased and relieved to get the first one. I am a carer so was in vaccine priority 6. I went to a centre built for the purpose, adjoining a local health centre. The vaccine was administered by NHS staff although the general admin side of the process was run by local volunteers. All the staff were amazing and the experience was swift, efficient and caring. There was a strangely buoyant atmosphere and the staff were all cheery which helped. I actually had my first jab given to me by a doctor who was onsite to oversee tricky cases â€“ as I have had sepsis in the past, I was referred to him for a consultation first in case I was at risk of serious side effects, but all was well and I had the jab with no ill effects. I had been anxious about this somewhat but I was really hoping I would be allowed to have the vaccine so was very relieved. I didn't need to see him for the second jab, which was administered by a nurse. I was given the Oxford vaccine, and I walked to and from the centre (it was local). After the first vaccine I felt fine for a few hours but at bedtime I began to feel shivery and was then ill (aches, shivers, weak and in bed) for a day and tired for a second day. After that, all was well. I had no bad side effects from the second jab beyond a sore arm. I am still following all the government guidelines about social distancing and mask wearing as I still feel very nervous; I dread catching the virus and passing it to my vulnerable partner. We both are double-jabbed so I know we are much safer now, but I also know all vaccines are imperfect. I recently heard that the TV presenter Andrew Marr had a bad bout of COVID despite being double-jabbed, for instance. In the background as I type this is the latest update from the government about July 19th and the opening-up of society. I feel very nervous that the rules about social distancing, masks and returning to working onsite are changing and that all these are left to individuals and companies to decide. I think it is ridiculous to remove the mandatory mask-wearing â€“ I had hoped that this would remain until at least all adults were double-jabbed. I am not worried about the vaccine and safety â€“ my life was saved when I had sepsis thanks to very strong medicines and, as a result, I am not very concerned about pharmaceutical side effects. I think it is a risk I am willing to take and have been grateful many times in my life to have been given medication, including the coronavirus vaccine. The Vaccine Programme The vaccine programme in my area seems to be really efficient and has been organised in many different ways. Initially, when dealing solely with the most vulnerable and the priority tiers, we were contacted by our GP who sent us links to book appointments at selected local clinics. The one I went to was constructed for the purpose by the army and the first week at least was staff by the army (my partner had his first jab the week it opened in January 2021 and the army administered his K7066 Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian first vaccine). By my partner's second vaccine and for both mine, the administration of the vaccines was by NHS staff. Non-vulnerable people were booking their vaccines via the government's website and / or the council website and were generally going to larger venues to have the vaccine or to some local chemists. On top of that, recently, there have been specialist clinics for particular community groups who have perhaps not taken-up the vaccine so quickly, or now for younger adults. These have taken place in the clinic I went to and also in large venues such as at football stadiums. These are drop-ins so don't require appointments. Equally, throughout, if the local clinic has had any unused vaccine doses, they have announced this and people can drop-in and have them. I have been getting my information about the vaccine via the television news, from social media, from word of mouth and from the council and government websites. I think there has been some confusion about the administration of the second vaccine â€“ around the time gap that should be left between the first and second â€“ but otherwise I think it has been pretty clear and certainly in our area there are lots of opportunities, advertised on street billboards, to go and have a vaccine either with or without an appointment. Making Vaccines Mandatory My understanding is that some diseases are already 'banned' from some countries â€“ yellow fever, for instance â€“ and people can be refused travel if they have these diseases. I can completely understand that Cyprus and other countries may wish to require vaccination â€“ or at the very least a negative COVID-19 test â€“ before travel. There needs to be a way, however, for those unable to have the vaccine to still be able to travel. I am not keen on the idea of vaccine passports for pubs etc. as I think there is a huge risk that some communities who have been resistant to taking the vaccine for various reasons will be marginalised. Although I tend to think that while it might seem like a good idea and I would feel safer in a place where everyone was vaccinated, that it has terrible implications which are unsettling and troubling and therefore require a lot of thought before enacting. I read that vaccinations are going to be mandatory for care home workers â€“ I can understand that more as they are working with such vulnerable people, although it would be preferable to try and persuade and reassure people about the vaccine first, before forcing them by law."

I went from getting up, eating breakfast, leaving for work at 7.30am, coming home at about 6pm to spending the entire time at home in my tiny flat. Protecting the vulnerable person I live with meant that I stuck quite rigidly to the Government guidance at the time, and during those three months I would get up at 6am and go out for an hour’s walk around the relatively deserted streets and parks. By 7am it became too busy with joggers to feel safe so I returned home and stayed in. Six days of the week were then taken up with work and studying with one day, Saturday, allocated as a rest day (and housework day). I had mixed feelings about this situation. In many ways I felt trapped, and caught in a static moment where nothing was changing and each day was a repetition of the others. Equally, I felt a great sense of relief as many of life’s pressures were forcibly removed (I realise this was not the case for many, many people).  Looking back at the lockdown three months I see them as a distinct moment in time in the phases of the pandemic. The early rising and inside living became unsustainable and unhealthy so, once lockdown was over, I moderated my daily patterns, but I miss the early morning walks of that first part of the pandemic. Duing those walks, cars, buses, and people were rare and I saw animals and birds in the streets of Hackney, including some ducks at one point on the pavement (I think they had come from the Woodberry Wetlands). I loved standing on the hill in Springfield Park in Clapton and looking out over the city and then crossing the River Lea into the Walthamstow Marshes and seeing so much unpeopled space. I felt extremely well and vibrant at those moments.  Since early July and the easing of lockdown I have added more activities to my life and each new one marks a new stage. I am still being more cautious than many people I know, again due to my caring responsibilities. In July I started going out for more than one walk a day and varying the times I went outside. I was terrified to begin with but increasingly felt OK about walking near people again, although I wear a mask most of the time. I have two friends who live locally that I have met in the park, for walks, and even in a pub garden. I have managed to get on an overground train three times so far: once to visit my family, once to go to a crematorium memorial and once to go for an outdoors, socially distanced dance lesson. Each time I do this I feel pleased with myself but also anxious and put all my clothes in the wash as soon as I get in the front door and feel like I need to scour my skin clean lest I bring infection into the home         Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian K7066 Homelife This has been one of the trickiest aspects of the pandemic to manage. Our flat is so tiny and I don’t have a desk or comfy working chair so working from home has been problematic to say the least. I am also constantly aware that everything I do working from home impacts on my partner whose day has also changed because I am there all the time. His ill health has meant he is at home during the day, and has been for at least the last 5 years. I am getting used to working while listening to Round the Horne or whatever else he is listening to or watching and he is getting used to hearing me run online research skills sessions for students. There is no way around us hearing what the other is doing or listening to all the time. Where I sit, in the kitchen, also blocks access to the sink, cooker and kettle so there is a really cluttered, obstructive feel to working from home. I do, however, ensure that I only work during my normal work hours. I shut my computer at the end of my paid hours and that is that. I then tend to go for a walk before I come home, cook tea, and the evening begins. I have always been quite strict about the distinction between home and work, and never worked unpaid overtime even before the pandemic, and have ensured I don’t get into what I consider bad habits now that I am at home all the time.  Media and Technology Since the last directive it has been confirmed at my workplace, in a university library, that the rapid digital changes we have undergone since March are not only here to stay but likely to increase further. My working and student life now contains virtual training, virtual meetings, ordering and reading e-books and e-journals and learning how to present my ideas and thoughts in new and varied ways using new (to me) IT systems and software. In my personal life, however, my use of digital vs analogue has stayed the same. I have read during this period a large number of print novels and other books, ordered and read and enjoyed a huge pile of small press zines and magazines, and during the lockdown period I kept an ever-changing paper list of all the food and other items that we needed in the flat. In that way I kept on top of what we had and what we needed to order via Asda. I amended the list using a pen, and a five-bar-gate system. I still have the main list although I now can access food more easily so no longer use it. I will probably keep it as a memento of these horrible times – and for another lockdown, if that should happen. Waiting Life does seem to be ‘on hold’, and quite stuck. It is harder as the pandemic goes on to feel that an end is in sight. In some ways, habits and activities have continued as before: I still work, I am still a student, I have completed projects in both these areas. Small improvements have happened: I have seen my family once, a couple of  K7066      Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian friends a couple of times, and been able to go out at varying times of day. Overall, however, the time has been one of some sadness. People I know have lost their jobs, others are working in at-risk industries, and nobody really knows when or if these situations will improve. A neighbour and friend died during the pandemic, of cancer, and I was unable to attend her funeral. This inability to move beyond certain bounds, caused by risk to health or government rulings, has meant so much of life is trapped within a small space physically, mentally and emotionally.  During the March – June lockdown, although life was stuck, it was an enforced situation in which the whole country was enmeshed. The situation since July, whereby the country has differing rules across its regions and there is more confusion about what can and can’t be done, has made the waiting seem more chaotic and frightening. My depression, which I had kept under control in the early part of the pandemic, has been getting worse and has been pretty bad recently. This has led to a lot more waiting on my part as I have been unable to do all I need to do, including responding quickly to this directive. It is also why my responses are quite mundane and perhaps less detailed then I might have liked, as I am still struggling to do what I need to do at the moment."

If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine  Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I work for the NHS so got it from the hospital where I work. The atmosphere was organised, complicated but efficient. I drove to and from the hospital. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Pfizer How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? I felt awful for about 5 days. For the first 3 days I had to go to bed with fever, muscle aches and headache. After the second dose I felt poorly for about 3 days but not as bad as after the first dose. C7557 Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? Yes I am following restrictions. I agree with the government unlocking process so far apart from the travel restrictions which I believe should be as strict as those in Australia and New Zealand with mandatory hotel quarantine. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? Yes because no one knows the long terms effects of the vaccine â€“ itâ€™s all unknown. I had the vaccine as itâ€™s the lesser of two evils but the scientists donâ€™t know the long term effects so there are risks for the future. If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine Will you accept an invitation to book the vaccine when it is offered to you? Please share your motivations for your decision.  Are you hoping to receive a particular vaccine? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Will you follow the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19? (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc) as more people receive the vaccine. What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). . Priority groups, GP surgeries are doing a great job and are underutilised in general so its important they are playing a key role. Where do you get your information about the vaccine?

Channel 4 news, BBC podcasts, government advice provide me with reliable information about the vaccine. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs.

I have been mostly confined to the house since 23rd March, when I was placed on furlough from work. I have asthma and so have taken all the necessary precautions, such as hand washing, using anti-bacterial hand gel, keeping a two metre gap between myself and other people, and so on. Occasionally I wear latex gloves and a mask in shops, but I find that I touch my face more when wearing a mask. I feel that I'm doing all I can to avoid infection and infecting others. I had to go to the doctor's for my B12 injection this week. I have them every three months and I wasn't sure that the GP's surgery would be open, but I got an appointment straight away. The nurse said that they are trying to keep such services going, rather than having a huge surge of patients when lockdown is lifted. I was requested to wear a face mask if I had one and the nurse was also wearing one. My teenage daughter is finding lockdown far more difficult than I am. She really misses her friends. I'm quite introverted and not very sociable and so it is actually improving my mental health to be at home. I feel far more relaxed and less anxious. I occasionally feel overwhelmed by news from the outside world and so I don't dwell on it. The Government I think that the government response to the Covid-19 has been negligent. Weeks before lockdown, we did risk assessments at work and introduced cleaning routines and precautions: this is without being told to by the government. While the Prime Minister was still telling us that washing our hands was enough to stop the spread; that he had been shaking hands with hospital patients and that we were to 'take it on the chin,' people started taking precautions themselves. I know someone whose family live in Slovakia and they acted far more quickly -they took it very seriously as early as February and have had fewer cases as a result. The government response was late and badly managed. There was no quarantine procedure and people weren't being checked as they arrived at airports from abroad. When I flew to Hong Kong during the 1990s, during an outbreak of bird flu, everyone had their temperature taken as they disembarked the plane. This should have been introduced here as soon as we became aware of Covid-19 in Wuhan. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells In February, my daughter's classmate came back from a skiing trip in Italy with flu-like symptoms and a cough. She wasn't quarantined and it spread all round the class. I'm sure this happened up and down the country, as people returned from skiing holidays in France, Austria and Italy, where there were known outbreaks of Covid-19. The current government message to be 'alert' is confusing and meaningless. How can you be alert to an invisible virus? There are confusing and contradictory messages coming from the Government and the media is also making things much worse by scaremongering and causing panic. It is a time when strong leadership is needed, but we don't have it. News I watched the first Prime Ministerial address to the nation on 23rd March and I watched his recent address about the loosening of lockdown. I don't watch the daily briefings. I read newspapers online; mostly The Guardian, but other newspapers too, if they're not behind a paywall. I buy a Weekend Guardian on Saturday. I keep track of news on Twitter, but I notice that they are less up-to-date now -there was a time when Twitter had lots of breaking news, but it seems less on top of things now. I don't have a television and don't watch TV news. I don't think 24 hour rolling news is good for my mental health and I have taken the deliberate decision not to fixate on the news. I have seen the panic caused by the media, for example the early stockpiling which lead to food shortages in March. The tabloids should be more circumspect, rather than using shock tactics for clickbait. With regards to the BSL campaign -of course, it is vital that sign language is available. No one should be excluded from receiving important news updates. Work and Home Life The last day I went to work was 23rd March 2020. It was quite stressful, as we were cleaning our office three times a day and our boss had developed a cough and was working from home. There were lots of rumours about lockdown and it was making people anxious. I wasn't sure about my financial situation and was worried about that. When I got home from work, I had an email from the Directors at work, saying that I had been placed on Furlough. My line manager phoned later that day, to see if I had any questions. You aren't legally allowed to work on the Furlough scheme, so I haven't been to work since. It isn't possible for me to work from home -my work involves huge amounts of paperwork and it isn't digitised. We have physical invoices and delivery notes to process. I think that it shows that my company needs to update procedures and modernise, as Covid­19 may never go away and working from home may become a necessity. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells My fifteen-year-old daughter has school work to do on the computer. Fortunately her school provided her with a laptop earlier in the year, through a bursary for under-privileged children. She finds it very difficult to motivate herself at home and some days I know she isn't doing anything, although she pretends that she is! I have spoken to school and they are sympathetic, they understand that it is a huge thing to adjust to. I have concentrated on making art, while I'm stuck in the house. I try to draw, paint or collage every day. I haven't been able to read much, so I can sympathise with my daughter -there's something about lockdown which makes it difficult to concentrate. I find my mind wanders too much. It's as though we are waiting for something to happen. Some days we don't go for our daily exercise, although I know we should. My daughter finds 'social distancing' stressful and there are always people in the park. I have been interested to discover how much commerce motivates me to leave the house -normally I would go for a walk around the shops, but I can't do that now. The park is lovely, but it gets boring going there day after day. Technology I check my phone occasionally, but I'm not that bothered about technology. I like Instagram, mildly dislike Twitter and loathe Facebook. I'm very old fashioned and even before lockdown I had lots of pen pals, so I actually write letters more than I text or email people. I wouldn't dream of FaceTiming someone -I think it's awful. For my daughter, on the other hand, technology has been a lifeline. She had her fifteenth birthday in lockdown and she and her friends did a big Zoom party. Recently she organised a 90s rave via Facetime for her friend's birthday -they dressed up and danced, while talking to each other on their phones. She also had a Biology tutorial via video conference, with her teacher and some classmates. Shopping A couple of weeks before lockdown I managed to organise an online shop and bought extra tinned food, loo rolls and a 3kg bag of pasta. I have no money, so it wasn't exactly stockpiling. Since then, I haven't been able to get a delivery slot. They are booked up weeks ahead. I don't drive, so I had always got my shopping delivered, but I understand that the elderly and those who are 'shielding' need it more. My ex-husband's wife is very kind and asks if I need anything when she goes to Sainsburys. I go to M&S, perhaps once a week. It is more expensive, but it's far less stressful -it's so organised and clean and everyone is good at social distancing. There are now empty fridges in store, but I'm not sure if this is a supply chain problem or a response to fewer customers. I have also started getting a veg box delivered -this is through a wholesaler who has needed to diversify due to restaurant closures. I am happy to support a local business in this difficult time. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells Entertainment and Leisure I have loved having all this free time for my hobbies, but I'm not doing the things that I imagined I would at the start of lockdown. As I'm an avid reader and write short stories, I thought that I would be reading lots of books and writing more. However, apart from my daily diary, I haven't felt any desire to write at all. I also can't concentrate on reading and have read fewer books than I would normally. I have finished reading: Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World, by Laura Spinney Empty World, by John Christopher A Bit of a Stretch -The Diaries of a Prisoner, by Chris Atkins The Wall Jumper, by Peter Schneider The Children of Men, by P D James Mostly I have been making art. I have been carving rubber stamps, drawing, painting and making collages. I have also tried drawing with inks, which I enjoy. Painting is a new medium for me and I'm not very confident or skilful at it. I have enjoyed watching Grayson Perry's Art Club on Channel 4 for inspiration. My daughter enjoys watching TV with me at the end of the day, but, as I said, we don't watch terrestrial television. We watch Task Master on UKTV Play before bed, as it makes us laugh -I feel it's important to go to sleep feeling happy and not worried. We occasionally watch Rick and Morty, The Mighty Boosh and Toast on Netflix, but we have exhausted them from repeat viewing. As they are doing a 30-day free trial, we subscribed to Britbox UK and I have been watching Shetland on my own and Nathan Barley and Broadchurch with my daughter. I have also tried to introduce my daughter to some classic films on DVD. We have watched Black Narcissus together, plus some Lotte Reineger animations and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1970s version). We watched the latest version of Emma on Amazon Prime as a birthday treat for my daughter. I wish I had felt motivated to exercise more during lockdown, but I have low level anxiety about going outside. Unfortunately, we don't have a proper garden you could sit in. We have mostly stayed indoors. Personal Hygiene I guess it's different when you know that no one is going come within sniffing distance of you, so I would say that I am less bothered about showering every day. I would never go to work without having a shower first, but sometimes I will skip a day now. Never more than this -I would feel disgusting if I didn't wash my hair for a few days. G7105 Female 49 years old Divorced Invoice Clerk Tunbridge Wells I have noticed a meme on social media about women not shaving their legs on lockdown. have shaved my legs only twice on lockdown, but that is mainly because I'm avoiding non­essential shopping and haven't been anywhere to buy razors. I really, really miss buying nice bath bombs and cosmetics as a treat. Lush will be one of the first shops I go to when they reopen. I've been brushing my teeth more diligently, as the dentists are all shut and I don't want any dental problems. I have a semi-erupted wisdom tooth which sometimes gets infected and I want to avoid this very painful experience on lockdown. Sleep I have had some periods of insomnia, but no more than usual. I sleep badly any way. I get very hot at night and sleep with the window open, so any sound in the street will disturb me. I never remember dreams, but I had a really funny one at the beginning of lockdown. I dreamed that I went on a blind date with the Health Minister, Matt Hancock. He was a good dancer. I have no attraction to him in real life -it was definitely not an erotic dream! My sleep pattern is more like a weekend than a working day now. I usually get up for work at 6.30am. I find that I'm waking up around then, without setting an alarm, but having a lie-in for an hour or two. This is what I would normally do on Saturday and Sunday. In conclusion I have enjoyed being home and it has made me appreciate ordinary things more. I was feeling sick of Tunbridge Wells before lockdown, but now I really appreciate living in such a safe and picturesque town.  There is a lot of community spirit in the town and people have set up Facebook groups to support the vulnerable. On a personal level, it has made me appreciate my relationship with my daughter, but has also made me realise how much happier I would be if I had a creative job. While my experience is so far positive, I know that there are people struggling and suffering at the moment and I look forward to a return to normality for everyone’s sake."

Spring Directive 2021 Part 3: The COVID-19 Vaccine When the first COVID-19 submission reached us in March 2020, it felt as if a vaccine was a long way off and â€˜lockdownâ€™ was the new normal. However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I was in the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable category following cancer treatment in 2020 so was invited to go for a vaccination by my GP surgery.  The text came on a Tuesday offering me to choose an appointment the next day or on the Saturday.  I chose the Saturday at 3.50pm.  The vaccinations were being given at the local football club -a 45 minute walk from where I live and somewhere I had not been before so I left early and walked quickly and arrived in good time.  The centre was well staffed and very organised with only a few people queueing to get in, name checked, hands sanitised and move forward onto a marker keeping us all 6 feet apart.  The nurse who gave my injection was a Mum from the school where I work so that was nice and we had a quick chat whilst she was checking my details and giving the injection. Similar when I had my second jab and I met another nurse who I know and had a quick chat with her. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Astra Zeneca How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? I felt fine after the injection and was not aware of any side effects. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? I do socially distance when I am out and about and interacting with strangers, but not in an obsessive way â€“ more like a being polite way.  I do wear a mask when in shops or on the M6726 train. I have met friends for a walk and sat on park benches with them whilst drinking a cup of take away coffee.  I asked to be taken off the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable list as my chemotherapy treatment finished in August and in a normal world I would have returned to work in November.  I was set to return mid November , but we went into tier 4 and I received a letter from Matt Hancock telling me to stay home, then we had the December lockdown and then finally the 2021 lockdown. After my first vaccination I asked the GP to take me off the list so that I could return to work as I felt I was no longer at greater risk than anyone else my age and felt rather cheeky that I was not working.  I returned to work 8th March when the children who had not been as school since Christmas returned.  I wear a mask as I move around the school building.  When I am in the classrooms it varies.  If I am delivering my lesson I remove my mask so that the children can understand what I am saying. If I move around the room and am nearer to the children then I put my mask back on. I think the government have a difficult job balancing restrictions and peopleâ€™s health.  I think they did not act quickly enough last year to put us into lockdown or to introduce mask wearing.  I think they are now finally being cautious and being more sensible about the planned timetable to remove restrictions. However â€“ pub gardens open until late at night does not seem very sensible to me. If they waited another month until people were indoors then it would be easier for the customers to be supervised and kept at a more suitable distance. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? No,  the side effects of the vaccine are less than the many side effects that were possible with the cancer treatment I have had last year and the possibility of being ill with COVID seems worse and more likely to happen if I do not have the vaccine. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, plans to vaccinate key workers). Most of my friends went online to book a vaccination slot and they went to a nearby newly built empty school building to have their jabs.  Everyone I know has been impressed with the organisation and how well supervised the centre is. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.  I mainly follow the news on my BBC news app on my I phone.  I also listen to the 1 oclock news on Radio 4.  They seem to talk about COVID all the time! Sometimes I think people are just trying to fill the news programme and they donâ€™t really have much to say so fill in the time with tosh. M6726 No vaccination is 100% efficient.  Some people will have side effects.  Life has side effects. Lots of people have died or have been very ill with COVID and if taking the vaccine helps reduce the chance of death or Long COVID then I think it is worth taking. If new variants are immune to the vaccinations we have at the moment then I am sure scientists will work on improving them to help in the future.  It is amazing and remarkable and impressive that within a year several different companies have managed to get vaccinations manufactured and distributed. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. I think the â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ is a difficult decision and could make life very hard for some people. It might be that some people are not able to have the vaccination because of complicated health reasons, I understand that some people refuse to have injections on religious grounds or because they are phobic.  If people are only vaccinated once they reach a certain age, what happens if a family want to travel or visit somewhere and not all are vaccinated.  What happens if you live in a country where they are slower with the vaccinations? This is a really tricky question and it would be wrong to penalise people who have not been vaccinated. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? I donâ€™t know if you are thinking of any specific ones or if it is a vague general comment.  So I will say I donâ€™t think any should be made mandatory without good reason.  When you travel to different countries they usually advise you to have vaccinations but I am not sure whether any of those are compulsory rather than just suggestions for your own safety.

Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covid19 (Update) I am writing this on Monday 18th May. Health In January 2020 I underwent breast cancer surgery and was waiting for chemotherapy to start. As the Covid situation worsened my husband was very concerned about me starting chemotherapy and wanted me to delay it until the virus passed. The consultant and I wanted to start the chemotherapy. The date for my first treatment was set for Tuesday 17th March. On the previous Sunday evening (15th) our son (B, 21) phoned to ask if he could come home from university as he was worried about a flatmate that was ill and generally concerned about the virus. We suggested he contact his tutors and decide definitely the next weekend. On Monday 16th he sent a message to say he was coming home on Tuesday 17th. On the same day (16th) our daughter (H, 24) who was working in Banff, Canada was asked to let her employers know on Weds 18th whether she intended to stay in Canada or leave as the ski resorts had shut and bars, pubs, nightclubs were shutting. She decided to come home and arrived on March 25th – my birthday and quarantined in her room for 2 weeks before joining in with family activities. Lockdown started here Monday 23rd March. I had my chemo treatment as planned and took myself for a little walk most days away from town centre keeping a good distance from other people. We are lucky that we live on a lane at the edge of town near some fields/park, so it is relatively easy to maintain social distancing. My husband and I do not own a car and after speaking to the GP decided it was preferable to ask friends for a lift to hospital appointments. Previously I had taken a bus and was prepared to take a taxi home if I did not feel well, but the GP thought it better to go with a friend – preferably one who was also shielding. After a few weeks I received a letter from the government/NHS stating that I am classed as clinically extremely vulnerable advising me to stay indoors for 12 weeks and even shield from my family members if possible. Given that I travel in a car with someone every 3 weeks and spend time in a room with other patients/medical staff and have to go for blood tests every 3 weeks, I meet a lot of people already so staying indoors the rest of the time seemed a bit pointless. I continue to go for a short walk most days. Sometimes I have a met a friend for a chat at the garden gate or in the park. My husband, daughter and son go shopping so I do not go into confined spaces with lots of people. Lockdown was slightly lifted last week (11th May) and my son asked permission to meet a friend of his in the park and my daughter asked if she could meet a friend over the weekend. They both assured us that they would comply with social distancing. How kind – I meet many more people than they do. My physical issues are being superbly dealt with by the hospital and GP surgery which has instigated a special blood test surgery with appointments every 15 minutes and a one way system through the building. Most of my appointments with the consultant have moved to be a telephone call every 3 weeks rather than in person. At the day unit where I receive chemotherapy the number of patients has been reduced and the chairs are further apart. I think the care has been very good. Mentally I am having the best of times. My children have come home. They have brought companionship, fun, noise, distraction, lots of laundry and mess. If just my husband and I were stuck at home alone with chemotherapy and the virus it would be much more boring and harder to cope with. We have diversions and distractions. If I had had cancer 10 years ago I would be running the house – shopping, cooking, cleaning, supervising school work. If I had cancer 10 years in the future I would be older and the children might be settled in a different town with partners and maybe their own children. At this time I have chemotherapy treatment and sometimes feel a bit unwell and I do not have to do to anything as they are quite capable of looking after themselves. They also report that they feel quite settled in the lockdown and do not regret coming home. We are all able to keep in touch with friends through whatsapp and zoom, we have a garden and live in a rural part of town. I understand that we are very lucky and that other people in different situations may not be finding it so easy. Emotionally I feel relaxed and content in the current situation. I work in a primary school and the government wants schools to take more pupils back from 1st June – they are already open for the children of key workers. I am glad that I am off work and not having to think about organising activities for young children that incorporate social distancing. I am worried that my children’s future is uncertain. Will my son return to Nottingham for university lessons or will they be online? Will he have to pay rent for a room he is not using? How will he collect the things that are still sitting in his room in Nottingham? My daughter planned to move to Bristol in August with a friend, get a job and study for a part time MSc. What will her chances be of getting a job – even a low paid hospitality/retail job. She would like to learn to drive but driving schools are not yet up and running. Will she be able to get a job working for an environmental charity when those jobs are already few and far between? The Government Initially I thought the government responded quite well offering the furlough scheme to workers laid off. I think maybe they should have locked down earlier – you could see that all the other European countries were locking down and the deaths were alarming in Spain France and Italy even in March. They are in an impossible situation – having to respond to something they did not have a plan for. Each decision seems to be taken as a reaction to something that has happened rather than taken as an overall strategy. They are asking people to go back to work, but not to use public transport, so the roads are becoming congested and air pollution will rise again. In London they are going to increase bike lanes. It would have been more sensible to have built the bike lanes before asking people to drive to work. News We do not watch the news on TV. We rarely buy a newspaper. My husband likes to listen to Radio4 news at 1o’clock. I have the BBC News app on my phone which I only recently installed. I read about the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm on the app. I receive enough information without it being too detailed. Work and home life As I mentioned above I usually work in a primary school but am off work because of my chemotherapy treatments. My husband works as a therapist so is seeing patients through Skype rather than face to face. My son usually works part time in a coffee shop but has been furloughed. My daughter does not have a job as she recently returned from Canada and has not been in a position to look for a new job. Home life is great as we are all together with no immediate worries. As the lockdown lifts and the children start to move back out into the real world then their career prospects might become more of a worry for them. At the moment we are living in a bubble. Technology I already knew how to Whatsapp video call people and have been using that to contact a few friends. A couple of other friends I phone without the visual element. My book group used Houseparty for one meeting and then used Zoom for the next one. We will stick with Zoom from now on as it seem more successful to use. I have not increased my use of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram much over this time. Shopping and food My husband, son and daughter take it in turns to go to Waitrose to get the shopping and carry it home. We can only buy what we can carry because we do not have a car. We have fruit and veg deliveredweekly througha box scheme anyway. We usually have toilet paper and tissues delivered from What the Crap company so the panic buying of those items has not been a problem for us. The local independent supermarket has started to do online deliveries so that has been useful. Obviously we need a lot more food now that the children have come home, but they have shared the burden of the shopping. My husband buys organic wholesome items. My son buys cake, biscuits, chocolate and sweets, oven chips and chicken nuggets. My daughter buys a sensible cross section of items. So the day my son goes shopping is always the more exciting. I am definitely putting on weight as I eat my way through the biscuits/cakes/desserts. This is partly because I am trying to find ways to counteract the horrible taste left by chemotherapy and partly because I do like chocolate and I am not walking distances anything like I usually do. Entertainment and Leisure I start my day reading a factual book whilst eating breakfast. After I am dressed I spend a bit of time working on a jigsaw puzzle – a new lockdown pastime. I always practise piano in the day. I have completed 2 courses from Future Learn – A History of Royal Fashion and Jane Austen: Myth, Reality and Global Celebrity. I have done some of these before. I started to work through a Latin course in March but have not done so much on that lately. I edit the magazine for the local U3A group and that has taken up more time recently as the next edition is about to be published. I knit for a charity Knit for Peace and have recently finished a jumper for a 10 year old boy and have just started something similar for a girl. I enjoy reading and have recently downloaded 50 classic stories onto my kindle so that I always have something available to read. My daughter and I have been watching Grayson Perry Art club TV programme so have been inspired to get arty. (A new pastime). I have bought some watercolour paints, pens and quality art paper. I have also ordered some mosaic pieces as we plan to decorate mirrors in the next few weeks. My son and husband have been inspired to join in a bit as well. As a family we have been playing board games some evenings. I do not watch that much TV especially at the moment. My son wants to use the playstation attached to the TV to play games with his friends in the evening and I think it is more important for him to have some social interaction than for me to watch TV. My husband, daughter and I are watching The Nest – rather creepy series about a couple who have asked a young woman to have a surrogate baby for them. My daughter and I watched Hidden Figures film recently about African American women working for NASA. We also watched a chick flit film with Rebel Wilson. Personal hygiene I have the same number of showers/baths per week but I no longer wash my hair as so much has fallen out due to chemotherapy that I do not want to wash away the last remaining strands! I wear the same clothes for 2 or even 3 days now to reduce washing and since I rarely see anyone no one will know. I do so little exercise that I don’t believe I am sweaty or smelly. Sleep I sleep just fine thank you possibly because the chemotherapy makes me very tired, possibly because I am quite relaxed. I think the rest of the family are also sleeping as usually. My daughter and son have had vivid dreams in the past and occasionally have some now. I heard my daughter call out in her sleep just last night and apparently she dreamt someone was in her room. She can be quite noisy when sleeping."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Neither my partner nor myself have been unwell over the last ten weeks. Bad hay fever this year might have caused us on occasion to think that we had covid 19 symptoms but you just have to try and stay calm and ask whether this is really any different to normal. The changing advice on symptoms also makes it difficult to know quite what to look out for. For instance, in the last couple of weeks there has been reference to loss of taste – with blocked sinuses from hay fever poor sense of taste is also something I’ve experienced. I think ultimately as an asthmatic I tend to know when I don’t feel quite right, so I have to think that this judgement is sufficient even at the moment. I think at the start we were particularly on the lookout for a high temperature and unusual headache. I would say there was a heightened anxiety for both of us at the start of the “lockdown” period and also leading up to the imposed restrictions, not concerning ourselves but primarily about how we would be able to support both sets of elderly parents, late 80’s, at a distance of 70 miles. Whilst this is still a constant concern, a pattern of ordering food, keeping contact etc has now been established. Initially though these concerns are what caused the greatest anxiety for us both resulting in fatigue, poor sleep, strange dreams and short tempers! I suffer from migraine which ordinarily would have been better controlled with an imposed routine with regular meals, hours and not going far from home, but I experienced a cluster of migraines which it was difficult to shift especially as my sleep was so disrupted. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I’ve had no need to access health care, but I was due to attend a hospital appointment for post surgery physio. This took place over the phone and I was then sent videos of exercises. Because I’d previously had appointments and have seen significant improvement in strength and movement, this was more than acceptable, but I think I would have felt differently earlier in the process where it was critical for a physical examination to assess my needs. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I would say that my emotions feel quite “normal” for me now. At the start of the shutdown though I felt more unsettled. Listening to news items on the radio could cause me to become tearful. Now I feel that my response is of being deeply moved, and then angry that so much of what has gone wrong could have been prevented, for instance if the health service had not been cut to the bare bones. Ordinarily I’m involved in local politics and we would have been out campaigning for the now postponed London GLA and mayoral elections. I’m frustrated that at a local level we don’t have a way of challenging the nationally defined and politically charged messages. Locally there has been a campaign to save out local hospital, and I wonder whether the clap for carers will be transformed into the local electorate realising they have to fight to maintain our service. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? The government continues to say it is guided by the science, but this is meaningless and nonsense. On the face of it, the decisions made appear to contradict the ideology of the current government, especially the economic decisions. Ultimately though the government had to induce a recession to ensure that thee was so little activity that people, if not technically in total lockdown(as was experienced in Italy for instance) believed that they were, in order to curtail people’s activities and thus prevent the infection getting out of control. In the last week the government is now trying to kickstart the economy again. Some people seem willing to go along with this -some because they have no choice to maintain their livelihood, others because they just want to go out. I fear that some think that because they’ve stayed at home that they won’t catch the virus now, and so their resolve to continue social distance has diminished, so potentially the decision to ease lockdown could result in another spike. Perhaps this is deliberate, as politicians such as Iain Duncan Smith show their callousness and brutality when interviewed. He is categorical that there is no choice but to return to work, and he seems to suggest this regardless of the consequent number of lives lost. One decision that was clearly politically motivated was that relating to the funding of Transport for London(Tfl). Numbers using the tube have dropped by (?) 90%, so successful with regard to social distancing and ensuring that key workers can get to work safely, however the resulting loss in revenue has meant that the Labour London Mayor had to seek a £1.6 billion bailout package and the associated conditions will be politically damaging(the mayoral and GLA elections have been postponed a year to May 2021). He will be required to put restrictions on free travel for the over 60’s, increase fares and possibly remove free travel for children. Transport is one of a few areas where the mayor can make decisions for London and this has been taken away from him in a politically way as other European cities have subsidised public transport. A major scandal has been the way in which the government has shown a disregard for the lives of the elderly and the vulnerable. Even before there were any restrictions on daily activity, the public was told that Covid 19 was like a seasonal flu and that anyway it was only the elderly and those with underlying health conditions at risk. The message was that these lives were dispensable and many who fall into these categories were given the implicit message that valuable ventilators would not be used to attempt to save their lives. These groups have been left in a no win situation – those in care homes are still struggling to obtain tests, as are staff, and whilst residents were starting to die in outbreaks in homes, the government continued to say that there wasn’t a problem. People were discharged from hospital to care homes without being tested and consequently were still covid positive and returned still capable of transmitting the virus. The lack of availability of suitable personal protective equipment(PPE) continues, showing scant regard for the lives of workers. Care homes have had to pay inflated prices as the government does not supply them directly. Carers have been unable to get tested, with many so worried about residents and their own families that they have moved into the care homes. There is now evidence that those of BME heritage are at increased risk from the virus and despite this being evident in the disproportionate number of deaths of non-white health and care workers, the government merely announces this as a “risk factor”, with no suggestion as to how BME workers will be protected. Increasingly statistics are rolled out and statements made which fail to show even a pretence of compassion. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Despite what is currently being said, I think that there is likely to be a return to some form of “austerity”. Although it makes no economic sense to think that the debt which is building from, for instance furlough payments, should be paid off, particularly as current low interest rates mean that servicing the debt is low, the Tories will struggle to stop themselves saying that the country can’t afford it. It’s likely that labour laws will be relaxed further and the rights of workers further eroded; possibly the minimum wage will be frozen. However there is a distinct possibility of an L-shaped recession, so if the economy is going to do more than bounce along the floor, the government will have to make decisions about how they can increase aggregate demand. Politically it would be damaging to increase direct taxes for those already in the upper income tax bracket, but if they choose to increase regressive indirect taxes then inequality will worsen. To limit benefits for the unemployed and the low paid will deepen and prolong the recession, but unfortunately I don’t trust this government not to do this. They might consider a hypothecated tax, from income tax or more likely national insurance, but in reality any of these measures will merely give the illusion that they are attempting to “bring the deficit down”. There have been numerous comparisons with the 2008 crash. This morning I heard George Osborne interviewed and he made statements such as “the country will be poorer” suggesting that we are yet again being prepared for significant public sector service cuts, benefit freezes and stricter eligibility criteria for benefits, as the government will want to quickly withdraw from the government ownership, payment of wages and nationalisation that has taken place. They will argue that state control will stifle enterprise, that the country can’s afford the debt etc etc. The sectors now centrally organised will be returned to the private sector in the guise of dealing with the debt, when in reality hedge funds and financiers will be given the chance to purchase equity at significantly reduced prices. Unfortunately, rather than saying this is a global downturn, the government will go out of its way to hold its ideological ground and “bribe” (for instance with further deregulation of the labour market) those already with wealth and resources at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly. The project to conclude the privatisation of the NHS will be hastened, as we are told that it is unsustainable to run at a “loss” a hospital/GP practice/community services/ social care etc. The Thursday “clap” for carers is a useful distraction to mark the passing of another week and stops serious questioning about the underfunding and privatisation of the service which has resulted in health, care and other workers dying because they went to work and were not given the correct equipment, facilities or testing which might have saved their lives. This week the government, after much pressure from its own back benchers, to allow those workers in health and care who are defined as “migrants”, to access health care without paying the surcharge. Not only have the logistics yet to be arranged, but the surcharge is to be increased to over £600 a month in October, and sadly I suspect those workers will then be told they have to pay the charge yet again. Footnote: this weekend the story has broken about Dominic Cummings breaking the lockdown in April to travel with his family from London to his parental home in Durham. With announcements due this week about possible relaxation in rules the media and government have become preoccupied with this story. My main concern is how this will now affect guidelines in the coming weeks. People are angry, upset and showing a loss of confidence in the “leadership”, and there’s much talk of “one rule for us, and one for them”. Generally people will comply with restrictions on their lives if they perceive they are not being singled out and victimised, and this story completely destroys this tenuous bond of trust. A sense of equity has been, and is, pivotal to such a high adherence to the “lockdown” measures News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I tend to listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 for a couple of hours from its start at 6am to catch up on any developments from the previous day and for international news especially anything that has broken in the US. I briefly read the Guardian online, but not every morning and then the next regular source is the Channel 4 news in the evening. Occasionally I’ll catch the 10 o’clock news and/or Newsnight, but won’t stick with either it feels like mere repetition, or just too much of a platform for the government’s message. I made the decision very early not to keep track of rolling news as it could have been too overwhelming. I’m also concerned about being led to believe something because it fits with the message of the day, particularly by the use of photos, so I prefer to let the news “mature” and allow myself time to reflect. I’m aware that this is at odds with rolling news and constant drip feeds and chitter chatter from social media. I’m especially impressed by the reports that Victoria Mcdonald presents on Channel 4. I will sometimes dip into twitter to see but I don’t tweet. I have no alerts on my phone so am not constantly scrolling. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I watched them in the first week, and now sometimes dip into a live audio broadcast. If there is a specific set of policies that are to be announced then I’m more likely to listen, specifically if the chancellor is speaking. On the whole they appear to be a front for the message of the day, and by having a member of the cabinet standing between “2 scientists” there’s an attempt at creating an (unconvincing) illusion of science guided policy which is beyond politics. The broadcasts have become less palatable to watch as it is so clear when the front politician is lying. So many mistakes have been made and so many deadlines missed that it is astounding that they continue to sound so emphatic. Questions are on the whole inadequately answered and when pushed if something will take place(for instance testing in care homes) the words used are carefully chosen – “an aspiration” or “tests are available” Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? This has not touched me personally, but I remember mentioning to my partner that in one news bulletin Bolsanaro had someone signing, and wondering why the UK government didn’t especially as the Welsh and Scottish briefings do have interpreters. The response from the UK government a couple of weeks ago was that they were looking into this(what was there to look into?) but nothing has changed, which is unacceptable and says something truly disturbing and yet unsurprising about the attitude of those in charge. Accessibility is still seen a luxury which is an insult to all those affected. The lack of BSL signers is unfortunately just one example of the problems many are experiencing– ASD, those with mental health issues, those with learning difficulties, the visually impaired, elderly carers and so on. Information was also not circulated in braille, and I know from local media that a couple who are visually impaired didn’t know what they should do as they had not seen the government’s advice, and consequently one of them died as he didn’t get to hospital on time. The elderly mother of a friend has had some problems specifically at the start. She is severely visually impaired, lives on her own, and is in her 90’s. He has been arranging Sainsbury’s deliveries for her for several years mow but he was suddenly unable to do so as she isn’t considered vulnerable according to government criteria. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I’m not in paid employment so I’ve no immediate direct personal experience of this. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My partner and I are very fortunate as neither of us is in paid employment and we have no school aged children. We are fortunate to have a garden and 2 separate downstairs rooms so we are able to escape from eachother if we need to! Pre pandemic we chose to spend our days together so we haven’t been forced into an unfamiliar situation. We have many shared interests and with the benefit of the internet it’s possible to pursue these ad infinitum. Having said that, we are also both self sufficient and equally happy to spend time apart even if the distance is only by being in separate rooms. Usually we spend a lot of time exploring and doing things in London, getting around by public transport and on foot. We still walk a lot, but the focus is on exercise rather than exploring, although in the last week we’ve researched and explored a couple of local (hidden and unmarked) archeological sites. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? This hasn’t arisen, I suspect primarily because there has been no driving force from the workplace which previous experience suggests is where the impetus tends to come from eg my introduction to email many years ago was at work where I used it before using it at home. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? Keeping in touch regularly has been with family, and friends without work commitments. I’ve not used any new methods to keep contact(and would not use Zoom anyway) tending to stick with the method that I’ve always used with different people. It has made me realise that I do keep in touch with different people in different ways – phone, text/sms, email and WhatsApp. We have a WhatsApp group of 4 close family members, and then I only use it for 2 of my closest friends – curiously one who lives very close by, and another who moved away from the UK a couple of years ago. If so, what has this been like? It’s made me realise that I use WhatsApp for a chat with people I’m close to. I also like the ability to share, especially photos, with ease. I don’t post on any platforms, although I lurk, as I don’t feel the need to be “out there” and so WhattsApp provides a more managed intimate way of keeping contact, mainly because of who I communicate with rather than the nature of the App. I’ve always felt that WhattsApp groups which to date I’ve resisted joining can be intrusive and overwhelming. Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I checked in on a few people at the start – friends who by the nature of friendship and how it changes over time are people I care about and have known a long time, but our paths cross infrequently. To keep more regular contact now seems an intrusion and would change the dynamic – one friend has returned to healthcare and although I think of him we don’t ordinarily communicate frequently. We had a text conversation when it was announced that retired GPs were being “invited” to return, but since then I’ve held back from getting in touch again as I don’t want him to feel he needs to keep “checking in”. It can be a challenge sometimes just making such regular contact with elderly parents especially when no one has done anything and remaining sympathetic to their situation. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I don’t post on any and am not a FB lurker. I will however, a I always have done, lurk on Twitter looking at the accounts of people who I’ve always dipped into to find different sources of information and reading via links. I have started reading a countrywide community forum as escapism – nothing quite beats spending 10 minutes whilst the pasta is cooking reading a thread called “what’s for tea tonight?”. I’ve always been fascinated by people who prodigiously post anywhere, especially when they start to reveal things about themselves – just as I’m doing here! Perhaps we all need to express ourselves somewhere where we feel comfortable and I like the fact I have a MOA number not a name! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I’ve not been into a shop since lockdown, and although I did occasionally think about popping out to get something, such thoughts are occurring less and less. I started online shopping about 15 years ago, and although I do it less frequently now it wasn’t a huge change for me to arrange this to enable a degree of self isolation. However getting delivery slots for the first few weeks was a challenge and almost became a full time job, at least a preoccupation(and the fuel for a dream/nightmare), especially trying to arrange deliveries for elderly parents and in laws who don’t shop online. We now have a good routine of weekly fruit and veg boxes and a supermarket delivery every couple of weeks, so that I can also order food for a couple of people who are self isolating. I’ve used a breadmaker anyway for 15 years or so, so made sure I had plenty of flour. I’m using the breadmaker more to make dough and then shape prove and bake and cook in the oven because I’m around to do so. It’s enjoyable, the bread is tasty and I’m trying different types. We’re here everyday so dinner is at home and always cooked from scratch. We normallykeep easy food eg a ready meal/pizza, in the freezer for when we go out for the day, or for a quick meal before an evening meeting, but we don’t need to now. I’m cooking a greater variety of meals and looking at recipes – I’ve got the time and I don’t want to waste any food especially from the fruit and veg boxes. I would also say I’m taking more care storing food and keeping the windowsill herbs alive! Because of a shortage of yeast sourdough had its moment which I indulged in. Although the results have been delicious I’m not baking it regularly. I put a starter into hibernation in the freezer a month or so a go and retrieved it yesterday and started feeding it again, so maybe another loaf in a week or so. It seems to be waking up!! Initially the first supermarket delivery was for 4 households which we then delivered – quite an organisational feat. I’ve a couple of friends who can get slots now, and we all check-in with eachother when we have a slot and order items for eachother. My son has worked throughout as a key worker and so I’ve organised deliveries to go there(50 miles away) He is a carer as well so it just didn’t seem right that he should work and then have to queue at the supermarket – the shopping trips having to be frequent as he has no car. Afterthought 28 May 2020 I’m starting to think that the feelings that I had about being thrust into the role of domestic manager are more than just niggles. We’re already seeing that it’s women in the workplace who are more likely to be made redundant but there are signs that there is an increasing burden on women for effective household management. I’ve been considering conversations that I’ve had with friends, all women in conventional stable opposite sex marriages or partnerships. These women are in their 20’s, 40’s, 50’s, 70’s and 80’s. All but the youngest are mothers, and whilst being(or have been) in what would bee considered “professional” jobs, have tended to move more frequently between workplaces and with various mixes of part and full time paid work. Even with adult children it seems that mothers are providing support in for instance getting food. I think the initial shortages and the desire not to enter shops meant we were all furiously organising and planning. It seems to becoming a burden, but maybe it’s just that we’re stuck at home with no escape from partners? There was also a lot of early lockdown house cleaning and tidying by people generally. I woildn’t say that my friends are particularly houses proud, but because this is also linked with hand washing, disinfecting and trying to ensure surfaces are virus free this also seems to be something that’s managed by women. Including ensuring that sufficient cleaning products are in the house. I’m certainly wiping surfaces more frequently than usual(maybe because I’m here) and cleaning the bathroom everyday. It’s drudge so why am I doing it? I need to think more about this and see how it plays out, but I’m getting a sense that women are certainly dealing with increased drudgery, and also that fatal combination of responsibility and some bitterness. A friend said she’d had a “robust conversation” with her husband when we were discussing that “the men” seem to dip into cooking when it suits and don’t take into account that it’s one meal of many in the week when choosing ingredients. Also the default is that we will cook. I’ve much more to say on this but maybe I need to reflect first! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? There was a great flurry at the start of lockdown with people proselytizing about all the life changing achievements we were going to make. I was very sceptical from the start and it seemed it was just a way to generate copy for “lifestyle” pages and gave an opportunity for endless youtube videos. It seemed like some people just couldn’t cope without being governed by the language of scientific management and the need for targets. I also keep thinking that many of these so called projects are merely ways of encouraging people to continue to spend money. We’ve done some sorting and tidying of things that have been niggling for a while, and found cobwebs which normally I wouldn’t bother seeing. The list of thing that we could do around the house has not greatly shortened, but given a free choice I would prefer to read or bake. We walk at least 3 – 4 miles everyday, which is not unusual, and further on other days. I can only think of a handful of days since the restrictions when we’ve not gone for a walk. With the roads so much quieter it’s also felt safer to cycle, which is something that we only normally do when on holiday. I usually swim, but haven’t done so this winter because of surgery, so that wasn’t too much of a shock, although now the weather is nice I do most days think about the joys of sea swimming, which is very important to me over the summer months when we go away for extended periods in our campervan. Oh, and I suppose there’s all the dancing in the kitchen to the music turned up loud whilst cooking and baking. I’ve also been able to be very conscientious about my post operative physio and turned it into a 40 minute workout every other day, with 15 minutes of stretches on alternate days. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I always have a book on the go anyway, but tend to read shorter books so they’re easily thrown into my rucksack, and not too heavy! When the weather has been nice, and as we’re not going out, I’m reading more than usual in the garden(a bit like being on holiday), so I’ve just finished Thomas Mann’s “Buddenbrooks”. It is a hardback, long and heavy, so I’ve been waiting to take it on holiday, but now it will be one of my reading memories of the sunny lockdown spring. I have got more time to read and I think my head must be less cluttered as usual I’m tending to have fiction and non­fiction on the go at the same time, yet m also feel less hurried reading and able to think more deeply about the non fiction whilst still immersing myself in the world that I’m living in through the novels. I’ve watched the first 2 series of “The Wire”, rationed not binged(!), and I’m looking forward to the next one, again not something I would normally commit to. Apart from the news I’ve watched little TV but that’s not unusual. In the early weeks when the evenings were still getting dark earlier, “Bakeoff” and similar light programmes might be on in the background whilst I read the paper online. We usually go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema and also attend public lectures, so at the start thee was an element of “we should have been going to….”. I’ve perhaps listened to more podcasts as a result and we’ve watched a couple of plays online, but neither are substitutes for shared, live events. Podcasts are just different but familiar anyway, whereas I do struggle with watching a play on a small domestic screen, and it’s made me realise how you make your own experience of a play by where you choose to look, whereas the camera does that for you with a broadcast. The result is it takes me much longer to get involved and I’m not convinced I can suspend my disbelief as easily, but having said that, after an initial non plussed 30 minutes, the performance of “A Streetcar named Desire” that we watched last night was totally absorbing. I listen to a variety of podcasts depending on my mood and time from the lightweight (e.g. Fortunately) to the more informative (e.g. Talking Politics, with David Runciman). I can’t abide radio phone ins! The only music radio we have on is Radio 6, as usual, but more of it as I’m at home more and it also provides an automatic disco to dance to whilst cooking. Music is also something my partner and I share – discussing and listening, and hunting out youtube clips. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? The most obvious change is the focus on hand-washing – both frequency and duration – and the resulting need for hand cream. When the weather was still cold I did have an eczema flare up on my hands which was really the only time that hand-washing was painful, and I suppose normally I would have avoided putting my hands in water so frequently. There’s been no significant change, although I’ve noticed that not going on public transport means that clothes don’t get as dirty and there’s not the griminess on the skin which happens when travelling on the tube. The main impact for me, as for everyone, is the inability to get my hair cut. I’d had an appointment booked for March 23, so I’ve not had a cut since 10 Feb. I’m not at all worried about my appearance, but as someone with very thick, short hair it’s uncomfortable in the warm weather, and it’s very obvious that I need a cut. Apart form daily exercise I don’t leave the house/garden I simply use hair grips to hold it back out of my eyes-not exactly flattering but hey The overriding anxiety at the thought of someone cutting my hair is a useful distraction when I wonder which way to try and push my heavy fringe – 4 July is being mooted as a possible date for hairdressers to open, but I won’t be first in the queue. It’s only just struck me that I’ve gone into winter mode for leg shaving – ie not at all! Need to think about that one. Perhaps as we’ve all become a bit more inward looking and isolated it shows just how much pressure there is to have smooth legs, and without social interaction it’s somet"

Tanned Slim Bight-eyed Strong Upright That wasn’t easy.  Hard to use words which don’t imply a reliance on dieting or being body conscious. To be healthy in my mind means to be relaxed and happy in your body. I associate having a tan with the times in my life when I’ve lived in warmer climates around the world, living out of doors more than here in the UK. I found that the Med and the tropics are wonderful for encouraging a kind of natural fitness which can be achieved without formal effort. Swimming, walking and eating less because the body doesn’t need the calories to keep warm makes for an easier way to achieve a healthy body. By slim, I mean not overweight for your build.  Most people I know could do with losing a kilo or two but the few I know who are morbidly overweight know they are and variously don’t acknowledge their weight or put it down to continuing ill health. Therefore in my mind, a healthy body needs to be in proportion. Bright-eyed? I feel that the eyes reflect our sense of well-being.  Stress, happiness, sadness are all shown through the eyes so to be bright eyed to me means a healthy lifestyle. By strong I mean not reliant upon others to help you get around. An independence of spirit can display strength too so friends who use wheelchairs or mobility scooters to get around often show a strength which is remarkable. Upright in stature and mind helps to keep the body healthy. I look at friends who are bent and bowed from arthritis or perhaps another condition don’t appear healthy even though they may feel comfortable in their skin.  I guess my responses show that I do have some form of body consciousness which might conform to an advertising ideal. I’m not a fan of body building so that overly pumped, muscle bound body does not necessarily mean good health. I’ve known many people who have achieved such a body through the use of steroids and ‘health shakes’. That doesn’t work for me and strikes me as profoundly unhealthy. I remember a series of early PHSE classes at secondary school which were more memorable for the embarrassing sex education films shown by the mortified biology teacher. There were, on reflection, some films (they were always government produced films) on eating well and playing netball or W3048 Male 61     Semi-retired  Single     Warminster football and going swimming every week.  They clearly did nothing for me! It’s taken over forty years to remember them.  My parents ate well so I grew up understanding implicitly the joy of a varied diet. My father travelled widely in the sixties and seventies.  After months away in Asia or South America he would return with trays of mango or rambutan. He would tell stories of fabulous steaks in Brazil which were so tender they could be cut with a fork, and of delicious Malaysian seafood stir fries. I guess I grew up enjoying food and drink which very few of my contemporaries had heard of. My father’s stories of meals enjoyed in remote places around the world planted the seed in my head that there were ways of eating healthily which didn’t involve cucumber, mashed swede or school dinners. Not that there’s anything wrong with any of that, but I have realised that my childhood has given me a joy of all foods. I am still amazed by people I meet who will not eat fish and hate a food they’ve never tried.  My father would say, for example, that the people who he worked with in Tokyo enjoyed raw fish (sashimi) and they were all fit and healthy. He would say that they wouldn’t be eating such food if it made them ill, so just try it – you might discover that congee is the most delicious thing you’ve ever eaten. I also learned from my father of colleagues in Hong Kong who would meet to practise Tai Chi every morning and others in India who were practitioners of yoga. These were adults who did the same job as my father so by extension these activities were perfectly normal to me. It was unusual to find tai chi or yoga classes in Crawley in the 60’s so I learned more about them from library books. On moving to London in the late seventies I was able to join classes for the first time – feeling more healthy as a result. I loathe organised sport so joining the local soccer team has never been an option! I’d been through puberty long before then. Shaving and personal hygiene was not something my father explained – he was away somewhere in the world for months on end. My mother avoided discussing puberty with a swift explanation that it was best to bath at least once a week and to use deodorant every day. My much older brother had long left home, so shaving was something I learned about from MS who’d arrived at school aged 12 already shaving twice a day. He ‘taught’ us at school by shaving in the shower after PE, eager but distanced eyes curious to learn how it was done. I’m fortunate that I don’t have such a heavy beard growth so I’m able to go a day or two without the bother of shaving now that my beard is grey.  Such a relief. The one consistent health and well-being routine for my body has been to moisturise.  I have naturally dry skin (living in the tropics was bliss for me) so I have always used some form of moisturising cream or oil.  Over the years I have settled on Aveeno. It seems to be right for my skin. Other formulations have caused spots or rashes after time, but Aveeno works for me.  I had a basal cell carcinoma around seven years ago and during the follow ups with the dermatology consultant he recommended using it daily.  I reasoned that as an expert in skin care then I should listen – and it’s worked.  How fortunate that he didn’t recommend something outrageously expensive. My health and wellbeing routine then is a very simple one. A varied diet, lots of water, the occasional glass of wine, yoga, long walks and moisturiser. How great is that? Simple and straightforward."

Going through a particularly stressful (is there any other kind?) of divorce I was given a gift of the best-selling five-year, single sentence a day ‘Happiness Project’ diary. I have kept this diligently for almost three years now; two to go before the project is complete.  The aim of the dairy is to find something positive to note about each day of your life. I was doing well until Coronavirus.  I have struggled some days to find the good in what is going on around me, which I guess, is not unusual. Observations about the early blossoming of a plum tree or the late flowering of the Bare-Naked Ladies in the lower border seem trite when so much is not right with the world right now. With that in mind, my Coronavirus observation diary is not quite as fulsome as it might have been had I kept, like some will no doubt have done, a daily one. I found that it was quite surprisingly hard to live in lockdown. I thought that I would have no problem with staying in for long periods – after all I live in a beautiful apartment in a listed building, overlooking a walled garden which we are restoring. I am in a new relationship and whilst we both have our own apartment; they are in the same building so that would work well I thought. The sun shone. The birds sang. There was plenty of food in the larder – we are both cooks so making a supper out of a teabag and a piece of bacon rind holds no fears. What surprised me most about lockdown was how often I leave the house when not locked in. I had no idea that I ‘just popped out’ as frequently as I do. I live in the heart of the town so it’s easy to nip over the road to the discount store opposite to pick up some washing up liquid or to visit the Friday Market for a hand of bananas.  I really struggled. Really. I agonised about how to fit as much into my one visit to the supermarket or exercise period.  The high street here was all but empty of traffic and people.  Over a half mile distance only two shops were open at the height of lockdown – Boots and the butcher.  The queues to collect prescriptions at Boots were staggering, stretching far into the distance along the street. Some people wearing masks, some not. Some wearing bandanas, others sipping from bottles of water whilst they waited in the searing heat and full sun of those early weeks. The butcher did good business with a limited range of produce because he had had to let some of his older staff isolate. I realised how much I enjoy talking with shop staff as we tried to get used to talking through face masks.  Lots of eyebrow raising and smiling, frantic nodding and thumbs being raised. I should mention that I was the one who elected to shop whilst my partner stayed inside. His mother was diagnosed near the start of lockdown with terminal cancer and so we reasoned that if he needed to see her then it made sense for him to limit his exposure. I now have proof of the power of love that he managed to stay inside for six weeks, venturing only into our walled garden for fresh air and exercise, and to continue bringing it back to some state of glory after ten years of neglect by the former owners. He was determined that he needed to be as sure as possible that he had not met with the possibility of contracting the virus because he could not bear the thought of never seeing his mother again. As the crisis worsened, I wore a mask more often that at first.  I think that like most people I didn’t think that the mask wouldn’t affect the transmission rate that greatly. There were messages from the WHO I remember that washing hands was much more important than wearing a mask.  Having lived in Hong Kong in the eighties I recalled that mask wearing during times of cold and flu was de rigueur, so I adopted the habit before the government changed its view on masks.  There was for many weeks a mask ‘tree’ in the town where kind hearted tailors and seamstresses made masks and hung them out on a tree near one of the schools for people to help themselves to a free mask in order to stop the spread locally. As a glasses wearer the steaming up issue was solved with a quick coating of washing up liquid, as I do whenever I go skiing. Either that, or spit! Probably best not done in public these days… That reminds me that I should mention that before the full lockdown I was one of those people caught in the mess of the French ski season shutting down.  The usual gang of ten were heading to Tignes for a week in a chalet which we had taken between us all.  Arriving at Gatwick for our early morning EasyJet flight on 14th March, the airport was quieter than usual for ski season but still full of jolly holidaymakers. Walking through security was a breeze, but then it often is at LGW. The first sign that something odd was happening was walking straight into the airside restaurant for our pre-flight breakfast which arrived at the table in the blink of an eye.  With time to kill we strolled around the airside picking up mints, a newspaper, and the usual last-minute bottles of water without queuing once.  If anyone commented on this strange phenomenon I cannot recall.  The plane boarded so quickly and easily it was beginning to dawn on us that some people might have chosen not to fly. As we sat, I counted almost forty empty seats on a ski flight which is usually overbooked. We waited for our departure slot with the door open, seat belts on. I became aware of a chap behind me was out of his seat carrying his open laptop before him as he walked up the aisle.  Talking with his friend a few seats in front of me, the two then lifted their bags from the locker and walked to the front of the plane and the open door.  After a few words with the crew they exited the plane. My first, selfish, thought was that we were going to be delayed as their bags were off loaded.  This was not the case as we pushed back on time and taxied to the end of the runway.  I have flown a lot in for work over the years and know Gatwick well enough to know the heavy departure and arrival times for this single runway airport, so was most surprise when we continued from the taxi to roll directly down the runway and then take off.  Looking back on it, that was the moment when I thought that this could all go horribly wrong; so, few arrivals and departures can only mean the level of passenger traffic was dropping faster than expected. Arriving at Geneva we were met by the ski rep and driven to the chalet.  All was OK according to him, so we got into the holiday mood. A beautiful chalet with two young chalet staff who ran a beach pop up restaurant in Cornwall during the summer boded well for the catering. After an hour, friends from the USA joined us having arrived on a different flight so much celebrating ensued. We were all fitted for skis and collected our lift passes ready to be on the slopes the next day. After a good supper and a few drinks everyone retired for the night.   On waking we discovered that overnight, the French government had decided that all ski lifts must not re-open due to the risk from contamination. There we were with skis, boots, lift passes and nowhere to go.  The holiday company rep was as clueless about the situation as we were so was unable to help.  Social media posts and new websites gave us more of a clue as to what was happening, so we began slowly to realise that we had to get back to the UK somehow. The added complication we faced with changing our flights was that the team leader who had booked it all had been unable to join us on the holiday. So, trying to change the flights when you’re not the lead on an airline booking is not possible. Calls and what’s app messages back and forth to him got us nowhere.  He was either unavailable or our walking the dog at the critical moment when we needed information and help from him, so I made the decision to do it all myself.  I remember shouting that I needed all your passports now! And then using the easyJet app on my phone I found seats for seven of us from Geneva back to Gatwick on Tuesday…. other flights back were disappearing from the booking as soon as I found them.  Having made the bookings we knew at least that we could get back to the UK even if I had had to buy seven more single flights.  I thought that it was better to have the seats on the plane rather than to waste more hours waiting for the ‘team leader’ in the UK to do the same thing.  The minor issue then being how to get off the mountain and across the border into Switzerland and the airport. Back at the chalet, the hosts mentioned that they had no idea what was happening with them either but thought that they would be leaving the resort before the end of the week. After many calls to the resort rep she managed to secure a mini-bus to take us to the airport but could only guarantee that for us on Monday so we’d need to find somewhere to stay in Geneva Monday night.  The US couple volunteered to take care of that and so with access to the internet and some pretty fast research they found a hotel a short walk from the airport but could only book two suites – boys in one, girls in the other.   Packing up after Sunday supper was depressing having seen nothing of the slopes but walking around the base of them and admiring the few people who had managed to carry their skis up the mountain to ski back down!   We occupied ourselves on the Monday by walking as far as we could up a slope nearby to have a picnic in the snow overlooking the resort in blazing sun and perfect skiing conditions. Whilst on the mountain one of our party got a call from the resort rep to say we needed to leave in an hour as the border between France and Switzerland was being closed that evening. We slid down the mountain on our bottoms to get back to the chalet in time. On our return we found the hosts had packed up and gone leaving a Marie Celeste meal half prepared, table laid, a fridge full of food and supplies still in the storeroom for a season which, just as it looked from the exceptional conditions could have extended beyond the expected end, was now over. The minibus arrived and a couple of hours later we squeezed across the border, which I understand closed to traffic from France thirty minutes later. The hotel was a short walk under the highway from Geneva airport and as such was heaving with people trying to check in or attempting to book rooms on spec. Our rooms were adjacent on the fifth floor. A double in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. The restaurant was closed – the Swiss had already closed all public restaurants and bars. We bought food from a supermarket a short walk away which was allowing six people in at a time. No masks but distancing where possible in the queue and inside. There was no limit on purchases so the local people shopping there were stocking up on toilet paper and wine I seem to remember.  We bought fruit and yoghurts for breakfast, cheeses, cured meats, and olives for supper.  We also purchased cereal bars and bottled water for the airport as we had a feeling that things may be a little busy there at check-in. After shopping, three of us walked to the airport terminal alongside people wheeling baggage trolleys and suitcases. We found an underpass from the back of the hotel to the entrance piazza which meant that it would be much easier for everyone to take their bags and skis the next morning. The armed police at the door let us in as we had a booking (even though it was for the following day). The airport was busy but not overloaded with people. We bought coffee and pastries from a lovely little café on the ground floor. Then joined a short queue at the easyJet booking desk to see whether we could move our booking to that afternoon or evening when they had other flights. Before I’d opened my mouth the middle aged Swiss easyJet ground agent told me that ‘no, there are no seats on any flight today or tomorrow’ She then launched into a diatribe about how this virus was a man-made event, designed by a huge corporation in order to make money. She blamed the Chinese and the Americans. ‘it’s all on the internet.  Take a look. You’ll see I’m right’. I back away from her and told the others that we’d have to stick with our original plans to leave the following afternoon.  As we left the airport appeared busier with more people joining the queues at all the various airline desks and check in counters, whether they were staffed or not. Supper in the girls’ suite enjoying the food and wine from the supermarket followed by a walk in the deserted streets as the sun set. The next morning, we checked out amid scenes of chaos in the hotel lobby. People (mostly British) screaming at the receptionist that they needed a room, even though the hotel was full. They demanded breakfast, even though the hotel restaurant couldn’t open by law. Our American friends had managed to find flights to Schiphol from where they could fly back to the New Orleans, so they were staying another night, leaving the next day. They were moved from the suite to a rooftop room with a huge balcony as we’d been so helpful and understanding to the staff who were being given such a hard time by the desperate and rude travellers who’d appeared in the hotel. The rest of us walked across to the airport. The security on the door was more strict – three armed police officers and the necessity of showing our boarding passes on the phone.  Check-in was heaving. Stacked three deep with people everywhere. Clearly some had spent the night on the floor there with young families. Our flight was at four pm and we soon learned that we could join the lengthy check-in line until two hours before our two-hour check-in time of two pm. We hung around, sitting on the floor reading and chatting amongst the sea of people also waiting for hours until we could approach the guards on the check-in zone. We joined the snaking queue, which was definitely not a metre apart, no masks visible anywhere and no attempt at distancing in the queue.  An hour later we’d checked in and were allowed an hour later to go through security. Once through to the UK departure zone things were calmer with a café selling a reduced range of drinks and food but without the long wait landside.  The flight arrived on time. We boarded promptly and soon realised that although boarding was complete, the plane was only three-quarters full.  I’d seen when booking online that it was fully booked but the reality was very different. Perhaps other passengers had taken other flights or had been unsuccessful getting to the airport. Back at Gatwick, we walked though immigration with ease, the baggage came through very quickly. The airport appeared quiet and our cab was waiting in a car park which seemed to be only half full. Quiet roads and an easy journey back to Esher where I had left my car, whilst hearing from the driver all about the panic buying going on. That was our skiing holiday 2020.  Saw the snow. Ate some nice food. Drank a little. Got to know Geneva airport better than I thought I would.  Failed to ski. Not long after this experience, Dominic Cummings decided he was above the law and did what he did. His lack of contrition, his sense of entitlement and that unforgivable scruffy oik performance in the garden of 10 Downing Street was a game changer. Not just for me but for everyone I know.  Since Boris Johnson allowed his bestie to break the law and get away with driving to his second home because ‘he did what he felt was right for his family’ I have decided to take the same approach. Whilst not breaking the law, I am happy to stick to the current (October 2020) requirements to meet in groups of no more than six, I do practise what I feel to be sensible precautions.  I no longer watch any government briefings on the TV or listen to advice from the cabinet; I do not feel they deserve my time.  I wash my hands frequently, wear a mask whenever I’m out of the house, try to avoid public transport and register my location in whatever manner I’m asked on the rare occasions now that I visit a restaurant or pub. I could have written pages more on the peculiarities of not being allowed to sing with my choir whilst being welcome to go to a comedy club for an evening of stand-up comedy surrounded by people laughing their socks off in an enclosed space. Not being able to pop into a National Trust garden on spec whilst being welcome onto one of their crowded beaches. Being able to walk five minutes to the huge Wetherspoons pub with its food, live music and quiz nights but not being able to enjoy my local pub which serves only beer and wine, but no food or quizzes or music across the road as it’s too small to have tables a metre apart. I can hold a funeral for 15 – oh wait, no, that’s now 30 but only with masks, no singing, no flowers and no pall bearers; I can hold a wedding for just 15 which includes me – what’s the difference? It is a gathering of people for a rite of passage. And what about baby naming ceremonies, they are not formal christenings, so is it only for six people or fifteen or thirty? I have no idea and the rules for Celebrants seem to change every couple of weeks. It is no wonder that the British people are confused."

No: C3603 Male â€“ born 1944 Married â€“ Living in Oughtibridge, Sheffield Retired Youth & Community Officer Vaccine My wife and I (both in our mid-70s) have now been given two Covid-19  Pfizer vaccinations. We received our first jabs on 13th January 2021. We each had our second jabs on 1st April 2021. Without any prompting or inquiry on our part -our local GP Surgery contacted us by phone to tell us the time, date and location of our first vaccination. It was explained that several local GPs were working together and that patients of all those GPs would attend the same location -Valley Medical Centre in Stocksbridge. The centre is only 6 miles from our house. We could have travelled by bus, but as we have been avoiding public transport since the Covid outbreak -we drove to the venue in our own car. A simple 12 minute journey. We had been advised not to arrive more than ten minutes before our 1-00pm appointment. We parked in a half empty supermarket car park -and walked the 150 yards to the medical centre. A volunteer pointed us in the direction of about 20 people  queuing outside.  I thought we might be waiting in line for a while -but we were dealt with very quickly. The person staffing the arrival desk merely asked for our names -and which surgery we were registered with. So, just a couple of minutes to confirm our arrival -then we were directed inside via a hand sanitizer table.  About 20 folk in the communal waiting room -all sitting on socially distanced chairs. We were sat facing the open door of the 'jabbing room' and were called in together within a few minutes. Not sure who vaccinated us -but it was performed quickly and painlessly. As we exited from being jabbed we were given a sticker to wear showing the exact time we had been jabbed. Were told we would need to wait for 15 minutes before leaving to check we didn't suffer from any immediate after effects.  We didn't -so left the centre through a one way system, walked to our car -and drove home. The whole journey time and vaccination took exactly one hour. Very well organised and efficient procedure. Both had slightly sore arms for a couple of days -but absolutely no other side effects. C3603 Eleven weeks after our first jab -we had a phone call from our GP surgery giving us a date and time for our second jab. This took place at 10-55am on 1st April -again at the Valley Medical Centre. Slightly fuller waiting room this time so we anticipated a longer wait. But there were separate 'jabbing rooms' for patients registered with different GPs and we were called in almost immediately. Again -very swift and painless jab -and sticker to wear showing the time we were jabbed and told we must wait for 15 minutes. A volunteer (I assume they were a volunteer) kept an eye on our stickers -and after the 15 were up -told us we could go. Apart from slight soreness at the site of the vaccination for the following two days -absolutely no other side effects. We were given our vaccination card after the first jab showing that we had received the Pfizer vaccine -and its batch number. This card was updated after our second jab showing the date and batch number of the Pfizer vaccine. My wife and I never had any qualms about being vaccinated. We regarded having our Covid-19 jabs as just like having our annual flu jab. We were neither anxious, nor elated, to have been jabbed. We had our vaccinations because it was common sense to do so. I can't comment about how the vaccination programme has been delivered in the wider area. I am aware that neighbours either side of us have all received their first dose -but haven't been in touch with them sufficiently to know which vaccine they received -or at what venue they attended. We get on well with our neighbours -but have obviously not been in each others houses during the pandemic.  Conversations have been short -and across the garden fence when when the weather has allowed. Our neighbours are younger than us -so I think they are still awaiting their second jabs. We have been very cautious since the outbreak of the pandemic and have stayed at home (with very occasional walks round the local park) for the past 14 months. Our elder son is a NHS hospital respiratory physiotherapist and has been treating Covid patients for more than a year now.  Because he saw at first hand the seriousness of the pandemic he advised us very early on (actually he instructed us) to stay put and not venture out. We have followed his instructions. Even with the easing of restrictions we are still being exceedingly cautious. Contact with our two sons and their families has been via the internet, phone, texting etc. -or through balcony to pavement shouted conversations. C3603 I am aware that, for a variety of reasons and/or fears, some people will refuse to be vaccinated but I would oppose it being made mandatory. I have long been wary of governments (including our own) imposing measures. Government by diktat must be opposed. May 2021"

Mass-Observer P1796 describes themself as female; age 73; married; retired.;The Directive 'COVID-19 and Time' was issued on 7 August 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in relation to the 'rhythm and routine of the day'; 'homelife'; use of 'media and technology'; their experiences of 'waiting'.,"PART 1 - COVID-19 AND TIME  Rhythm and routine of the day. Indeed my daily life and routine have definitely changed beginning with the lockdown when I only went out of the house each day for exercise and to pick up the paper, that was the extent.  Compare this to pre lockdown, when I was out and about all the time, rushing from one place to another and always trying to find some spare time.  So how would I cope with all this spare time, well amazingly well which really surprised me.  Ofcourse the weather was glorious in the lockdown which was a huge benefit, as for the first time I was able to spend time in the garden and the allotment, something I really enjoyed and needless to say the garden and allotment benefitted.  I could no longer go to the gym or swim but I needed exercise, although I previously did cycle a couple of times a week.  However I had to get into a new routine, so ended up cycling 4 times a week and jogging 3 times a week, I love cycling but not keen on jogging.  I went out first thing in the morning around 6.30 and it was lovely, very few people around and they ended up becoming regulars. I would then pop into our local Spar en route home and pick up the paper wearing gloves but no mask.  Big change here as I needed to pop the outer pages of the paper in the microwave to disinfect it, not sure whether this was correct but seemed like a good idea.  At 10 am we would stop whatever we were doing and have a coffee and read the paper; here again so different from before, when I was lucky if I had time to read the paper when having a coffee.  At 11am my husband would go for a walk as he needed some exercise and it gave me the opportunity to get onto the computer and keep up with any admin I needed to do.  At 12 we would have lunch and then around 2 would head to the allotment for an hour, back home for cup of tea, make supper, and then watch TV.    We did see our neighbours from a distance and would chat to them and then we started Facetiming our family and then Zoom became part of our lives.  At the time of lockdown I was President of our local Inner Wheel Club and I decided that if we couldn’t see each other face to face, we needed to see each other virtually.  I had never used or in fact heard of Zoom but I soon learnt how to use it and got a regular weekly session going.  It was lovely to see ladies, who up until then had not really used their computers/tablets/phones for anything like this, really get into it and enjoy it.  As well as doing a weekly Zoom meeting, I also started a weekly newsletter to all the ladies telling them what I was doing, what was going on and asking them to reply stating what they were doing to pass the time.   I feel I got to know some of them a lot better during this time and was actually quite sad when with the end of my year as President in mid July I no longer did this.  As my husband and I are both retired we obviously were not involved in the furlough scheme, however 2 of our grandchildren were, and 1 still is I am sorry to say, but hoping that this will end in September, he needs to be back at work.   We live by the sea, in a very popular area for visitors, and the road outside our house can get very noisy during the summer season.  We both loved the fact that there were no cars on the road, the quiet was heavenly, we could hear the birds singing.  So then lockdown was eased and everything changed.  People started arriving, roads got busy and the harbour was packed and our lives started changing again.  However certainly not back to normal and in some ways this is harder, as people seem to want to push the boundaries of what you can/cant do and yet the virus is still here.  It has been lovely of course to see our family who we have missed, and we have had some friends over but certainly nothing like before and we are both reluctant to go any further.   I have now gone back to the gym twice a week but here again very early, and with the restrictions operating for gyms, currently there are usually only 6-7 people, so feel comfortable with that. We have to pre book our sessions which last 75 minutes, but having to clean all the equipment each time you use it, means that the 75 minutes go by quickly.  In addition our gym is now in 3 seperate areas which adds to the time. In addition we have started netball training, all within a 2 metre square which is kind of weird but better than nothing. Lovely to be able to go to the hairdressers and beautician, and for my husband to be able to play golf and get some more exercise.  We still haven’t been out to a restaurant.  We have taken day trips out to a number of National Trust properties and have enjoyed a change of scenery, but when you live in such a beautiful area it is not so important.  Here again you have to pre book your entry time to the NT grounds, but we haven’t found this too much of a problem.  Homelife There are just the two of us in the household, and I think I have already described how we have spent our time during and coming out of lockdown.  I definitely enjoy having more time to myself and wonder how I am going to cope, if and when they get a vaccine, and we can get back to more normality. I miss being able to go out for lunch with friends and also my husband, being able to do things on the spur of the moment, everything now has to be planned in advance.  Media & technology Certainly for me technology has been great, I did use it a lot prior to Covid so was well versed in its uses, but the extra time I had meant that I was prepared to try and learn more of what I could do.  As I said Zoom probably was the biggest change for me and something that I think will continue to feature in our lives.  I think that the way that we used our medical services will definitely benefit by more use of technology.  I am more than happy to have an initial consult either by phone or virtually, and in fact had one during June which so impressed me because I got to speak to a consultant within 2 weeks, whereas normally I would have to wait anywhere between 2-3 months if I was lucky! Obviously this would not always be the case, but if the initial consult could be done like this, then it would allow Drs hopefully more time with patients.   I have used online shopping for many years, mainly as I am not keen on grocery shopping at the best of times, and also we only have 1 big supermarket close by which I am not keen on.  Due to the initial problems with getting a delivery slot, I started using another company which is more expensive but had the slots.  Once things settled down a bit, my regular supermarket then had slots and so I now alternate between the 2.  I have been considering going back to my regular deliveries every 2 weeks, but who knows if we will have another lockdown and I don’t want to be prevented from getting my slot. We did invest in a Smart TV in January this year, so this has proved a real bonus as we were then able to sign up to Amazon Prime and Netflix, so we have had many programmes to choose from.  Waiting Yes to a certain extent I do feel my life has been put on hold, and I felt I have missed out on our great granddaughter growing up. She is 21 months now and has changed so much during this spell, and I feel she also has missed out on so much as well.  Fortunately we Facetime our granddaughter so were able to see the little one running around, and in fact our great granddaughter Facetimed me the other day by herself!!!  Obviously as we are getting older, we wanted to do some more travelling particularly as we no longer have a dog.   What has amazed us both is just how the time goes by and it seems it is the weekend again.  At this point I will add that we have not changed our drinking habits during Lockdown, we only drink Friday, Saturday & Sunday in the evenings.  However we do treat ourselves to some bubbly once a fortnight, but apart from that no change.  Even now I rarely go into town, so haven’t had to queue that much.  I think the worst experience I had was early on, when our pharmacy was inundated and people were waiting 5-6 hours just to get their prescription.  I did go down at 6.45 in the morning to queue for my husband’s prescription, he took my place at 8.30, the pharmacy did not open till 9, and got his prescription at 9.30.  At that point we decided to change from this pharmacy and we went online to get ours delivered to the house.  Once this was set up it has been great and we certainly will not be going back to having to pick up a perscription. I am fine with waiting to go into a shop as the weather is nice, but wonder how we will all cope in the winter.  One of the other reasons for not going into town, is that I am not keen on having to wear a mask purely because I wear glasses, and although I have tried a number of different options, my glasses seem to mist up. I prefer to do things online.   Fortunately neither of us have had major problems with health, couple of times we have used the online system and it has worked well for us, but I know that this is not the case for everyone.  In our area we have have very low rates of Covid so we have been lucky.  Other things that have changed  There are a number of things that have changed that I wanted to flag up, although I couldn’t really find a section to put them in but felt they were important to note. Firstly in those weeks of lockdown, we didn’t use our cars, we only went to the allotment so needless to say we still had petrol/diesel in our cars when lockdown was over and of course during lockdown the price of oil slumped!! Cash virtually became extinct, my husband to this day, still has £30 in his wallet that he had on March 23rd nearly 5 months ago because we have gone contactless.  We had been gradually using less cash for quite a while, but now it became the normal way to go. They did up the limit from £30 to £45 which helped.  Mind you it does seem strange to use an app to pay £0.40 for an hour’s car parking!  Previously we would buy a year’s car parking permit but no point as I probably only use the car parks twice a week and sometimes my husband doesn’t use them at all. One of the major downsides of this virus has been our church closed and is still not open.  The church is one of 6 in the team, and due to ours being located in the centre of a busy tourist area, it was felt it would be difficult to open once permission had been given. The need to keep numbers coming in for private prayer down, and the fact that you would need at least 2 people in attendance was going to be hard.  In addition the church had said that anyone over 70 could not do this job and as our congregation are 95% over 70 this was impractical.  So our church was designated as the funeral church, meaning that all funerals over the 6 churches in the team would be held here, and the funeral directors had agreed to clean the areas used after the service.  Fortunately to date we have only had 2 funerals. However we have had an online service each week, and although the team now has a service at one of the churches, as only 35 people can attend, the online service continues.  Its not the same but at least it helps. Prior to the virus, we had all been working hard to cut down on the use of plastics in all forms but particularly plastic bags and we were getting very good at it, of course helped by the fact that you now had to pay for them in shops.  Most people had long life bags which they took with them to the supermarkets etc.  However with online deliveries once again we have gone back to plastic bags which I hate, but apparently this is the only way that supermarkets can safely deliver your shopping.  I am every hopeful that an alternative can be found.   People during this time seemed to have become more caring of others, willing to do more for others whoever they are.  I think the weekly clapping for the NHS was amazing, this was one way that anyone could show that they cared. I trust that we do not loose this. As many people started working from home, and in fact continue to do so, it was reported that a lot of them would stay all day in their pyjamas, or else dress in tee shirts and joggers, occasionally putting on a shirt or blouse if they were having an office Zoom meeting.  I can honestly say that I did not change what I wore any different from what I would normally do and I would put my make up on every day regardless of not going out. I have missed wearing a lot of my clothes as I haven’t gone anywhere to wear them, I wonder how many other women did the same."

Although I and my husband are not entitled to public health care, the Spanish national government commited to vaccinate all those resident in Spain regardless of nationality or their entitlement to public healthcare. However in order to receive the vaccine we had to register with the regional health authority through a special procedure. Once registered the health authority would send us a text message with the date, time and location for our vaccination. I received my text on Sunday 16th May 2021 calling me for my first dose at 1.15pm on 18th May and my second dose at 8.10pm on the 8th June. On both occasions I had to go to my local townâ€™s â€˜multi use centreâ€™. This is a local authority building used for conferences, shows etc and it was administered by a nurse from the regional health service. The atmosphere was very friendly, very clam and it was very quick. I timed it and it took 3 minutes from entering the building to register at the reception desk and to receive my jab. I the had to wait 15 minutes before I could leave, although there were people waiting more than 15 minutes as they had seen friends or neighbours and were happily chatting away, so the staff were politely asking them to leave. I travelled to the vaccination centre by car, it is about a 5 minute drive from our house and here is free parking right outside the centre. I received 2 does of the Pfizer vaccine and had absolutely no problems or side effects. I didnâ€™t feel the nurse inject me and when I said I was ready she said she had already jabbed me. I didnâ€™t have any mark or reddening at the injection site, no pain numbness or any reaction to suggest I had had the vaccine. I still follow the government guidelines and restrictions as in Spain they are strictly enforced. I have never had any major disagreements with the Spanish restrictions even though they were very harsh at the outset, I would prefer to have restrictions so people are protected and that they are only lifted once the pandemic is under control. The Madrid Government region had very lax restrictions and as such have had one of the highest infection and death rates in Spain. I have never had any worries about the safety of any of the vaccines. When I was young I was vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, TB and when travelling against rabies, and I never worried about them then and I donâ€™t worry about them now. At times like these you have to believe the scientists, and I believe that in both the UK and across Europe the scientists and medical experts have been open and honest with people, although I wouldnâ€™t necessarily say the same about the politicians! The Vaccine Programme in Spain Initially the Spanish vaccine programme got off to a slow start due to a lack of vaccines in the most part due to failings in the European Commissionâ€™s vaccine procurement programme. I had some sympathy with the vaccine manufacturers as they were being asked to develop, test, and manufacture millions of doses within record times. I think that all in all the vaccine manufacturers did really well. Politicians as usual were only concerned with their own reputations, the Commission President, Ursula von de Leyen defended the European procurement debacle by saying that manufacturers had breached the delivery conditions in the contract and that she wasgoing to â€˜seizeâ€™ vaccines destined for other countries. It was embarrassing and political grandstanding at the worst possible time. Whilst I condemn any politicians being threatened or abused either online or in public, one day they might want to sit back and reflect on why their citizens feel compelled to behave this way towards them. Both in Spain and the UK throughout the pandemic politicians and their advisers have consistently been caught flouting the rules that they expect the public to follow. The pandemic has shown with great clarity the contempt that politicians have for the people they are elected to â€˜serveâ€™. Now in Spain the vaccination programme is on track, as of the end of July 2021 66% of the population have had a least one jab and 55% have had two. They are expected to be on target for 70% of the population being vaccinated by the end of August. The Valencian Regional government have now started vaccinating teenagers and the 20 to 30 age group, and have also launched a vaccination programme for homeless people. The Valencian Regional Government provide detailed information about the vaccination programme every Saturday which the media normally publish on the Monday. The mainstream media in Spain, as are the majority of the population, pro-vaccine so there is little reporting of misinformation. Health advice is available online, over the phone or via email through the regional governments â€˜citizenâ€™s mailboxâ€™. When I needed some advice on how to register for the vaccine I used the citizen mailbox and they responded throughly within 24 hours. Making vaccines mandatory Both I and my husband have European vaccine certificates and they are automatically available online 48 hours after your second jab. You just download them or print them off. I donâ€™t think there is a yes / no answer to vaccine â€˜passportsâ€™ (I donâ€™t think the term is very useful) it is all a matter of risk. Governments have an obligation to their citizens when it comes to public health and to take adequate precautions to protect them. There is nothing new in this, there were several public health laws introduced in the mid 1800â€™s to deal with outbreaks of cholera which focused on improving sanitation. So governmentâ€™s have, should and will continue to take action to protect public health. As to â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ again this isnâ€™t new. I mentioned earlier that I had to have a rabies jab, this was a requirement of my travel insurers prior to a trip to India in 1989. In fact I had a small yellow booklet issued by British Airways called an â€˜International Certificate of Vaccinationâ€™ (copy attached below) which was stamped by the doctorâ€™s once I had had my various jabs and I had to show it to immigration officers when I returned to the UK. I donâ€™t think vaccine passports will become a feature of foreign travel, only if a risk is identified and a vaccination certificate is usual to mitigate that risk. I know that there is a prevailing argument that â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ will create a two tier society of those able to travel and those not able to travel, but this has always been the case. People can only travel if they afford it, and how much they can afford will determine where and how they can travel. So economics has always played a part in creating a travel divide, I think when talking about a pandemic where your health could endanger the health of someone else, it makes sense to mitigate that with a vaccination certificate. Similarly pre-pandemic all public events had to be risk assessed and the pandemic just adds another dimension to this. While covid is still spreading it might be prudent for organisers to ask for vaccination certificates to access an event to stop it becoming a â€˜superspreader eventâ€™. I donâ€™t think it is for government to mandate blanket rules for such things especially when the pandemic now seems under greater control. Health and safety at events, clubs, pubs etc should be left to the organisers/owners to assess the risk, and act accordingly as they have done in the past, and vaccination certificates would become part of the mitigation of covid risks. Consequently, I donâ€™t think any vaccinations should become mandatory but people need clear advice and credible voices so they can make informed decisions as to whether they want to be vaccinated. However an individuals decision making process should recognise that if they choose not to be vaccinated this may result in some of their individual freedoms being temporarily curtailed. Whilst an individual has a human right to make choices in relation to their own health, others have a similar human right to both enjoy good health and that public threats to their health are managed, either by risk management or by legislation if necessary."

The first time I was travelling back from England last summer and had to be tested at the airport when I arrived in Jersey. There was quite a long queue so it took a while to get through the whole procedure. The woman doing the test had to do it twice for some reason. I thought I was  going to gag but didn't. I had hoped to have the result the following day but on the third day I phoned up and received a negative result. I suspect from the reaction of the woman on the line that I should have received it earlier.The second time was about a month ago. A friend of mine, in spite of being double jabbed, had tested positive after she had what she thought was a bad cold. I had been with her one afternoon about the time she thought she had started it and had been in the car with her for two short journeys. It was on the Thursday when she told me and I had to wait to be called for an appointment for a PCR test. Initially I was worried as my partner was staying with me and isn't vaccinated but I didn't have any symptoms so hoped for the best. He was more concerned about having to rearrange his flights and his car parking. We decided not to think or worry about it unless we had a positive result. I also texted another friend who I had been with on the beach a couple of days after. She phoned me as she had run into the husband of our friend and couldn't remember if they had hugged but that had been outside. At that stage I didn't know if he had it but it turned out he had. I was a bit concerned as also on the beach, I had hugged her sister who has cancer, and niece. We decided that being outside wasn't so risky. She was due to be tested anyway as she goes to visit her mother in a care home.On the Monday morning I still hadn't heard anything so phoned up and got an appointment later that morning. Again I think I had been missed out. It was a very efficient procedure, the drive through testing was done at the harbour which is only a ten minute drive from me and we didn't have to wait at all. My partner was tested at the same time. The actual test was better than the first time. I didn't feel like gagging. We were both a bit distracted for the rest of the day. The result was texted to us later that afternoon. Our phones both pinged at the same time and we looked at each other and tentatively picked them up. Luckily it was negative so we hugged each other with relief. I immediately texted my friend who was very relieved. She had been very apologetic and feeling rather guilty I think I also texted my other friend who was also relieved."

The over 65s had been advised not to go out a couple of weeks before our lockdown so my art groups ended. Consequently I didn’t have to be anywhere at any time.  Although I want to be back at my activities I must admit that I don’t feel that enthusiastic at the prospect of having to get up slightly earlier and actually be somewhere on time.  Generally I slowed down.  Because I have the radio on I was always aware of what time it was and I tended to wake up at my usual time especially with the light mornings.  I got into the habit of having my daily walk in the morning which I have tried to keep up. I completely got out of the habit of looking at my diary. I would say that since the lockdown I have become much more comfortable with being at home on my own.  Media and Technology  I haven’t had much success with using online technologies to speak to people.  Initially after many problems I was connected to Skype to call my cousin in Canada.  I think we only managed to chat a couple of times successfully.  Initially I had a problem with the sound which I managed to sort out after nearly having a nervous breakdown.  The next thing was I was locked out and in spite of my computer chap sorting it out it happened again so I decided to abandon that.  He thought the account had been hacked so I thought it was too risky. I found it rather inconvenient anyway trying to fit it with the time difference and having to hang around for the agreed time getting nervous.  A couple of weeks ago a friend tried to sort me out with Zoom.  We managed to get vision and I could hear her but she couldn’t hear me.  Other friends use their mobile phones to call abroad.  WhatsApp I think it is but I don’t have the right sort of phone for that.  Waiting I have recently travelled to England.  Returning to Jersey I needed to get a Covid test.  After we collected our luggage there was a long queue because we could only go in batches.  I think it must have taken 40 minutes.  Having travelled from a Green Zone I was told I didn’t need to self isolate however I couldn’t attend any gatherings indoors.  I had hoped to get the result within 48 hours but it took far longer so I felt rather in limbo not knowing when it would arrive and if I would be able to get to classes I had arranged to go to."

Living Fylde coast,N. W. England.SUMMER DIRECTIVE 2021Part 1. Covid -19: Testing StoriesWell, I've not much to say on this topic. I had my two vaccinations in January and early April and apart from a few days in south Wales by coach, when temperature checks were done before boarding, I've not been anywhere. Just food shopping in the main.I have never been asked to take a test - maybe because of my age and also I do not have a smart phone.When eating out, once guidelines slackened, I have been asked for a contact phone number to Track and Trace. This I loathe. It feels like an invasion of my privacy, especially if I have just called somewhere for a cup of coffee. If with other people, I usually let them give their phone number.I'm not sure how accurate these quick tests are, when you read about schoolchildren faking them to get out of lessons. My cleaners, who come every two weeks get regular testing, as does the lady who comes to my home every five weeks to attend to my feet. The latter has also had problems with her schoolchildren who have been constantly sent home, even though they have not tested positive, because others in their bubble/football team have, meaning she often has to re arrange her appointments.Any workmen I've had in have always worn masks, even now, in August, and I do in supermarkets, chemists and small shops. However, visiting Morrisons supermarket today most people in my age group were wearing masks but holidaymakers were not. (Maybe they would at home, where they would see people they know??)On Saturday my partner and I went on a day's coach trip to the Lake District - I think most of the coachload were pensioners - and we were temperature-checked at each stop where we boarded and had been instructed to wear masks. This time all the coach seats were filled whereas earlier in the year there were just 30 of us. It was rather hot and uncomfortable.But once in the Lakes no-one bothered, although it was very, very crowded in places. Thankfully the pubs and restaurants were not taking details or expecting masks. There were even notices saying 'You are welcome to stand and drink at out bar'!1From G22612.8.2021Deepdale, Preston, Lancs.M&S storeFood dept were giving out these cards, free, according to how much you spent! I spent about £20 so got offered this one, but the couple in front in the queue had a huge trolley-load and got about 10 cards.I can only assume that the cards were not selling well. A nice idea, but it’s very difficult trying to get the price tag off! So thought you might like it. Most people were still wearing face masks but I liked the “Face masks – it’s your choice” at the store entrance."

Retired writer/counsellor Living Fylde coast, N.W. England SUMMER DIRECTIVE 2020 Part 1                           Covid-19 and Time  Preamble When I wake up I have to think what day it is – and I am often a day ‘out.’  Every weekend seems like a Bank Holiday weekend.  Yet I live on my own and am used to my own company.  But the lockdown has meant that as a recognised forward planner I have been unable to plan ahead.  My diary, until recently, has been devoid of entries. As a car driver, during the first couple of weeks of lockdown, I felt very guilty indeed if I drove on the almost empty roads between one and two miles for a choice of supermarket shopping.  I rehearsed what I would say if I was stopped by the police.  I live in a coastal resort and when the weather is good there is heavy traffic from inland heading for our beaches.  It is those people the police were really after as they leave so much litter on the beaches and have no thoughts about self distancing. EVERYTHING takes longer for me to do now.  I accept that at my age I am slowing down and wanting a short after-lunch nap is no disgrace, but getting ready to go out ...  Have I got enough cash or do they only take cards?  Are there enough clean face masks in the car or do I need one from the drawer?  At least I only need to colour my eye lids and brows.  And it was not until fairly recently, when I arrived at the hairdresser’s with steamed-up mask and specs that I discovered I had been using the masks the wrong way up! My hands have been sanitised to death and need moisturising when I get home.  I still do one large shop a week – to get it over – but will put off  going  shopping for other things and have ordered more on-line than usual. (From Amazon: books, booze and biscuits, the latter for a friend who does not use the internet and has protein bars after training).  Also, spending time finding suppliers for printer inks as the shops have run out.  And a new top for a treat, though may not even wear it until next year). Garden plants have been flowering early and there was much plant-sharing among residents at the retirement complex where I live.  (We have gardeners but many people like attending to the borders opposite their flat).  With no planes and trains for a while things have been quieter except for the birdsong.  Our neurotic grey squirrel has been digging up the back lawn as usual and – a rare treat – we seem to have a family of hedgehogs living by the back railway line.  The little ones are cute.  I go to bed the same sort of time – between 10.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. and only put my alarm clock on if I HAVE to get up, which, since lockdown, isn’t very often.  I am sleeping more in the mornings.  If I am too sleepy to reach for the bedroom radio for the 8 a.m. news, well, there is always the 9 a.m. news. (Classic FM). I really don’t know what happened to the first three months of lockdown.  It seems only last week we were celebrating my birthday in a restaurant on March .  Summer seems to have been and gone (we didn’t get much sun and hot weather up here). I do not use social media at all and have not got a smart phone.  I am beginning to feel somewhat left out as with no family there are not the young people around to instruct me.  For a few Thursdays I joined immediate neighbours clapping for the NHS but it seemed a bit false and apart from seeing them in the garden or in the car park occasionally, there has been little interaction. Our manager is sticking to the rules, so no gatherings in the communal lounge and only one person at a time in the laundry room.  (I don’t live in the main block and seldom use the laundry as I have my own washer-dryer but it was somewhere where people met for a chat).  I wonder if we will ever have social events here again? I am no longer quite so obsessed with The News, though usually put the TV on for the 6 p.m. news, having heard it on the radio and on line a lot of the day.  I am usually in the kitchen with my first drink of the day (whisky) preparing a meal.  I less frequently watch the evening TV news now, preferring to go bed with a book. Now it is September. My diary is filling up with appointments for chiropody, an eye test, physio, and, this afternoon, a scale and polish at the dentist.  I know I am luckier than many, and grateful that I still drive. A friend has just realised that his appointment by a hospital consultant about his two hips is by PHONE- and he doesn’t have Zoom, etc though the mind boggles.  A local friendship group leader phones me occasionally as I am not on social media which connects her to many members.  I did attend a socially distanced event in a park but it was cold and I didn’t really enjoy it.  She somehow makes me feel needy ( which some of the older members are) but, honestly, I’m not.  It’s just that I don’t have relatives and friends have been seeing their  grandchildren etc as soon as lockdown slackened a bit. I do miss my U3A friends but neither of the two groups I belong to have done anything on line and I heard this morning that it is likely that it will be 2021 before we all meet up again. I’ve taken my library books back but have yet to ring for an appointment – 30 mins to browse then take up to four books.  They are open mornings only now and not Saturdays which is another social routine gone: library then coffee and chat with friends. I’d really hoped to get more of the book I’m writing done during lockdown but somehow it didn’t.  There was one week when I got really depressed – sometime in May – and did little but cry and sleep.  Last week I felt I was getting into a similar state but L talked me round.  He wants me to finish my book.  It’s complicated. It will be a tribute to his late wife whose two books I copy edited and this is all my own writing – a sort of ‘what happened next?’ Afternoons seem shorter than ever, especially as I do seem to have my lunch at home later and later, preferring to finish whatever piece of work I’m writing. I’ve bought a cheap pocket diary for 2021 so I live in hope that life will continue, preferably get better ( whatever that means) and that I will be alive and the book finished, for my 80th birthday next year.   2.09.2020"

My eldest son has just begun to work as a civil servant as a regulating body for safety of lorries, buses, horse boxes etc. and a whiz on computers. He lives with his partner of 24. years.My youngest son is married with stepdaughters and their own son who is 23 years.of age. He is an electrician. And is a granddad to 6 boys.I have retired 12 years from an elderly persons residential home	I am the secretary for the Womens' Section of the Royal British Legion (I do find it a bit stuffy) but do enjoy meals and outings with them, so it has to a certain extent broadened my horizon. What I have found in this organisation that there is a lot of bickering and back stabbing - which I find atrocious in that the main aim is to raise enough money to give to HQ for their much needed funds for the soldiers and families of those stricken by the wars in Afghanistan. Syria etc.I have written ever since my children were very small and have had a few articles published. As I get older, I want to record social history more.I still live in a 3-bedroomed house and manage to keep it decorated and would quite happily spend all day in the garden. Have acquired a bichon/poo dog from the dogs trust now nearly 5yrs old who although a challenge in the beginning has opened up the countryside to me and is loved by all.My sons help me out if I go out for a long day, in letting him out when necessary. He's cream and tan cute, frisky, very destructive but everything is kept high and out of reach.~1~SUMMER DIRECTIVE 2020 F.218During Pandemic, I personally missed:I ). Hugs - instantaneous with family and special friends.2). Choir which I have belonged to since 1983. - we are meeting for a catch up in a members garden which bas a wood attached. Not all members are able to come as some work- so we expect 15-20 (normally 36).Unfortunately, we will not be able to sing as its illegal for amateurs. One of our members put a brake on it that she and her sister will not attend!3). Swimming pool. I have high levels of stress and it keeps mind, soul and body synchronised - they are opening since 16th March on 22nd August 2020. One has to go with swimming cossie/trunks. You have to wait outside the building to be allowed in when one shift has f'Inished. (think a sensible thing would be to take forehead temperature like airports) would prove healthier, on the day!4). Womens British Legion. - I am Membership Secretary and have been so for 13 years. In amongst the sometimes boring legislation is, always bearing in mind, the forces folk and families of those with Post Traumatic Stress.They do run coach outings and have Harvest and Christmas suppers. I really am a loner - even more so since this pandemic has crossed everyone's lives - when will we return to freedom.5). Coach trips on a local lad's who had only set up his business 2 years. He tells me he received the Government small business grant and is looking towards running again from 15th October - a mystery trip and other places across East Anglia. This is under strict regulations to have no more than 25 passengers, social distancing6). I m back on buses which have no more than 8 passengers normally, and I get so cross with those who hang masks round their necks or over 1 ear and think that this is OK - yappers from Poland. I had to work very hard toF.218keep my temper in - in fact the only way was to close my ears and dismiss them.7). Talking, drinking, snacking on buses. Impossible as notices on bus windows say its illegal. I do have a nervous continually clearing throat which as it happens I have to sneak a polo into my mouth to keep it lubricated.). Freely walking around shops - feel I am perused everywhere and if there's long queues outside then I move on swiftly so am now doing shopping on way home usually friendly Co-Op.9). I avoided doctors at all costs and haven't visited for nearly a year now and I know that others feel the same way not to pick up Covid. I do have a doctor's appointment and leave a message with reception for doc. to phone me back which she does.10). Sitting in Greggs with bacon and cheese wrap and Belgian bun with coffee. Can only do takeaway which I use as long as there is somewhere outside for me to sit and eat.Rhythm and routine of the day.During the lockdown, apart from walking the dog, I spent a lot of time eating and drinking and watching tv. My eldest son said to me 'We'll get through this together Mum and he and his partner spent much time walking the dog together in the countryside which I very much valued. They also invited me for barbecues which was nice. Both had ended up working from home - my son through having to stay home because of asthma - she worked very long hours keeping her office and team going.I do know that I slowed down a great deal because you couldn't help but take on the seriousness of it all and the implications far reaching out into and from other countries. Days seemed long and deaths in their thousands bringing sorrow and despair.F.218The strangest of all was that there were so few cars on the roads, few people and only post office, newsagents and Super stores open. It was so quiet - you could walk in the road.I did regularly get up in the morning and wondering what day it was because the pattern had changed.Queuing at shops to enter is too extreme as is the sanitising of hands. The other real day to day hardship is toilets - for weeks they were all shut and not much better now.A joy is that the parks are full with families - during this virus, children were indoors all the time. Parents now saying they will miss their children when they go back to school - after six months.Yesterday, Sunday 23rd August I got back to swimming. What joy - what a release- but I found it extremely hard physically. I am now booked in for two sessions and I could use their toilets, lockers and changing rooms - there were only 10 people in each lane. You have to go straight to poolside with your costume/trunks on.So one deep pleasure restored - freedom."

Ours is Blue & is emptied fortnightly- this reminds me of a workman, who, when I offered him tea, said yes, but not fortnight tea because it was too weak. Another asked me why we only have traffic jams & not traffic marmalades.Yes, of course I wash cream & yoghurt cartons (although I make my own yoghurt & bread) & rinse paper that covered our meat before burning it.Bottles, I take to the bottle bank (round the corner) when empty. I love glass & crystal & when my husband died I sent the brass candlesticks & copper kettle to his family & replaced them with glass ashes - not the kettle naturally.I re-used the Bonne Mamon French conserve jars of jams & marmalades because I like the glass size and check lids - red & white & green & white. I use them for whole nutmegs - sugar bowl because of the lid, asam loose tea, hazel nuts, lump sugar, mixed spices, caraway seed, sultanas, cinnamon sticks, soda bread, and my neighbour, who is a real domestic goddess uses my spare jars for jams which she makes from the produce of her allotment. I benefit by being given jellies, jams, homemade scones & sponge cakes. Apart from the jars - I give her glasses of wine and TALK. She calls me the - of Babylon because I am RE while she was a Quaker & her first baby was born in Jerusalem so our notes are signed Jerusalem from her & Babylon from me. I had not realised the family knew this and was amused recently to get a note from her son addressed to A[redacted] Babylon.So that's the story of the jam jars. Garden waste goes into a green bin for which we pay an extra £54 each year. It used to be free (covered by council tax).Yes, I take clothes to a reception point for the homeless. I go by bus since my husband died as I never bothered to learn to drive. Living in London till I came here I did not need to. I detest waste. I grew up on a farm where everything, while plentiful, was re-used - or given to someone. From an early age I remember carrying a gallon of milk to an old man who lived alone. It was usually evening and I remember hearing the bell of the curfew and the mist rising - to this day I love evening & the old man made such a fuss of me saying I was the best 'gearcaile' in the world. He had a sister in America who, when she visited him would sit on the grass to make me daisy chains for a necklace.Yes, today one is motivated by being responsible. In the past I would have discarded pepper seeds, but now if chopped, the birds will eat them.Recycling is now routine.What happens to it = it is used...or am I being naïve??? One hears about the visitor to China who found an envelope put in her recycling bin in England.I have changed my energy supplier to a 'green' agent but someone said that electricity cannot be made green!!!I try not to waste water by using rain water for the garden. If I roast meat, I will roast peppers or cook big potatoes at the same time - all these are obvious - sorry I am not more creative. Have my recycling habit changed in the last year? Yes because there is less shopping, but I do think shops like M&S & John Lewis should use tissue paper to wrap underwear in - its a cop out - paper can be recycled but they have the gall to SELL plastic bags. Why are they still being made? One day SOON I will buy something & before paying will tell them I don't want it if it is not wrapped in paper. P.S I forgot. I recycle envelopes & paper where I can because when I went to school, not just the school books, bill jotters, exercise books, pens and pencils had to be bought by our parents.

Mass-Observer W1835 describes themself as female; widow; pensioner.;The Directive 'COVID-19 and Time' was issued on 7 August 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in relation to the 'rhythm and routine of the day'; 'home life'; use of 'media and technology'; their experiences of 'waiting'.,"W1835Female widow pensioner, Irish living in EAST AngliaSummer Directive Part ICovid 19 & TimeIt is 2.50pm on Thurs Sept. 17th 2020 I have a long story which will go towards explaining why I am so late (even more than usual) in replying.Firstly, in early Feb. I went on a Canary CRuise to get out of not going to a hotel for Christmas with my daughter, her boy friend & friends. I had been the previous Xmas and it was fine but I did NOT want to repeat it or offend her so I used the CRuise as an excuse. Also, because I never learned to drive, I choose the Cruise Co. Saga who send a chauffeur to collect and take me back.It was the 2nd night, one of the 3 when we had to wear evening dress so I flung all 3 on the bed (as you do) & after using one left the others until I got back – which did NOT happen – I knew that 3 girls called “The Opera Girls” were singing Arias so I went straight from dinner to the concert hall to hear them & they finished about 11pm but one of the guests sitting at the dinner table had also W1835come to said another singer was coming to the club so instead of returning to my cabin I went to the club. It was full & I spotted an empty chair and headed for it – But because I was so intent on getting to the empty chair I had not noticed the protruding leg of the chair in front and the toe of my (L) shoe caught on it throwing me forward. Of course several people came to help but I said “No I can manage” doing pilates one is always on the floor. But as I turned, the pain came. It all happened so quickly – I was on a wheel chair being wheeled to the hosp. with ‘Romeo’ clutching my (L) shoe & handbag. I felt Like Cinderella until I was greeted by a sleepy Doctor, wakened up, who growled to the two nurses “put her to bed, Catheterize her to give her morphine. “Romeo” was all for staying – I think he planned on singing to me – but thank God the nurses would not allow him any further. I fell asleep & woke to see a figure approaching – IT was 4am. I must have jumped because he said “I’m just checking you are O.K. IT was the ships doctor from Montenegro, One nurse was from Serbia & the other South African. They Xrayed me which confirmed a fractureW1830I was there for 2 days till we reached the first bit if land which was Maderia. Meantime ‘Romeo’ had been calling 6 times a day & the Serbian nurse would say “your suitor has been again”. I had told them not to let him in so they told him that “only family were allowed”. I think it was the source of much amusement to the DR. & nurses that this (me) bedraggled creature was eliciting such devotion. This is the reason I never go on solo hols. because I don’t want to meet ‘a suitor’ I was very happily married & would always be making comparisons. He had asked me at dinner in front of 8 people how old I was – I said I was not telling him whereupon he replied “It doesn’t matter because I already think you’re Lovely”. His wife had died 18 months ago. The whole table was entertained esp. when he invited me to his home I really wanted to thank him for his help but was afraid to use my mobile because he would know the Tel. No. It’s taught me a lesson to be more distant – my husband used to say that men could misinterpret my friendliness. So the fall was a mercy. and saved me 10 more days of persecution.W1835Arrived at Funchal where an ambulance was waiting to take me to the “Hospital Da Lux” they were all speaking Portuguese and I have not one word.the  surgeon spoke English & asked my weight (for the anaesthethic) – well because I am on statins I am checked once a year at my G. P. clinic I was 58 kilos – 50 – the 8 was in my head and I told them I was 80 kilos. there was silence till the surgeon sad “I think you’ve left some on the ship the ship had gone on to the other islands. I had never returned to my cabin. but saga staff packed and folded everything carefully, jewellery money etc. and all were sent by D. H. L. to my home address securely sealed. The food was simply delicious – 3 cooked meals & afternoon tea with the Portuguese pasta de Nata pastriesThe nurses “bed showered” & washed my hair. BRuno, the physio was a saintThe port medical agent [Duno] had gone to university in England so spoke English visited every day. Dr Pedro the surgeon teased me about wanting a new hip so I decided to fall near beautiful Maderia. He’d been in Dublin on holiday the previous year. One nurse greeted me every morning W1835with ‘Hello, my darling’ that was the extent of her English but when I was leaving even though she was on another unit came & said “May I hug you” goodbye Dr Pedro, Bruno & [Duno] all saw me OFF with kisses on both cheeks. I am not a good patient because I moan if anything hurts – so I bet they were relieved to see the back of me I wanted to give the nurses & assistant nurses some chocolates so [Duno] went shopping for me & even wrote messages on slips of paper & stuck them on the chocs.The most amazing thing of all was my Nationwide Travel Insurance they phoned me every day to chat. They sent a nurse to accompany me home & booked a business class flight to Gatwick with champagne and Returned the cost of my lost holiday. I was telling the nurse about ‘Romeo’ & she said lots of “senior” men take Viagra & their wives were leaving them unable to cope. We arrived home at 1am & the driver did not even have a drink of tea. The nurse was going on to Wales. So I just got home before Covid shut DOWN!P.S.Apropos of the reaction to pain – I think I told you before that in Labour the English are the best & quietest patients, the Irish are the worst with the [?] – All the saints are called on in LOUD VOICES – the West Indians quietly say Jesu, Take this thing out of my belly! I’d be no good as a spy.W1835The Summer Directive Part IAs I said in the introduction I got back from Maderia in time before “shut down” the first couple of weeks were filled with people coming to see me & wanting to hear all about me tripping & sustaining a fracture (and I wasn’t even drunk)March 17ththen one of the ladies reached 90 and had a part in the Golf Club. The band did not turn up because people were beginning to be “careful” but one of those present had a guitar so played I and I was able to dance on my new hip. 14 people did not come & the Club charged PAT, whose birthday it was, for them, including the champagne which we thought mean.The next thing was my trip to Venice and 3 operas in May was cancelled because enough people did not book & “Travel for the Arts”, the company, refunded my deposit when they cancelledAll the shops in the town offered to deliver and the council sent an A4 page of their phone NOS.People continued to visit me but sat in the garden so I brought up a table, parasol & chairs from the cellar.Of course I don’t ask the shops to deliver (except Freshpak who deliver the Kenyan coffee & Assam tea) so I go out.I was slotted in for follow-up checks post op. here and they Xrayed me and saw that I had a cyst on the other hip – it was not bothering then but as time went by it did become painful. I could not go for my usual walks & needed a crutch to just walk for 10 mins.By this time ‘shut down’ had arrived the G. P was doing no referrals & their was a growing back-log in the hospital clinics. I got to the stage where I was not standing I lay on the settee/sofa because my (L) hip hurt if I sat on it – the phone went non-stop &calls from Ireland usually last an hour – so one day 4 hours had gone before I knew it. they were only enquiring about how I was coping with Covid – I did not tell them about the hip & wont till its all over.W1835Because my son’s in China & daughter lives in Italy most of the time, nieces in England phone & one arrived to see me in a camper van which she hired because she would not sleep in the house in case she gave me Covid by chance.The most annoying thing for me is that shops prefer CARDS to cash & I cannot get used to using a card for small amounts and the other change is that I’v become quite lazy & watch old restored films in black & white & [DUB’s] of operas.Some people who called said they knew I was at home because they head the music! I leave the kitchen door ajar & one day I heard a voice calling – so I shouted “come in they called again so I went to see – it was a couple I’d met in Bulgaria a couple of yrs ago, but they would not come in nor have a drink in the garden – so just chatted the other side of the door – I have a half door in the kitchen. The top half has the kind of glass you can see out of but those outside just see a mirror and get a shock when they see themselves. I have it to allow me to watch the birds feeding without disturbing them.Then a miracle happened – The consultant from the Fracture clinic – who took blood to see if there was any infection in the bony cyst, wrote saying there was none but gave me an app. for July. I was so demented by this stage I told him I was willing to pay (although against my principles) whereupon he told me he did not do private patients – for which I admire him He said he would certainly operate but not sure when because of the back-log. So imagine by delight when I got an app for Sept 29th I’v had all the pre-op tests but the ECG showed my heart was racing (Tackycardia) Last week. It will be the electrics & I’ll probably go on beta-blockers but I’ve heard nothing yet – my only hope is that it does not prevent my hip op.Back to Covid! When out shopping we all kept 2 metres apart the street was marked & we went one way going up & returned the other side. Only 2 people went W1835into the shop at once, but unfortunately we began getting lots of visitors who stand around in groups at shop doors – and one has to go in the street to get past them. We all wear masks now. What has Covid done to me?1) Apart from my hip I couldn’t go anywhere, but it did not matter – I dealt with a lot of clutter – did I bin it – NO just moved it somewhere else because it was all too interesting.Friends send books (the house is already full of them). In the house I found Virginia Wolfe, Penelope Fitzgerald.My sleep is back to normal. When my husband died (5 yrs ago) It was disturbed & I slept for only 3-4 hrs a night & as a result felt tired. I’m back to 6 or 7 of really sound sleep now.I haven’t had “spare time” because although visiting has been reduced, people phone, & hours disappear.I am just longing to visit my favourite cities1) London where I lived for 25 yrs2) Dublin (and home in the country)3) Venice (which I love in snow rain, floods & mist.), My husband & I both loved it & visited 26 times and walked & walked to find Artists work in the churches We were going on Easter Monday but he died on the Easter Sunday. I’v been back on my own.Oh yes, I nearly forgot the sky was bluer - & this reflected on the seaIt was lovely to walk through an empty town after 5pm,I’v had to buy sonic alarms because the mice were eating the books on the lower shelves & I was told they would nibble electric wires. Where is that coffee?"

Female, 67, in a civil partnership â€“ living with partner. London. Retired civil servant. Spring Directive 2021 Part 3: The COVID-19 Vaccine If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine I had my first dose of the vaccine at the end of January 2021, which was a bit earlier than I expected. I received a text from my GP surgery and booked an appointment via a link. The appointment was in a GPs surgery within walking distance. It had hastily been made available for vaccine delivery, and I had already seen complaints on social media about its lack of suitability. It was winter, and at this stage in the rollout, the majority of people being vaccinated were elderly and/or vulnerable. The vaccines were administered and delivered on the first floor, and access was via a staircase, or a lift with a capacity, given social distancing, of two people. There was no indoor waiting area, so people had to queue outside in all weathers. The leader of the council arranged for tea and coffee to be given out. The queue wasnâ€™t too long when I arrived and I jumped into the lift, but there were two people already there, one of whom said that we shouldnâ€™t be doing this, so I took the stairs instead. I donâ€™t have mobility issues so that was fine. The reception area was a bit chaotic. At this time, COVID was on the increase and many people hadnâ€™t actually been out of the house for months. The staff and volunteers were trying to maintain social distancing, but a number of people had carers with them and people were wandering back and forth and I remember thinking that it wasnâ€™t at all safe. I saw a woman in a corner who was on oxygen, and felt that it would have been better if she could have been vaccinated at home. The woman who administered the vaccine didnâ€™t introduce herself. She did ask me how I arrived at the centre as she was vaccinating me, possibly to distract me. I had the Oxford vaccine, and didnâ€™t have any particular side effects. We have now moved to a pretty free and easy stage of the process. On 19th July, the government announced that wearing masks was a matter of individual choice. I was rather annoyed about this as I do feel that people need to be told what to do. The virus is still with us, and figures were rising quite rapidly again at that time. Wearing a mask protects the people around you and I felt that sales staff etc still needed to be protected, and was pleased when larger stores and London Transport encouraged people to continue wearing them in store, and on the underground. I have certainly been going out more now that most things are open, but continue to wear a mask in stores and transport, and avoid crowds. Even during lockdown, I went to the supermarket regularly for our own and a neighbourâ€™s shopping, and one day a week to work on a council helpline for the vulnerable. Nothing concerns me about the safety of the vaccine, and I do feel that we are now seeing the benefits as we still have many cases, but they are generally less severe in those who have been vaccinated twice. There will always be exceptions. The vaccine programme Vaccines were initially delivered to the elderly and vulnerable, working through the age groups. I think that it ran fairly smoothly initially for delivery of the first jab. However, I think that people without mobile phones occasionally got forgotten when it was time to get the second. I helped my elderly neighbour get hers as the responsibility for contacting people seemed to pass from GP surgeries to the council, with lots of resulting problems. Personally, I have no complaints as I received a text on both occasions, and was easily able to book an appointment via a link, and received mine eight weeks apart. I volunteer on a local council-run helpline for the elderly and vulnerable and was impressed with how quickly this group were vaccinated, with very few reported problems. Some way into the rollout, once the majority of the vulnerable group had the first jab, the council began to send out messages via social media with details of pop-up clinics. I did note long queues outside the main vaccination centre on several occasions. I have followed the TV news, occasionally tuned into a local council public question and answer session, and read news articles about the vaccine. I have been quite satisfied with the information given. I have spoken on the phone to people who have refused the vaccine, and gather that they have been getting their information via Youtube and social media. A lot of distrust seems to have centred around the speed at which the vaccine developed. Along with this, a tiny percentage of people developed blood clots after receiving the Oxford vaccine, and I have spoken to a number of people in the vulnerable group who believe that, as they already have a medical condition, the vaccine risk would be much greater. Iâ€™ve also spoken to people who believe that Jesus will look after them, so they donâ€™t need the vaccine. Making vaccines mandatory It would be good if vaccines were made mandatory, but Iâ€™m not sure how this could be enforced. I think it is better to encourage, or even incentivise people to get it. I feel that requiring vaccine passports, particularly within UK, would again be difficult to enforce, nor does it mean that you are covid-free. When travelling to certain countries it has long been the case that you have to be vaccinated against diseases such as cholera, typhoid and yellow fever. Maybe covid could be an additional requirement and this may incentivise doubters to get the jab. No-one seems to object to getting their jabs to go on exotic foreign holidays, after all!"

Spring Directive 2021 Part 1: Household Recycling Task From living room: 2 newspapers 2 scratch cards Kitchen: 3 cereal bar cartons 1 glass/plastic pepper mill 1 yogurt pot 1 tin can Bedroom: 1 instruction leaflet for electric toothbrush Recycling at home In the house we recycle items that we think are permissible, according to information that the council sends round periodically, with revisions as necessary, occasionally adding items. I tend to select the items for recycling automatically now, and if I am in doubt about something, I put it in the general waste bin. I am aware at the back of my mind that the council will refuse to take the recycling if they see an item that doesn’t fit the criteria. I don’t usually think much about recycling, but this directive has led me to read my local council’s guidance more closely, and to look at a couple of articles in the press about plastics recycling. According to the press, a lot of plastic, as I suspected, is not recyclable, but my local council seems to be fairly accepting of most items, so I am now confused. Our recycling comprises mainly newspapers and magazines, cardboard packaging, glass, tin cans, plastic containers such as milk and yogurt cartons and toiletries containers. We have a large re-useable bag in the house that we put the items in, and empty it into our outdoor green bin whenever it is getting full. We only have one outdoor bin for recycling, and all of the recycling goes in there without any sorting. We rinse out all food containers, and break down cardboard containers so that they take up less room in the bin. Recycling collections I think we are pretty lucky in my borough as we have a green bin for recycling household items, as above, and it is collected weekly, as is the household waste. I know that a number of other areas have fortnightly collections. We do not have to sort household items any further, and we do have a brown bin for garden and compostable food waste. This is collected fortnightly. I don’t usually find this a problem as I have a fairly small garden. Up until a few years ago, garden waste was collected weekly in summer. The bins have to be placed on the edge of the property to make it easier for the collectors. A leaflet was sent out recently, with photographs to clarify, as we have very little space at the front of the house in many of the properties around here. I must say that I have been very impressed with the level of service we have had in this borough throughout the pandemic, with no missed collections, despite short staffing at times. I know that friends in neighbouring boroughs weren’t so fortunate. I do take books to what are called “little libraries” locally. These are homemade artfully designed wooden boxes outside houses, containing books that can be taken and/or replaced. I found these especially useful during the pandemic when book shops were closed. My tastes are quite wide-ranging so I was quite happy to pick something up that I wouldn’t normally buy. As the boxes are scattered around the area, it also gave me a nice excuse for a walk. The bookshops are open again, but I still take books to the little library. I don’t recycle clothes or shoes. I don’t like clothes shopping and any garments I have I tend to wear to death. Since I retired, I am able to wear casual clothing most of the time, which is a great joy! Why recycle? I have always believed that we should recycle whatever we can. I think my ideas come from my parents who lived through World War Two. My mother, in particular, was a big fan of “make do and mend”. My father was a keen nature lover, and hostile to anything that was likely to harm the environment. I was brought up with these ideas from childhood, and as an adult, believe that it is probably too late to save the planet. Many of us live a comfortable lifestyle that is just not sustainable long-term. Currently, there are targets aimed at reducing car use, and promoting electric cars, beset with problems as people like to have a car, and in rural areas, it is a necessity as public transport is patchy. Electric cars need chargers, the supply of which is, again, patchy. Another target is to replace gas boilers with an alternative, yet to be decided, as nothing seems to work as well. I understand that my recycling is taken to a facility a few miles away and some is made into new products, some is incinerated to produce electricity, and garden waste is turned into compost. This sounds pretty good to me! Every so often, there is a note in the press that it probably doesn’t work quite as smoothly, but I feel that councils are taking recycling more seriously these days. I think that environmental issues are pretty high on the agenda and this will continue as climate change will intensify. Shopping choices I am certainly happier if something I buy is made from recycled materials, or can be recycled, and given the choice, I will choose accordingly. The pandemic has given us much more time at home. We have used some of the time, as have many others, to declutter and tidy the house and, as a result, created more rubbish and recycling. I heard from neighbours that when the charity shops re-opened again after a fairly lengthy lockdown, they weren’t accepting many items, including books, as I think they were a bit overwhelmed."

In the first days of lockdown I feel I adjusted without too much difficulty. It was frustrating as I’d retired in October 2019 and felt I’d got the hang of my new lifestyle and immersed myself in my interests theatre, cinema, travel as well joining walking groups, [U3E] and local wildlife group. However I quickly decided that this was just a ‘phase’ and normality would resume eventually.Like many I fell into a daily routine. Food & the preparation of meals seem to assume a greater importance. For the weekly trip to the Supermarket I made lists of ingredients & had a ‘back-up’ plan if they weren’t available. It has been many years since I did a weekly shop. Fortunately I never encountered long queues. Initially I found the experience of following arrows & keeping my distance quite nerve wracking but I actually prefered a single queue to check-out and ‘paddle’ wielding assistants pointing to the nearest checkout available. I liked the familiarity of the same assistant there every week sanitising my trolley and directing me into the shop. after a few weeks I did get fed up with the same shop & started going to 2. I also started to deviate from my normal route & once drove to the nearest [turn] which looked so empty. I did enjoy the experience of being almost alone on the roadMy husband & I, like many did a daily walk. We are fortunate living in a fairly rural area so no [ineligible] required to get to the walk. We discussed all manner of different routes locally. We are fortunate to live near a river with stunning view. It was also interesting to watch which crops were being harvested & what was [ineligible]. I’m not much of a ‘nature’ person but membership of the local wildlife group means I get emails which include local sightings of all manner of birds and animals including some wonderful photos and videos. I have always been a bit of a news addict, so listened to the ‘daily [ineligible]’. I filled the rest of my days with household chores, reading & some [futive] learn courses. I did make a couple of masks but it took ages – I’m not a sewer and I don’t have a sewing machine. However I was pleased when I could order disposable one’s online.I bought myself a new ‘Kindle’. I don’t have a lap-top but get by with a phone and the new Kindle allows me to do most of what I need to do online. I didn’t do much online shopping, a new iron, steam cleaner and books.I’m not much of a gardener. My husband is responsible for the garden. However I did enjoy sitting out there, reading. I kept in contact with friends & family by ‘phone. We did a ‘whatsapp’ family chat weekly with my daughters. I wasn’t a fan of ‘Zoom’. I did a bit of letter writing. Getting replies in the post was quite exciting. For most of this period in lockdown I felt quite calm & relaxed. My only concerns were for my 94 year old mother, living alone and my daughter alone in a flat in London. The former coped remarkably well due to having very good neighbours. She was offered more help than she needed and received ‘gifts’ left at her door. Her phone rang frequently with people just offering to ‘talk’. However she was lucky in that she has a garden which she still tends to. My daughter worked from home and had plenty to do. Her flat had no balcony but a view of the high street which meant she could see plenty going on. Due to the crowded local parks she took up running again. Her friends kept in touch but occasionally I felt anxious about her.There were certain dates that stood out May 10th. Then ‘unlimited’ exercise & driving out was permitted. We too the 6 mile drive to the coast; it was great. On June 8th the dentist opened and I had an appointment June 21st our family met for a bbq in the garden. I gave them each their own towels & soap to use in the downstairs loo! The first visit to the hairdresser. The downsides – traffic was getting back to normal by the middle of May. By August I’d done my first trip on a train, uneventful & empty carriage. Then a park & ride trip, which was the same. Going to non-essential shops proved a non-event it was a question of grabbing an item and leaving quickly.Somethings have been memorable or just taken on an added enjoyment. We have been to various gardens and I went to the [ineligible] Gallery: Queuing to enter and taking the prescribed route actually added to the enjoyment rather than as I often do wander aimlessly around.The first post lockdown meal out was odd and again a bit scarey, all the visors and ‘help yourself’ to cutlery and drinks from a tray or the end of the table.Throughout the last 6 months life has felt ‘on hold’ but possibly because I’ve not been directly affected by Covid. I have felt time has passed, not more slowly but I’ve just conducted my life at a more leisurely pace. I have not made any plans in terms of holidays, excursions and at the moment live on a day-to-day basis which works for me."

My mum was all for her children having vaccinations as long as they had been tested for long enough to be proved safe, so my siblings and I had all the vaccinations on offer, although sometimes later than first offered. I hadn't had any problems with vaccinations, so in 1968 because I had a heart problem, I was given the new flu jab that nearly killed me. I spent three months in bed and missed a lot of my Lower Sixth schoolwork that I had to catch up later.For this reason I've been wary of new vaccines, but I couldn't wait to get the Covid vaccine! In November 2020 my husband caught a cold. At the end of that week, I started coughing but assumed I'd got it from my husband's cold. But my next symptom was debilitating weakness. I lost all my strength and even getting up to go to the loo was a major effort. I stayed in bed for three days, mostly sleeping. On the fourth day I was far less tired but was now concerned by a pressure in my chest. It wasn't a pain, just pressure. I did what everyone does, I consulted the internet NHS advice and having gone through a series of questions, the advice was CALL AN AMBULANCE. 'Don't be silly,' I thought. I rang my doctor's surgery, explained the situation and the duty doctor said 'We will CALL AN AMBULANCE for you.' Now that frightened both me and my husband.Paramedics arrived ten minutes later and hooked me up to a heart monitor and did a series of tests which also required my to climb the stairs. They were lovely, kind, reassuring young people who chatted away to us while they did their work. In the end, they said they thought that what I experienced probably was Covid, but they had no way of telling. As my tests showed things were largely okay, there was no point in taking me to hospital (relief!) so I should rest for a few days but call them directly if any other symptoms manifested themselves.After my experience I was willing to take any vaccine on offer and I think that goes for everyone I know. Friends, family, neighbours, passing acquaintances, shop keepers were all saying the same thing - give us the vaccine!When the time came for the 70 to 75 year aids to be vaccinated, we booked our appointments online, although that proved to be more difficult than necessary. (We weren't surprised as any computer system the government has anything to do with never functions properly. Our first appointments were on two different days at two different venues about six miles away. The second were on two different days at the same venue about eight miles away. We didn't care, we were just happy to have the appointments.Both my experience and my husband's were good. We drove together to the venues, even though only one of us was being vaccinated, as we were told that we shouldn't drive for ten or fifteen minutes after the vaccine. At the venues we found it was allextremely well-organised and relaxed. We were met by volunteers checking our booking, passed on to admin staff to take medical and other details and then on to a nurse or junior doctor for the jab (Astra-Zeneca in all cases). Waiting times were between fifteen minutes and two and the staff from the Meeters and Greeters to the doctors or nurses administering the vaccine, were most pleasant and efficient.After the first jab, my husband and I didn't feel quite right for about 24 hours after it, but that was all. We had no reaction to the second jabs at all. My sister, daughter and neighbours had flu-like symptoms with headaches and feverishness that lasted 24 hours. My brother-in-law was fine, but his brother who was seriously ill with Covid last year and suffers from Long Covid, was really poorly for a couple of days. It does seem to be a very individual response.The vaccine programmeThe rollout by the NHS in our area was done well. We began to notice when friends who are over 80 started receiving invitations for vaccines, but as the vaccination clinics were large and not very local, they needed someone to give them lifts. Most managed this, but we wondered how other people without support were managing.Some doctors' surgeries were also very good at contacting patients and offering vaccination appointments. Not so ours. It was impossible to contact the surgery and there was absolutely no mention of Covid at all on their website. When the vaccinations of over-70s was announced, we booked online via the NHS. The appointments weren't very convenient, but we were keen to get this going. Then a couple of days later, our surgery rang to invite us for the vaccine, but by then it was too late.In the meantime, we weren't very impressed with the coverage by newspapers and the media. On the one hand people were being told to go and get the vaccine when offered it and on the other were being scared off by tales of blood clot problems in immensely small numbers of people across the world. Our shocking death rate should have been enough to send everyone rushing for the vaccine regardless of risk. Covid is vile and merciless and I think the best mantra has been 'No-one is safe until we are all safe'. People need to get vaccinated for the sake of others as well as themselves.Of course, we were beset by the anti-vax brigade who believed all the utter made-up drivel about the virus on the internet. Even our plumber said he wasn't getting vaccinated because he wasn't letting the government put a chip in him! I know him well enough to tell him not to be so stupid - there is no such technology you could put into a syringe. I haven't seen him to ask him about whether he's had the vaccine yet, but I will be checking up on him.I was extremely angry to hear that many doctors, nurses and carers hadn't been vaccinated and that teachers were not on the priority list. I have written many letters to my MP in the past year (and he does always reply) but this situation with teachers made me rage. My daughter has taught many lessons on line over the last year, but as soon as the schools opened up on March 8, she was facing on some days 150 students. The government kept saying that teachers don't have any more risk ofW1813getting Covid than anyone else, as if it didn't matter if they caught it. Twice since then my daughter has had to quarantine with her husband and children because she'd been in contact with a child that tested positive. It is very stressful having to wait to see if Covid develops or knowing you might be bringing it home to your family.Keeping to the RulesWe have kept to most of the rules for most of the pandemic, but sometimes it has made life difficult. We saw my daughter and her family during the October half term holiday and arranged to meet again for the exchange of Christmas presents. It turned out to be the day Boris Johnson chose to belatedly lockdown the country for the second time. I wished later that I had broken the rules that day because our grandchildren didn't get their presents until the next half term, and only then because we did break the rules. My husband and I had both had the first vaccine and we hadn't been anywhere (except my weekly visit to the supermarket). Our daughter and her husband were being tested for Covid twice a week and apart from to their jobs and the supermarket, they hadn't been anywhere either. We reckoned our grandchildren would not be a risk and in any case, we needed to see them.At March half term, we met our daughter and her family outdoors at a National Trust house in Oxfordshire. We took a picnic and had a lovely day together (and yes, we did hug). We brought our ten year old grandson home with us for four days of football (I had the bruises to prove it), baking bread and playing video games. We had an outdoor meeting with my sister too before we returned him to his parents. It was such a joy to spend time with him after five months. We regularly Zoom, but it's not the same.By the end of April, I had had my second jab and my daughter and her husband had continued to be tested regularly so we chose to break the rules again. It was my daughter's 40th birthday at the start of May, so she had booked a National Trust cottage in Shropshire and had invited us to join her if we wanted to. The very thought that we wouldn't! I made a birthday cake, bought gifts, balloons, toys, food and drink. More food and drink arrived with my daughter along with her husband and our two grandchildren and we had a wonderful weekend.Mostly we still follow the rules. We still mainly stay at home except for walks around the village. We wear masks when meeting strangers and frequently use antiseptic hand gel after meetings. There are fully vaccinated friends I will now visit indoors, but I am reluctant to go to pubs and restaurants as it seems the virus, especially the Indian variant, is spreading. We are booked to visit Edinburgh and some friends in July, but as it's been for the last years nothing is certain. We also have a holiday booked in Iceland in the summer and Portugal in the Autumn, but again, we shall just have to wait to see what happens.Making vaccinations mandatoryI find it very difficult indeed to understand why people are reluctant to get vaccinated, although I have to say that I do like vaccines to have be thoroughly tested before they come anywhere near me. By the time the Astra-Zeneca vaccine was offered to me, I reckoned it had been tested on sufficient numbers to suggest it was safe.There are people who cannot take vaccines for authentic medical reasons, but I get very annoyed with people who won't have the vaccine. Sometimes it's just not understanding the situation. Some neighbours had a very elderly father living with them and he refused to get the vaccine because he said he didn't go anywhere (which was true). His daughter tried to explain that he was at risk from her and her husband because they did go shopping and out for other reasons. In the end he became ill (not with Covid) and was admitted to hospital. He wasn't vaccinated there despite the risks, but when he was admitted later to a nursing home, they insisted on the vaccine.People talk about their 'right' not to have a vaccine, but what about the rights of those they could infect through contracting Covid? It's utter selfishness. I do think that it should be mandatory for those who work in the public services - carers, doctors, nurses, paramedics, domestic workers, teachers and anyone else who comes into contact with lots of people - to be vaccinated. But then I also think that it ought to be compulsory for children to have had all the necessary vaccines before they start nursery or playschool. It is not only about the rights of individuals but about the responsibility of everyone to keep everyone else safe.I wrote to my MP recently to express my horror at finding that paramedics who visit the care home where my very elderly father lives, not only have not had the vaccine, but are not even tested. Everyone in the care home - residents, carers, office staff, cleaners, cooks, gardeners - have been vaccinated and I cannot praise highly enough the effort the home has gone to in keeping our relatives safe through such dark times. But when paramedics arrived recently to attend to a patient, the manager casually enquired how often they got tested to be told that they don't. Unbelievable! So yes, compulsory vaccinations should be introduced."

B4290, married, 52, Cambridgeshire, public sector, March 2022.Covid-19 at the time of writing (March 2022) is still with us. The numbers of hospital in-patients at Addenbrookes are low these day: c.40 but plenty of people are still catching the latest strain - Omicron. One of our chums came down with it yesterday and is a schoolteacher in a secondary school in Essex. If you are triple-jabbed with no known or unknown pre-existing medical conditions, then you have a high chance of surviving. Long Covid is still affecting people, but the virus is, at the time of writing I should say, is doing what most viruses do: mutating to more transmissible, but less lethal strains. It does not want to wholesale kill off its hosts. Our next-door neighbours caught Omicron over Xmas but ten days later they were all back on their feet again. Their cousin, by contrast, caught the Delta variant in Spring 2021 and ten days later he was dead.My peculiar in-laws failed to abide by lock-down rules and have treated the pandemic as a personal affront to their liberty.Returning to work and normalityI have worked all through the pandemic, both when living in West Suffolk and now in East Cambridgeshire, commuting into Cambridge. My current post had already been altered for home-working so I now have a choice of home working or a hybrid roster with my two other office colleagues.On the days when I go into the office using my bike on the train, I still wear a mask, but the vast majority of people are not. I would not mind so much but modern trains do not have openable windows to assist with ventilation. Air-conditioning systems just spread germs around the carriages, so I often open the doors at intervening stations just to get some air into carriages. Rising energy billsElectricity and gas were never a concern for my parents in the 1960s or '70s or for me when I ran my flat in the 1980s and 90s. but how this has changed since privatisation. Luckily, we left out last fuel company before it went bust and set a fixed tariff with our new company but this is not guarantee of longer-term assurance. And what about those who could not afford to negotiate or change in time? I resent all the time we have to spend just finding a (functioning) fuel company: again, something we didn't need to do in years gone by. Martin Lewis, the money-saving-expert, recently said that unless Government steps in this year we shall see absolute (now relative) poverty arriving at the doorsteps of many lower-paid and fixed income households. After twelve years of Tory Governments this, sadly, does not come as a surprise to me. The Tories look out for themselves and their mates in big business and seem to have a punishment agenda for the rest of us. I find it utterly astonishing that people who notice all these declines in their standards of living still vote Tory. The Poppy Centenary. Mixed feelings about this. The Nazis had to be stopped and we ought to be thankful to the PBIs (Poor Bloody Infantry), but we seem to throw our weight around the world on the flimsiest pretences now. Anyway, the wounded need to be cared for so I put the money in the pot but no longer wear a poppy.David Amess, despite him being an anti-choice Tory, appeared to a good constituency MPs. His extremist Catholic stance made him in my eyes a religious nutcase, but he didn't deserve to be killed by another religious nutcase.Prince AndrewThis man has no moral compass, yet according to Private Eye's reports he still believes he can be rehabilitated to full strength royal duties. More worryingly there are silly people out there who believe that he should. Charity work is his only hope now, providing it is sincerely executed. I'm no raving monarchist but we do pay for this family which gives me a right of reply. I think the monarchy ought to be slimmed down to 'One Spouse and One House'.Owen Patterson broke the rules and got caught but Boris tried to get the rules changed in order to keep his mate in Parliament. No surprise from the man who prorogued Parliament in 2019 because it wasn't working for him them either. Perhaps Boris thinks he's Charles the First. Perhaps he hasn't thought that analogy through. Enoch Powell (of all people) said that all political careers end in failure and this thought keeps me going when I watch the present shambles. Home Secretary Priti Patel is trying to pass a Police and Crime Bill to severely restrict UK citizens' rights to protest whilst simultaneously supporting Ukrainian citizens' right to protest..."

My parents were responsible for my health and wellbeing. My father was and is a great believer in the health benefits of walking. My mother neglected my health and general care in my early years and this was picked up on by the school dentist and at least one GP.I also learned about health by reading Yoga leaflets and books, NHS leaflets, teen magazines, library books, newspapers and monitoring how my body felt when I took exercise, or didn't.Key momentsMy puberty spanned ages 11 to 14. I didn't treat the events as rituals or terribly important, indeed, they added to the general faff of life at the beginning of the GCE O-Level courses.My mother disclosed details to others, which I did not appreciate and I made this known.Growing older1,	Since the age of five I've been as active as my health and work have allowed me to be. This has included bicycling since age six (from 1976 to the present day), ballet from age five to 14, Yoga from age seven to the present, walking/hiking as often as possible, and from earlier than I can remember, swimming. I'm waiting to get back into the water at time of writing, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Pools, rivers and the sea here in the UK: any of them would do right now. Information about health and wellbeing now comes from newspapers, books, the internet, posters and leaflets, health food shops, NHS Consultants and Functional Medicine practitioners, particularly the latter in recent years. I'm more aware of my body now but this is due to having to rely on it to get me to and from work If you choose not to run a car, you have to run your body instead, and run it as well as possible.Health, well-being and appearanceSkin, hair and over or under weight soon reflect poor health. I'm not too bothered about popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance if they relate to fashion, social media etc. I've enjoyed wearing even less make­ up this last year during the Covid lockdowns and am wearing less now that I am back at work, at a different job. Perhaps my parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals. There seemed to be a direct link between marriageability and personal grooming/looks amongst certain classes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly for women. A pleasant-looking doll to come home to? Modern social media may exert similar pressures, but I didn't feel that my marriage prospects or job prospects depended on these things myself.Desert Island health and wellbeing items:Bicycle, swimming costumes, Yoga mat and back roller, free weights, clean drinking water, a firm bed for sleep, walking and hiking boots and shoes, and a moisturiser from the health food shop.Getting ready to leave the house:I have more memories of my parents arriving home than leaving. Their work changed whilst I was growing up and so did their routines. Mine have changed likewise. Over time it has consisted of breakfast, showering, dressing, miscellaneous preparation such as bags, kit etc. Then cycling, walking, train, or a combination of all three. I made a personal promise not to buy a car of my own for as long as possible, to safeguard my health. I've kept this promise thus far at age 51. I'd like to cycle to work right up to my retirement, and beyond, if I can. The thought of having to drive to work does nothing for me and it will do nothing for my health either."

The first gave me violent headaches, I thought I would have a stroke! My head hurt, eyes etc and that lasted for over 5 wks. My 2nd was  on 25 April 2021 and within 6hrs I had arthritis in all my joins - the pain - that lasted again nearly 6wks. So when the authorities said we had to have a booster - my heart sank and I thought I'd rather not. Both my husband and 96yr mother-in-law had the Pfizer with no after effects, and I'm sure they thought I was a 'wimp' - after a visit to see my doctor, she told me the N.H.S was trying to get in touch and I should book a booster - so I did. It was due 3rd Dec. (so I could be nearly OK for Christmas). When I went up to Buxton chemist for appointment. The pharmacist said did I have any problems - so told him and he said he though I was allergic to vacc - he couldn't give me the moderna vacc- as there was no doctor on site he could give no adrenelin and he had no bed. (just in case). So I said, (as he was good looking) could you give me the kiss of life? Not today he replied!So I rang 111 again - booked in on 6 Dec. again at chemist. Although I'd said I need a DR present, I turned up and nurse on duty asked if I had any problems, I told her my problem and she said her sister was the same and ended up at an allergy clinic - I had to go straight back to my doctor. So I did! Who advised me to take anti-histamines before I had the vaccine. I was singing at our local stately home with community choir the Saturday 18th Dec. from 11 onwards so they said to turn up 9.30amd my own doctor was there and he administered my vacc. Just felt light-headed for a couple of hours - but I managed to sing and touch wood there were no reactions - fantastic!! It was the Pfizer one. RestrictionsUp to now these haven't really impinged on our way of life.We had a Christmas lunch party at our local community centre - in our pods - socially distanced, masked until seated, sanitised hands - it went well. We had an art society Christmas lunch again masked till seated - etc - it worked well.Midnight mass - singing with masks on is no joke - but to meet up again and celebrate the wonderful festival was uplifting -  one of the wardens sanitised where we were sitting as we left. The new norm.Testing 2 days or 1 day before leaving for holidays abroad must be the price to pay to stay safe and to quarantine for a few days when returning and taking the tests must now be the new normal to keep us all safe.I'm sure its similar to the recorded precautions of the Plague and Black Death - all those centuries ago - History repeats itself. For New Years its different regulations for England, Scotland, N.Ireland, Wales. Rising Energy Bills and companies going bust.What happened to the old fashioned Gasometers.Gas works factories, coke plants???Are we being forced to go nuclear!Our homes are designed for gas/electric central heating how can they be cheaply converted?I remember the 3 day week. We worried about the gas being turned off - gas leaks etc.What happened to North Sea gas and the gas layers under the sea beds?Is this current situation being driven by a greedy Russian state? Its asking for trouble as the pipeline goes through many countries.Its the little companys that are going bust as they have no collateral behind them.I can imagine we will all have 6.6.9s and candles - God help the fire service.When will it end?Centenary of the Red Poppy.We must never forget the great sacrifice our soldiers, armed forces made for us. They died so we might live !!!Nowadays we are living through the after effects of breaking away from Europe. Our turn to stand up for ourselves. We can do it - despite the spite of Germany and France - I cannot believe in this day of the 21st century that Europe is making it so hard and holding us up as an example so that other countries will be part of pulling out of the agreement. What sort of Europe is being developed - What will they do next? Do we trust them??There have been no actual wars, but there has been genocide (Hungary etc) in Europe and in other parts of the world - and it must be monitored and stopped - (its going on in China still). We must wear our poppy with great pride. The murder of Sir David AmessThis has thrown up security problems of prominent figures. Two years ago there was the murder of the Yorkshire Labour female M.P. Anne? Her sister has taken her place in Parliament - they never seem to learn, or take advice. We live in such diverse times - in different cultures - ethics - consciences meet in our country - I'm sure the security forces work very hard to sift out subversive elements but obviously the determined get through the net. The terrorist elements seems to find different routes to enter our communities - the latest one - Iraqi- supposed to have converted to Christianity to claim asylum here - blew himself up last Remembrance Day - the taxi driver was lucky to get out alive. As young children we were always told to 'beware of strangers' - then there was the racist card - but surely safety of our country comes first.The conduct of MP. Owen Paterson (resigned) and Governments U Turn.How suspect !! How devious !! How untrustworthy!! How hypocritical!! How shallow!!We all know those in power just 'line their nests' - before they 'work' for the country.It is a career with M.Ps - they forget they have a 4/5 year span - with luck they will be voted in again - it's not supposed to be a job for life!! And yet it seems to be. It seems if someone 'bends' the rules - 'misinterprets' the rules - 'gets caught' - the rules can be changed (where is the opposition! Where is the 'openess', 'clarity', 'Queen's English'-) to suit the circumstances.Those in government must realise they live in 'glasshouses' - someone somewhere knows. They must be accountable to the electorate. The lawsuit involving HRH Prince AndrewWell, what can you say!!Its laughable that he thinks he can 'get away with it'!As I write this, Ghislaine Maxwell has been sentenced for life (40yrs) for trafficking young vulnerable girls 14yrs-17yrs for sexual pleasures. She has been photographed many times with the Prince. Such links will be damning for him. It is sordid and grubby and unwholesome.Our Royal family seems to be following the footsteps of past Royals - but this time in public. This leads me to think of Prince Harry (does he still want to use this title?) and his wife, or rather not think of them. They are cashing in on their name, Sussex, I'm sure rue the day that the pair were named after their county. Prince Charles also has a P.R problem - one of his aides has been using his position to gain knighthoods etc for cash.Such goings on behind closed doors. Despite the unsettled times (covid, omicron etc) behaviour of our Royal family, the government, policeforce - we still have one of the most desirable countries to live in. We know that because people risk their lives and some have given their lives to get to live in our country. God bless the N.H.S + essential services.Now the N.H.S are building Nightingale Units to recuperate covid patients after treatment. There are 5 to be built with provision for 100 beds in each. (what happened to those they built earlier?)Apparently there is an area in Australia that is covid free - it has closed its borders to the rest of the country - I think its around Perth. Melbourne has had a few lockdowns so far. Our daughter-in-law has tested positive in Italy so the family had to come back - leaving mum with her parents in Italy. My husband had to take their car to the airport (I packed children a picnic hamper) so he came back home on the bus - and the family (dad + 2 girls) went to a drive through covid check, possibly a 2hr wait for them! Luckily I've 2 test kits here (they are difficult to get hold of!) so they can test while isolating for a few days.'I wish you all a happy, peaceful and healthy 2022'. SLR."

I know our benches on the canal are made of recycled plastic (it says so on label!). I hope good use is made of what is collected. Rubber tyres should be made into road surfaces(in 21st century we should have streamlined transport!

Retired male train driver, married, living in Basildon aged 67. The Covid-19 vaccine I have had one dose of the vaccine. It was the Pfizer one and I had it on the 25th Feb. My second is due on the 12th May. I think that the vaccine is the only part of the whole virus story that the government has got right. I would have had the Oxford vaccine if that had been offered but it wasnâ€™t. I think that the risks are so small that they are not worth worrying about. After I had the jab I had a stiff arm for a couple of days but that was all. I think I have heard people say that side effects of the second jab are more because the body will have built up a level of antibodies which will react against the vaccine. Itâ€™s interesting that when the health concerns were raised the BBC stopped calling it the â€˜Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccineâ€™ and just started referring to it as â€˜the Astra Zeneca vaccineâ€™. On the day I had my dose I went to the Towngate Theatre here in Basildon which hasnâ€™t been used as a theatre for more than a year and has been converted to a vaccination centre at the rear and a testing centre at the front. There was a steady stream of people turning up for the injections and I was very encouraged by this. On the news the day before the BBC had filmed a vaccination centre in Belgium where they can cope with two thousand people per day. It was empty because of high levels of distrust surrounding the Astra Zeneca vaccine. This has rebounded because Belgium and France are now deep into a third wave of the disease. I feel very sorry for all the people who have died, no matter where they are. My wife wonâ€™t have the vaccine. She is very keen on alternative medicine and says none of the vaccines have been tested rigorously enough. We are due to go on holiday to Greece in September if that is allowed. Half-jokingly I said to her that I might be allowed to go and she might not which didnâ€™t please her. There is a serious point to all this in that if most people have gone to the trouble of isolating and then getting vaccinated then itâ€™s not fair to expect them to get on a plane with loads of untreated people who might be carrying coronavirus. I am in favour of vaccine passports. I would never tell my wife that she should have the jab though because it has to be left up to the individual."

However, I have actually enjoyed having more time as a couple as, I particularly, do not have as many events to attend. My husband too usually has events such as his twice weekly visit to the charity he helps at.We have lost the idea, a little, of following a routine and so, just as this morning, if I am enjoying reading a book I don't need to rush to get up. However, we are usually up and about quite early in the mornings. Our lives don't appear to have either sped up or slowed down but it is more about our activities that we have carried out during this 'Lock Down' time. Interestingly apart from both of us, on occasional days when we felt unmotivated to get on with things, this 'Lock Down' has been a time when we've had our house on the market, found a buyer and a new property, although at the time of writing we have not moved Because we are moving from a 4 bedroom house to an apartment with only two bedrooms so a great deal of our time is taken up with a lot of downsizing and my husband is an excellent person to be in such a scenario with! He learned how to sell one-bay and has literally 'downsized.' Our kitchen table is now an 'island' table, a chest of drawers which once had a wardrobe on its top now doesn't a three drawer unit is now a two drawer unit and a bookcase has been reduced by a couple of inches in order to fit in the apartment. We have reduced the contents of our home by several thousand pounds.We haven't really taken up new hobbies, apart from T having done quite a lot of mosaic work using a kit he bought several years ago at a jumble sale and then buying more in order to do nine door pictures for our daughter's school classrooms. I had some handmade patchwork I'd done, not knowing at all what I intended to use it for; we've ended up re-covering my needlework box. T has painted and decorated our ottoman which has become my craft box. We've both always enjoyed crafting and making things and near the start of Lock Down I did what I called my Coved embroidery, embroidering pictures of things I saw as Coved related. Over the months I've sewn bags for scrubs, masks and knitted mask holders. I've made a Christmas snowman and am now working on sewing and beading a Christmas stocking, whilst T has been repairing a pirate ship for M's class.We have also done more walking during Lock Down discovering a lovely walk; in all our 24 years living here we had never been on before. I bought myself a weighted hoop and learned to do it, with advice from our granddaughter who is very good at it.One good thing which has come out of this pandemic has been that I've become more confident in driving T's car; my car having been in the garage the Friday before Lock Down waiting for parts to repair its axel - a problem they've never seen before!!!We've learned how to go on zoom because our church hasn't been able to meet; but it's more difficult for us as we normally meet in a school. I don't really envisage myself continuing to use it once, if ever, things are sorted. However, just as I'm typing this I am thinking in the winter when people are unable to get out due to weather, meetings may still be able to be held. I'm actually 11fed up' with zoom now but can't fail to be grateful for all the work which has gone into making it work for the church.I've missed two hospital appointments just 11check-ups' for my heart but I'm not worried at this stage anyway as they were becoming more spaced apart as the years have gone on.Early on in the Lock Down I developed a rash on my arm which thenTl qk> \photographs. She gave me a prescription. Thad an appointment with his cancer specialist which was ok as all the results from his blood test had been entered onto the computer.We have learned to queue before going into shops but have patronised our village shop which has been absolutely amazing. We try to avoid visiting the larger shops, cutting down our visits.We do have a 11sort of' routine but it doesn't differ too much fromthat which we had pre-Coved. One thing which we enjoy is that lunch times which previously would often be rushed or 'fitted in' because either I'm out or T is doing his voluntary but now we have the time to eat together which is nice. We had started walking more at the beginning of 'Lock Down' but that has 'tailed off' a bit now after so many months although we do go on a walk sometimes still. One bit of a new routine is that most afternoons now later, before tea we sit and play Scrabble. Otherwise we consider ourselves very lucky as retired people to be able to 'please ourselves.' We have no one else in our house we are 'in synch' as much as ever for a couple who have been married Slyears.Our lives are due to change very much even despite Coved 19 since we are moving to a Retirement Village with all that entails; but I'm very sure too there are going to be many, many changes which will affect everyone after this Pandemic."

Retired Civil Servant All our immediate family are double vaccinated. I know that does not mean one cannot catch the virus, or unknowingly infect others, but we have never been asked to take any test. I confess I did not know there were so many different types of tests. It is presumably organised by our GP surgery. We are fortunate to live in an uncrowded area and being retired we have little need to come into contact with others. If we meet friends or neighbours, it is out of doors, or in well ventilated places. I have always avoided crowded places and I shop very early in the day if I can. If I need to go into Bath (our nearest town centre), I catch the first available Park & Ride bus, which has only a fraction the number of passengers compared to pre-pandemic days, and I am returning home at the time most people are arriving.  I always wear a mask when required (though not out in the open) and use every hand-sanitizer point available in stores or the library. Catching the ‘bug’ or infecting other people does not feature much in my thoughts. I have never caught ‘flu, or any other infection since I retired from work and usually remember to wash my hands when returning home as a matter of course. One part of the Park & Ride Car Park has been set aside for testing, and a number of volunteer staff are generally standing around in hi-vis jackets waiting for ‘customers’ when I drive in to park. I hope they feel their time is well spent. I expect they have more people later in the day. Every day we read or hear ‘the latest Covid figures’ in the local news. When the figures are rising my husband’s reaction is ‘doom and gloom’. But surely these figures are just the number of positive test results? These people are not necessarily sick. They may be asymptomatic or at worst, just experiencing something like the ‘flu. Giving out the figures every day is no longer frightening those who decline to be vaccinated. At the same time it causes undue anxiety in the hypercondriacs (not sure how to spell this) and the naturally nervous. The more tests you carry out, the more positive ‘hits’ you will get. That is mathematical logic. It should not be influencing political decisions. The figures for hospital admissions are a far better indicator of how serious the current situation. If anyone testing positive is required to self isolate, that gives some protection to all those who are especially vulnerable. I feel very sorry for those who are clinically vulnerable, who have had a very worrying time. However, I feel that requiring all contacts to be ‘pinged’ and to self-isolate for a week is causing unjustified disruption to everyday life. Even in Bath library, I overheard a librarian talk of the problems this was causing them. It results in far greater problems occurring in other areas and frustration for those needing attention for unrelated, serious medical conditions. It has even brought about the cancellation of India’s Fifth and Final Cricket Test Match!! Anyway, like a significant minority of the population, I do not have a smartphone and have no intention of getting one. I am sorry my response to this Directive is rather negative and unhelpful."

In previous years, our names have â€˜fallen through the cracksâ€™ for â€˜flu vaccination and we missed out. We were relieved to be offered a date in late December, at 6 pm, in Shepton Mallet, some 20 miles away. Although our address is â€˜Bathâ€™, our doctorâ€™s surgery is just over the county boundary in Somerset. I would happily have driven in daylight, but I find dark roads at night a problem, with dazzle from other vehicles. I would not let my husband drive for the same reason, but fortunately, our elder son was able to take us. It was a beautiful evening, quite mild for December, with a full moon. When we arrived at some municipal office buildings â€“ we never did find out their normal use â€“ we were surprised to find some of our neighbours in the queue. Our doctor must have been allocated a block booking. In fact there were two other members of our art group -we joked about having a drawing class while we waited! It was almost a party atmosphere, with a cheerful group of volunteers in charge. They were a bit disorganised. When we were called forward, my husband had to point out that another lady had been waiting longer. There were, I think, four doctors, practising or retired (?) each with a nurse wielding the needle. Anyway, he and I went in together and it was soon done (the Pfizer vaccine). We had stickers put on our shoulders with the time written on so they could ensure we waited for the stipulated 15 minutes. No ill effects (nor did we expect any), and we were home by eight. We were given an appointment for the second dose in January, and my husband was very annoyed when it was decided to postpone it so that the jabs could instead be given to the next eligible age group.  However, thinking about it, I said it was to everybodyâ€™s benefit if more people could be given a first jab, if it stopped the spread. Actually, I think the benefit is overestimated, because it does not stop you getting the virus, or infecting others if you do. It just makes the effects less serious. Nevertheless, we waited anxiously to be given a second appointment, which was in March, and in daylight this time. We managed to get lost in the town, arriving in a car park with NHS banners and a reception group of marshals who, it turned out, were the Covid Test team. They had no idea where the vaccination centre was and could not direct us. Fortunately we had allowed plenty of time and found the right place, the same place as the last time though they had re-organised it a bit. A chatty group of local people soon joined the queue. They seemed to have been brought in a minibus whose driver also got lost in the town! We came home â€˜the pretty wayâ€™ and stopped for a picnic. Again, no ill effects apart from the expected stiff shoulder. Our elder son, 61, had a first dose of the Astra Zenica vaccine the same week at the West of England Show Ground, in the Somerset Cider Pavilion (but no cider!). It was well signposted, with plenty of space for parking. His brother, 59, also had his (Astra Zenica) the same week in Bath. He lives near us, but is disabled (mobility problems) and our very understanding doctor advised him some time ago to transfer to a Bath surgery. It has to be said, the Bath authority is better organised, perhaps because it is a more centralised area. Neither son had any problems. P1326 My husbandâ€™s cousins, living in the W Midlands were ill after their jabs, but those two always seem to have health problems, picking up un-named bugs. A retired colleague of my husband living in South Wales, in the Valleys, was also ill with a high temperature after his AZ jab. He has a heart pacemaker and other health problems. His doctorâ€™s receptionist refused to arrange a home visit until confronted by his very angry daughter. (Believe me, Welsh daughters can be formidable!). The doctor called and diagnosed â€˜old fashioned â€˜fluâ€™! Before the virus hit us, we found it surprising to see oriental people (Japanese?) on TV meekly wearing masks whenever they were out. Now we have become accustomed to them too and expect to continue for some time. It makes me cross to see discarded masks in say, supermarket car parks (perhaps dropped accidentally) but also on the roadside verges, clearly thrown out deliberately. I went in to town on April 13, the second day after the lockdown was eased for non-essential shops. There were crowds everywhere, although most people were careful about social distancing. Where ever there was space there were tables and people eating out in the sunshine (it was lunchtime). There were also queues of men outside barber shops. I had a routine dental appointment and I found hard pavements made my feet sore after walking on grass and footpaths for so long. The dentistâ€™s waiting room was still closed and we had to stand outside on the pavement and phone in. Luckily it is a quiet Georgian street and I did not have to wait long. The expected routine â€“â€˜hand sanitiser, leave your coat and bag in a closed boxâ€™. My only shopping was a box of superior chocolates to share with the family after Sunday lunch â€“ something we have missed. I noted other useful shops now open. The bus each way was the Park and Ride, with just a few passengers, all wearing masks. We have a popular footpath through woods near us with a convenient parking area, but it has become horribly crowded over recent months. Competition for parking space, cars spilling onto the road (it is amazing there have not been any accidents). Dog fights and increased litter. Suddenly this week, in spite of beautiful weather, it has become very quiet. They must have all gone shopping! As I write this, I can see a hot air balloon sailing along, just over the skyline â€“ something we have not seen for a long time. I have mixed thoughts about the vaccination passport proposal and to be honest I have not followed the arguments. At present, it would penalise all those who were not yet eligible. Whether it is right to force individuals to be vaccinated I am not sure. It is not an absolute human right to be able to go into a pub, or to travel abroad. We have a choice. However, not being vaccinated becomes a threat to others with whom we would inevitably come into contact. We can all accept that a jab for malaria or yellow fever is necessary for travel to specified countries, so why the controversy over Covid protection? Hopefully we will soon have herd immunity anyway. In the meantime I have absolutely no wish to go abroad, although I can sympathise with frustration of others. Today (April21) I have had a much needed haircut. My hairdresser, in her early 50s, also got lost trying to find the right vaccination centre in Shepton Mallet!"

P1326 Female, aged 82, married, living with husband and one son in a rural location near Bath. Retired Civil Servant COVID-19 First of all, there have been a number of comparisons of the current crisis to 1939. Well, my early childhood memories of wartime London are pretty different. It was grey and drab and cold with lots of bombed out buildings. The food was pretty unappetising too. Not a bit like today, and it lasted a lot longer. People lived with the dread prospect of Nazi troops taking over the country. I have never much liked China and its culture. We meet individual Chinese people here, and they are nice people, many highly educated. Their science goes back way further than Western science. It is their Communist leaders with their inhumane treatment of minorities and dissidents, their cruel treatment of animals, their wretched ‘wet markets’ and their ‘traditional medicine’ using animal parts like rhino horn, and pangolins being driven to extinction for discredited scientific reasons. Neighbouring people in eastern Asia, like Tibet, have to struggle against their domination, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Through my elder son, ES, we have had direct links with Mongolia and have met and entertained visiting academics. The Mongolians can co-operate with their Russian neighbours. They have links with several European countries, but the Chinese they simply do not trust. They have not trusted them since before the time of Genghis Khan. India too is dealing with armed Chinese incursion over its NE frontier in Ladakh and unarmed Indian soldiers killed. With their repressive Communist regime, the Chinese could easily abolish wet markets that have been responsible for previous pandemics. Instead, they tried to suppress the news of the outbreak. It is now suggested the virus originated from an experimental laboratory near Wuhan. Difficult to prove of course, but back in 2018, there were fears about the bio-security of the lab in question. True to their nature, the Chinese government are trying to put the blame on others like the Americans and have convinced their own people. In my opinion, the Chinese regime is despicable. They should be made to pay for the damage they have caused to people’s lives across the world. There was a letter recently in the paper from a couple who had lived in China up until a decade or so ago, and had found the people reasonably friendly and easy to deal with. It was only when Xi Jinping came to power that the worst repression, and the international aggression really started. On the subject of ‘wet markets’ a recent letter in the paper pointed out that in countries where rural areas have no electricity for refrigeration (eg for many Africans) wet markets were essential, but I do not imagine that applies in Wuhan. There are always two sides to an argument, I suppose. Anyway, having got that off, a report of our experiences will, I am sorry, be disjointed. One of the first news items was of passengers confined to their cabins on some world-wide cruise ships and I am afraid I felt very little sympathy. However, in a similar situation a couple of years ago, involving an epidemic on another cruise ship, I expressed similar sentiments, and was gently rebuked by a friend (no more able to afford a cruise than us). She said there would be some passengers on that ship who had saved for years for the ‘trip of a lifetime’, which had then been ruined. She was right of course. I still would not choose a cruise liner to see the world even if I could. The first indication here was when the attendant at our local petrol station handed my husband B a whole box of disposable gloves ‘for regular customers’, for their personal protection, the sort of gloves they dispense at the fuel pumps. He said they had also been instructed by the company to wash their hands every half hour. It was reassuring to see a doctor on local TV demonstrating how the virus could be dispersed and destroyed simply with soap and hot water. A helpful e-mail circulated around our parish (origin, an American University) said that COVID19 was not a living organism but a protein molecule covered by a protective layer of fat, hence the effectiveness of soap and hot water. Unlike bacteria, it cannot be destroyed by anti-biotics or ‘bacteriacides’. An old friend, our retired solicitor, now a widower, told us he was going to the airport to meet his Chinese friend (we have not met her) who had just been home to Hong Kong to visit her family. He was taking her a supply of groceries and then they were going to self-isolate. Later, a couple of mutual friends phoned to ask us if he was all right as they had failed to contact him. He is home now and said he found the isolation very trying. He is a ‘pillar of the town’ and always involved in local affairs. He and B are both philatelists, now busy sorting their stamp collections and swapping surplus by leaving boxes at their respective front doors, then waving from the car. A stamp dealing friend is having trouble continuing his business in the circumstances so he is sending B big boxes in the post, ‘sweepings from the floor’ he says, which B then sorts and shares. Meanwhile the Chinese lady is busy at home making face masks. B is due to have an operation in the Bristol Hospital cardio-vascular clinic. It is classed as ‘elective’ surgery and has been postponed indefinitely, simply because they need to be sure of an Intensive Care bed for recovery. B was worried that his case constitutes an ‘underlying health problem’ and he thought his chances of surviving if he caught the virus were less than 50%. I tried to persuade him he does not have a disease, he just needs a repair job. His general health is good. He is not in the same position as people having chemo-therapy for example or asthma. We should have been on holiday just now. When the date for the operation was first provisionally fixed, we brought forward our holiday plans. I pointed out that April in Cumbria often meant snow. Ironically, the weather now, this year has been better than we have ever known. I wonder – ‘Is it better to be isolated at home in wall-to wall sunshine when you long to be out exploring the country, or cold and gloomy when you want to huddle indoors?’. Bright sunshine wins every time. However, I am longing for the wide Westmorland Fells, Hadrian’s Wall country, the great open skies of the Solway Firth. We rarely go to the Lakes these days because of the crowds (and our days of walking the high tops are gone I am afraid) but it must be beautiful just now for those who live there. One could say ‘Well, there’s always next year’ but for us now, there might not be a next year, and we had already paid for our stay. The cottage owner said we could transfer our booking to later, but I doubt that will be possible. Likewise a provisionally booked autumn stay in Pembrokeshire. It is worse for the farmers (who have become friends), who rely on holiday bookings for part of their annual income. Our village Art Group normally meets weekly in the village hall and by March 12, we were asked if any of us thought we should suspend. We all firmly kept our hands down, feeling that life was for living and we were not going to cower at home in fear of infection. However, I did go into the kitchen and give the Hall’s tea mugs a good wash (some of them rather stained). We tend to blame the Toddler Group Mums for this. The Yoga group in turn complain that we leave traces of paint or chalk pastels that stain their mats! The cleaner came in and announced she was taking away the tea towels which she normally launders, and leave paper rolls instead. She is someone who, when seen coming, strikes fear into our leader (a retired teacher) even though half her age. She is the local ‘busybody’ (she has also locked the gate of the children’s playground) but we could hardly function without her. Village politics! By the next week however, it was clear that a-self isolation policy was not about us, but about stopping the virus for everybody’s sake, so we stopped meeting. I also sent out emails about the monthly Coffee Get-Together that I organise for a group of friends in the village. A couple of older members e-mailed back saying they had been thinking reluctantly that they ought to ‘give it a miss’ and self-isolate. They thanked me for making the decision for them. Another friend wondered why, but she lives in a world of her own! I phoned the pub where we meet and they said they had been expecting it, thanking me for letting them know. The pub has been run by a local family for two generations and we feel we owe them loyalty so, when ‘lock-down’ came a couple of days later, we were pleased to hear they had switched their kitchen operations to making take-away meals, like a number of other enterprising caterers. There was also an invitation to the village to take along any suitable containers we could lay our hands on to collect all his surplus beer! A week before that, (March 10) I had been into town for a routine dental check. I always go early in the day to avoid the crowds. Since retiring, I have never caught flu, or similar viral infections, but B was getting nervous, so to placate him, I wore a pair of the disposable gloves on the Park and Ride, feeling a bit silly. I removed them inside the Dentist’s door and the receptionist smiled and said ‘I see you have come prepared’. She pointed to a bottle of hand sanitiser on the counter. I also went to the Central Library and was pleased to see not one, but two books by favourite authors that I quickly grabbed. I already had one book at home, together with a couple of non-fictions from the mobile library, so I felt prepared for at least a few weeks lock down. Later, the Library e-mailed borrowers telling us our books were automatically renewed until July. We had been hearing on the news about the lock down in France and wondered how the Parisians were coping. The next day I went to the chiropodist, again wearing gloves until inside the door. She insisted on giving me a pair of blue, medical issue gloves to take away with me. ES, who has a degree in forestry, had to give up his rented cottage a few years ago and move back with us. It has led to an over-crowded house (and fridge!) but it is handy to have him here now. His girlfriend is a professional (not sure what) at Bath Hospital so of course, she is isolated from social contact. One of his part time jobs is Clerk to the Parish Council, whose elected members are stood down for the duration, so the Local Authority, who pay him a small salary, have told him he is in charge! The last job the Parish did was to put out a flier to everyone, listing contacts for fetching shopping, volunteer help, ‘someone to talk to if needed’. Our local sub-Postmaster has always taken supplies to the housebound from his small shop, so he was co-ordinator. However, he is already run off his feet, and it was found that people were using it for trivial errands, and the social media site for ‘silly chit-chat’ so the group of volunteers has taken over. ES cycled the village to distribute fliers. The cricket field, used by the village for decades, probably a century, legally belongs to the adjoining estate, recently having a new owner, a well known business tycoon. He has just applied to replace the attractive traditional wooden pavilion, which is in perfectly good shape, with a modern building quite out of character, and also do some ‘landscaping’. We know full well that this term means fencing off the field, stopping everybody from walking their dogs around the outside (polite notices ask people to keep dogs off the ‘in-field’ and clean up after them -some ‘poo-bins’ are provided). He already has a large estate. Why does he need to keep the village out of the field? He cannot reclaim the smaller adjoining green that a previous ‘squire’ gave to the village in perpetuity. Loss of the cricket field area would however be a blow to those who want to walk round, or just sit and watch cricket (few of the village team are actually resident). It would mean the end of the big summer fete that attracts people for miles around, with marquees, stalls and games and dog shows and a band. There is simply not enough room for it on the smaller green, let alone any car parking. We are sure his London financial advisers have chosen this time deliberately to apply for planning permission. ES, with the Parish Chairman, is going to ask for an extension to the Planning Appeal period. In the meantime, B as always, is spending half the day chatting on the phone to old friends, retired colleagues, cousins he grew up with and many more distant cousins he has discovered since he took up Family History research. Cousin M in Kent said she had taken to wearing disposable gloves on the bus. Cousin B, a retired nurse in S Yorkshire, with her husband, is still clearing up after the February flooding (they live near Staithes). Their garage floor was under water in February but, unlike many of their neighbours, they did not have water over their doorstep. In more normal times, it would still be in the news but she says everybody has forgotten them. They are still cheerfully carrying on. Cousin R near Telford meanwhile complained they had spent a whole morning going round supermarkets, but finding all the shelves stripped bare. I have noticed sometimes when visiting other parts of the country, the difference in supermarket culture. In the West Midlands, shoppers go around grimly focussed on the job, oblivious of others. Around Bath, people are more relaxed, even exchanging jokes with strangers. In S Wales, the supermarket is a social venue! B asked cousin R if she could not find what she wanted in the small shops but she said they all disappeared long ago. Cousin S (West Midlands) said his neighbour was livid to find the local pharmacy had ‘more than doubled’ the price of a packet of paracetamol. S advised him to tell the local TV who would shame the shop for such blatant profiteering. You would expect pharmacists to be more public spirited. Another distant cousin near Wolverhampton was so desperate about the empty shops she was talking of going to relatives in Devon. Two (unconnected) friends in Wales had daughters/grand daughters working in Birmingham who were coming home for the same reason. Meanwhile Cousin R quoted a nursing friend in Birmingham who said their hospital was half empty, especially A&E departments. Could this be because the pubs and clubs were closed and the road traffic so much less, or could it be that people with minor complaints are simply avoiding hospitals? I read somewhere that the national death rate in India had dropped considerably in the pandemic, due to the reduction in road traffic in that country! Then we had disturbing news from Cousin M in Kent, who was unwell. Her daughter living a few miles away had had the virus, recovered, and gone back to work in London. The doctor advised going to A&E but M refused at first. Then an ambulance had to be called and arrived in record time. They found she had had a heart attack. The hospital was half empty. She was home a couple of days later feeling much better. However she overheard medical staff discussing asking her to sign a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ form. She told them in no uncertain terms that she had a husband and family to look after and she still had a life to live! We only heard all this later through cousin B, the ex-nurse, who warned my husband B ‘DO NOT SIGN ANY FORMS’! We do not know if some medical staff are personally keen to ‘write off’ the elderly, or if this is a discrete policy by some regional health authorities – not ours here in the South West, I am sure. Returning to the subject of panic buying at supermarkets, at the risk of sounding smug, I did not have any problems. Having lived most of our lives out of town, I always keep a good stock of essentials in case of winter snow, floods or other emergencies. It helps that we live in an older house with a good pantry and cupboard space. Our chest freezer, (back-up to the fridge freezer) packed up in January after many years, so we had just replaced it with a small new one, which is well stocked. Then the official Lock Down started. Everything went very quiet! There is a main road passing our gate and normally, by day, the traffic noise is continuous, but it became quiet as night. I normally spend my days rushing around from one thing to another, but with so much activity curtailed, I slowed down. Parkinson’s Law definitely holds! We could sit in the garden and listen to the birds, even a woodpecker drumming in the woods quarter of a mile away. B was dozing after lunch and awoke to find a Little Owl watching him from a tree! Unlike most owls, they often fly by day, but we very rarely see them. I do not know if the lack of traffic was the reason we saw so much wildlife in the garden, or simply because we had the time to sit in the sun (with the excuse that UV light kills viruses!). The garden was full of colour. You could hardly tread between the primroses on the front lawn. Violets and forget-me-knots were everywhere and then the trees burst into clouds of blossom, yellow or pink and white. We expect a bumper crop of apples this year that will break the branches of our ancient apple trees if we are not careful. I am sure the reason was the mild winter, followed by so much sunshine we have enjoyed from the beginning of March. Usually at this time of year, we are away holiday for two or three weeks, so we miss this most colourful time in our own garden. Whether it was due to the lack of road traffic or simply the unusual weather we saw lots of birds flying in the garden, we had butterflies and bees, hoverflies, bumblebees (3 different species) and a couple of hornets. Then jubilation, as ES lifted some builders’ rubble waiting to go to the tip and found two hedgehogs! We have not seen any for years. Then he looked closely at a makeshift pond he made and saw a newt. We found a toad in a weedy corner. A domestic goose appeared on the roadside verge and a passing motorist tried to catch it without success. I have no idea where it came from, but in the evening I saw it in the field next door. It looked happy but I did not give much for its chances. A fox regularly leaves his mark in our garden overnight. I went for a walk next day, half expecting to find a pile of feathers, but there was no trace. Our garden is not especially big, but gets rather neglected. By the time we normally return from holiday the weeds have taken hold. This year B and ES made a determined effort to cultivate some overgrown flower beds. ES, among other things, normally does odd-job gardening for a couple of friends. In the current situation, he was keen to cultivate ours instead, and grow vegetables and salad for home use. They even cleared out the old greenhouse, and ES went ‘over the top’ buying lots of seed packets and bags of compost. I considered what to do at home while locked down. I thought about spring cleaning, maybe turning out some cupboards but, my excuse, the council Refuse and Recycling services are struggling with staff shortages so I did not want to burden them with more, the Tip is closed and so are the charity shops. There are no Jumble Sales for local causes. Instead, I did some very inexpert gardening. At first, the traffic was very light. There were a lot of tractors – local farmers catching up on work delayed by the floods. A few delivery trucks and vans at first -these soon increased. Cyclists were making the most of the empty roads, and ES took the opportunity to go out himself. If anyone asked, he could say he was on Parish council business, but no one did. Motor cyclists soon discovered the empty roads meant they could roar past, well over the speed limit. Though the noise was disturbing, I could not see any great harm, but I think the police soon put a stop to their joy riding. The reason the police gave was that they were likely to crash and divert NHS resources. I would have thought accidents were more likely in heavy traffic than on these half empty roads. B often went out for a short walk (doctor’s orders) along the road to where a parking space leads to a popular path through the woods. One day he met a cheerful crew from the ‘Highways’. They had been sent to clear the drains blocked by the ‘cowboys’ who resurfaced the road last winter, but their machine broke. (I would have thought a pickaxe would have done the job but who am I to say?). They said it was so nice working by a (currently) quiet country road rather than their usual location dodging traffic on a busy motorway and so, with the sun shining, they were enjoying a picnic! B was just coming out of the woods on another day when a policeman on a motor bike ‘leapt out of the bushes’ and asked if he was local, B wearing gum boots at the time. He pointed to our house, just visible. The policeman turned his attention to two ‘harmless old ladies’ just getting out of a car, and told them to go back home. This seemed quite unnecessary. On another day however, B came home furious having passed, on a narrow stretch of path, a man in running kit, wearing headphones, who was ‘coughing and spluttering’. His girlfriend just behind was saying to someone on the phone ‘He’s not supposed to be out really’. On another occasion he met a girl who said she came from Bath and ‘could not see what all the fuss was about’. She thought the virus might be good thing, as it might ‘free up the housing market’ so they could buy somewhere to live!! I am afraid the situation has exposed some ‘inter-generational’ conflict, although it must be said, many younger people have reacted heroically in helping out. The sudden drop in road traffic has certainly improved air quality in town. Bath, lying in a hollow, is notorious for pollution. The council have just delayed their plans to introduce a Clean Air Zone, which had caused a lot of controversy, but was sorely needed. Now the decision has been put off. B used to spend time on his lap-top idly tracking civilian air traffic, now almost ceased. One intriguing aircraft trace on his screen however was a series of parallel lines, up and down along a rectangular stretch of the Welsh Border. He concluded that the Ordnance Survey must be making the most of the situation to carry out a mapping survey. In the first couple of weeks of lock-down, the sky was an intense blue. I thought at the time ‘the environmentalists will claim this is the effect of grounding all the airliners’. The cause was actually nothing of the kind. The atmospheric situation in the north Atlantic was an intense area of high pressure to the NW which brought us very clear, dry Polar air. The strong Spring sunshine made the air warmer at surface levels, but the humidity level was exceptionally low. My early career was in the Met Office so I automatically register such factors. Anticyclones are areas of descending air, coming down from high altitudes, (just like the air on a mountain summit). An article in ‘Weather’ magazine described a similar situation in January this year when the atmospheric pressure was the highest recorded since 1932 (and before that, 1902). The author included a photograph of intensely blue sky over his home in Berkshire. That occurred before all the aircraft were grounded. However ground level air pollution in towns has quite demonstrably improved with the reduction in road traffic. Meanwhile, a science programme on TV showing a satellite view of China had a distinct ‘hole’ in the air pollution over Wuhan. When the official lockdown started, ES took over the food shopping for the household. I never thought I would miss going to Sainsburys! It was a bit inconvenient to write out precise shopping lists. I felt sorry for him too, having to stand in a queue before he could go in, and then feeling he had to be quick to avoid holding up other people. Sometimes he spent rather more than I would have done but it could not be helped. He also did the weekend shopping at the Farm Shop and one day, I went as a passenger, sitting in his car. I had a pleasant half hour watching, and then sketching, the pigs in the field, happily wallowing in liquid mud, while he queued in a cold windy car park! With many shops now refusing to handle cash, I feel this is going to have repercussions in the way we shop, long after this current crisis. Ever since I qualified for a pension I have withdrawn my (partial) State pension in cash for the weekly shopping, which was a constraint on the amount I spent. I had to watch how much was left in my purse at end of the week. When you use card payment, it is easy to overspend. When the Blair government proposed to scrap the old Pension Book, some 20 years ago, there was an outcry because many pensioners did not have bank accounts and anyway, we wanted to continue to use our local Post Office. Our village WI (now sadly defunct) instructed me to write to our MP about it. Government quickly devised a Post Office Account with a bank cards so that we could continue to draw cash there. Now that all the major banks have Post Office links, and there are fewer pensioners without bank accounts, this system will soon end. I fear those pressing for a ‘cashless society’ will soon have won. But what happens when electronic banking fails or crashes through natural or malicious malfunctions? How would we contribute to one-off charity sales or buy a ‘Big Issue’? How would I collect our weekly Art Group subs? On one occasion recently I had filled up with petrol at the local garage and found a queue at the till. An embarrassed lady at the front was saying ‘But the Bank only issued that card to me yesterday’. It had crashed the system. The harassed attendant did not know what to do. However, I was able to pay cash, walking past the queue of impatient customers, and carry on my way. At the official lockdown, B and ES together tried to ‘lay down the law’ and confine me to the house. I took exception to this because a) I am in good shape, and age is no definition of fitness and b) I am not devoid of common sense. It is easy to avoid potential infection in our situation and I was not going to take any silly risks. For years, I have always washed my hands coming home from town, and before preparing foods. However, when they began their lectures, I considered hiding my car keys in case B took it into his head to ‘confiscate’ them! I did however, insist on regularly visiting our younger son YS, who lives in the village a mile away. He is disabled, with mobility problems, but very determinedly independent. Like me, he takes a more ‘laid back’ view of the risk. He has a 2-bed cottage and can park his car outside. He works part time in a city museum which is, of course, closed at present. He has long had a regular supermarket delivery slot. He does occasionally need some help however. His young Norfolk terrier has free access to the garden but he is overjoyed to be taken for walks and the regular dog-walker cannot come at present so I take him, on a lead, to the cricket field, or along a local footpath and occasionally meet friends for a brief, socially distanced chat. YS and dog also come to Sunday lunch every week and I strongly resist any suggestion that they should not continue to do so. It is difficult to avoid continuous news on TV. Whenever there is a big story the BBC news department can only be described as ‘wallowing in it’ – BREXIT, then the Election, and now this. You would think there was nothing else going on in the world. Moreover, the BBC news is persistently negative and critical. With the currents news it is hardly surprising that many more people are said to be having mental health problems when all we hear is ‘doom and gloom’. The local news, Points West, is rather better and more balanced but even that can hardly leave the subject of CORVID19, so I stopped listening to the TV news long ago. If I switch on, I put it on ‘mute’ until the weather forecast, the only useful thing since the local news was curtailed. We get a daily paper, not always the same one, and the local papers, which seem to represent a variety of viewpoints. There are always some who are carping and critical, constantly seeking scapegoats. In the current situation, the government is in a difficult position, balancing sometimes conflicting advice from medics and epidemiologists and from statisticians, not to mention the economists and all the other experts having their say from their own particular viewpoint. It would be amazing if, in the end, they had always got it right. Politicians all over the world are trying to deal with their own, slightly different problems, and every democratic government across the world is facing criticism from people who think they know better, or are arguing with the benefit of hindsight. If all these ‘armchair experts’ and journalists and commentators think they know better, why are they not standing for election and running the country? It is right that questions should be asked -that is democracy -but I am sick of those who are persistently negative and always think they know better. Organisations that have come in for particular criticism include the World Health Organisation but, like all UN organisations, it was always going to be in a difficult position. It does seem that the Chinese have a sinister influence. But then we received a ‘free’ 15 page newspaper in the post, called ‘Epoch News’ or something. It promised to be completely independent and truthful, written by ‘award winning journalists’ (aren’t they all?). Page after page of attacks on the Chinese regime, much of it the same things that I was saying at the beginning of this piece. However, I began to ‘smell a rat’, feeling that I was being manipulated. The sources, in small print, at the end, included the ‘New York Press Association’. I put it in the bin. Who can you believe? I think the best way is to consult as many different sources as possible. I do not subscribe to social media, or trust it for one moment, but there are many other news organisations. During lockdown, I have been wading, slowly, through a copy of John Simpson’s ‘Unreliable Sources’ -a history of news reporting in the UK in the 20th century. It shows all too clearly how newspapers and TV companies, the BBC included, have pushed their own (or their owners) political views – the Harmsworth dynasty, Beaverbrook, Rupert Murdoch and the heads of the BBC and ITV companies have all pushed their own viewpoints. Back in March (I am now writing in June) we were horrified by news pictures from Italy of victims lying coughing in hospital corridors, for lack of Intensive Care beds. We had also seen and wondered how the Chinese managed to build a brand new hospital from nothing in Wuhan. Anything they can do we can do too! You just have to ask the right people. The Army stepped in and in the space of days, had set up and equipped emergency isolation hospitals in converted buildings across the country. Only one so far has been needed. The other"

It is difficult to really isolate ourselves because we have to have so many visitors to our house. We have 'Carers'	twice a day to attend to my husband and also a district Nurse is coming weekly to dress my husband's sore ankles (bedsores)   My cleaner who is very good and lives locally, comes for two and a half hours every week to help me with the heavy housework. I also suffer from Angina, but at the moment I am managing to cope with	the extra stress and worry of my husband.    I also have to shop for	essentials like hand wipes and flushable toilet wipes and also collect and deposit prescription requests at our local pharmacy.	We also have a gardener visit every two weeks because I cannot do the heavy work in a our garden.	Over the last two years I had started using Internet shopping for groceries. (Thanks to tuition from my marvellous son-in-law)		However the last time I tried to place an order approx two weeks ago, half way through my list I was told that they had deleted the goods I had already ordered because I had taken too long! So I had to go to the supermarket in person and physically buy the goods I needed.	If they do the same again how is that going to help me stay isolated?	I need to have some shopping delivered, because of osteo-arthritis	I cannot lift heavy bags or parcels.  Our daughter  & son-in-law and grandchildren live-on the other side of Ipswich and they help as much as they can, but both adults are working.  Our daughter is a highly trained nurse in the local hospital and our son-in-law is an Electronics expert and our two lovely grandchildren		have outside interests that they need to be taken too in their spare time. Therefore	I cannot always get their help when I most need it. In the last few days I have only been to local shops to get fresh eggs, milk, vegetables	& breadmaking	flour. ( I have made my own bread for years)	But friends have told me about the empty shelves in the supermarkets. My husband's carer was telling me yesterday she had great difficulty in purchasing some meat to make a meal with. I have meat and fish in my freezer but my worry is when it is all used will I be able to replace it?	I also have a fairly well stocked pantry, how long will those goods last if I cannot replace them?	Any shopping takes twice as long as it used to do, because of all the queueing I have to do; even our local Pharmacy is making people queue by only admitting one person at a time into the shop.      In a way we have been self	isolating	for the last four years, because my husband cannot stand or walk anymore	due to the long term effects of Polio, and I cannot get him into our car any longer. In the last four years		If he has a hospital appointment we have to book a wheelchair accessible taxi to get him there and back again,	we have not had a meal in a restaurant, or been to the theatre. or the cinema, during this period. He can only go into our garden if the 'Carers' come and hoist him into his wheelchair and take him outside.I cannot lift or move him anymore.2	H236 However the Coronavirus has meant that friends and family cannot come and visit us.		I really	miss seeing our lovely grandchildren ( A boy of 15 and his sister who is 11).	We have only been able to see and talk to them via	the phone.	My daughter tells me that our grandson is like a caged lion, because he cannot go and play football for his team and he cannot even have friends round to kick a ball round their garden . He was also due to take his O Levels	this spring, so no one knows what is going to happen		at the present time.			I have not been to my Women's Institute meetings for two months, because they have been closed until the situation  clears. WE have a book reading group within our W.I and I really miss that very much.	I have also been unable to attend our Methodist	church due in part to looking after my husband and now because of the Virus situation..One of our worries is that our daughter could catch the virus in the hospital during her working day, we have been reading the newspapers and listening to the news	and we realised how many medical staff are being affected with the virus.        It amazes my husband and I, how quickly the virus seems to have spread across the world! I suppose that is one of the drawbacks of the modern era that people can travel to foreign countries so easily. When I was a child I never ever thought that I would have foreign holidays.	My husband and I have only been to European countries , we have never visited Asia .America or Australia. It seems incredible that a small town in China can create such havoc In such a short length of time!Since I began to write this directive about the Coronavirus my husband's	condition had deteriorated	still further, he is now confined to bed.	A recent bone scan showed	that the cancer is spreading quite rapidly to his bones and particularly to his spine, and this is affecting his bowels. We have had to have more visits from District Nurses, Doctors , Occupationai Therapists etc. It was finally decided to admit him to our local hospice here in Ipswich		I have been trying to keep up with news via Newspapers and Television but as you will appreciate I have to give my husband more attention than ever!At this time	(April  28th	I have just had to	see my husband  put into an Ambulance)and taken off to our local hospital because he needs treatment that cannot be done at home) I have also had a phone call from our daughter to say that she has seen him	in theAccident & Emergency	Dept  and they are going  to test him for the  Coronavirus,So of course ,if the test proves positive we shall have to go into really strict quarantine The whole family) our daughter may not be allowed to	work in the hospital until the results arrive.	What I think is so peculiar about this virus, is the wide range of ages that it is affecting , babies are dying of it when they are only a few days old, and yet a lady of 106 has actually survived and was shown leaving the hospital in a wheelchair. It is also tragic, that people who have Medical training, have come out of retirement to help the situation, and in a brief time they are dead from the Virus!3	H2639    I also cannot believe, that supposedly one of	the  most important man in public life, the President of the U.S.A. is making such ridiculous		statements as telling people the should think about injecting them selves with disinfectant to kill the virus. Don't the American people realise how discreditable he is?.I am now wring this page On Sunday May the 10th 2020, my husband is now terminally ill and	was taken yesterday, into our local Hospice here in Ipswich, for end of Life care.Our daughter and I are taking it in turns to be with him, because of the Corona virus. only one member of the family can be with a patient at any time, because the medical staff do not want too many people walking round the Hospice at this period of high infection. I feel so distressed that the whole family cannot be with him at this time!	My husband has always tried to live a 'Normal ' life despite being disabled and it is so heartbreaking to see this proud independent man totally helpless and unable to do anything for himself!	Our daughter and I take it in turns to be there at meal times so that we can feed him, to take what little work we can do off the nurses and care workers.	I am also having to do more work in the house than I have done for several years, because our regular cleaner has been told that she cannot go into different houses in case they bring the Covid 19 into each individual, She is employed by Age UK and they have suspended their Home Help service for the present time. I also feel sorry for her as well as myself, because she is not being paid for her marvellous help with us and other customers in the same circumstances.          As you will see by our ages we have been retired for many years, so the problem of going to work is of no consequence!		However it has made a difference to our social life because friends and family would come over to see us because my husband could not go to see them. And of course all this visiting had to stop once the Covid 19	appeared	on the scene.	It has also become worse for me to see this man who I have been married to for 52years and who I love dearly,	deteriorate day by day in front of my eyes.	It has also made our house more uncomfortable when we need most comfort because of all the Medical equipment and devices he needed to be cared for at home. e.g Electric Hospital bed two different types of hoist to move him		form bed to chair. Eventually he was confined to bed because he was so fragile.	It has also affected when I can, and cannot go out of the house because of having to wait for a Nurse or Doctors visit.	When appointments are made they can only say it will be morning or afternoon because they are such busy people, and therefore I have to wait until they actually appear.		We are so fortunate to have the NHS becausethe care and attention my husband has received and is still receiving	is faultless.       I think this' clapping for Carer's is rather a nonsense!. Something much more practical would be to give the Medical staff trying to cope with this Pandemic a decent pay rise and the correct PPE equipment to prevent them selves being affected. You only have to read a daily paper	to see how many valuable staff have died with the Virus. It seems the height of nonsense to order PPE equipment from China & Turkey and find they are not suitable, why in heaven's name are we not manufacturing	our own . Why did not the politicians think of this when we were first hit by the virus?	In fact why are we actually buying any goods from China? When we do it often falls apart after a very brief time . I always try and buy British if I am purchasing any thing for the house.       I feel that shops like M & S have lost their superiority because it's the most English Dept/ store yet nothing is now made in England!	Why are we not employing our own people4	H2639 and get them to make some	Gowns & masks.	I think the Government should have imposed lockdown at an	earlier stage of the Virus appearance.	Perhaps there would not have been so many deaths. Particularly in so many care homes. Don't elderly people count for anything now? My personal hygiene has not altered all.	Why would I not want to be clean and attractive?. The only problem I am finding at the moment is getting my hair cut		(I have short hair in a 'bob') and my hairdresser comes	to the house and	does my hair and also cuts my husband's hair because he cannot get to a barbers any more.	My hair is now much longer than I normally	wear it but until the government gives hairdressers permission to do their work again	it will have to stay like that.     I am never short of occupying my self - If I have books to read and music to listen too, I think my entertainment is complete . in this warm weather I also like gardening and also sewing and of course I still have to do housework to keep my house clean and at the present time I am spending many hours at the hospice with my husband,.	Of course writing M-0 directives	is another great occupation !	Both my husband and myself have missed doing things together. When we began our retirement it was lovely to be able to shut the front door on any dust, get into the car and drive down to the coast at Felixstowe or Aldeburgh have a walk along the promenade and then have a pub lunch or take a picnic with us, andspend the day in the sunshine and fresh air.	As my husband became more disabled from the long term effects of Polio these outing became more and more infrequent,  due to the problems of finding Disabled toilets or buildings that were in accessible for wheelchairs ..      I am old enough to remember the dreadful ASIAN FLU	in 1957	I spent my 17th birthday in bed in Sept 1957 being extremely  ill with this virus. However I don't think the country went to such extreme measures as the country is doing with Covid 19.      I wonder if anyone will find a Vaccine for it?	Look how long it took to invent a vaccine against Polio!-	/"

Age 70 Widow  Bristol  Retired Social Worker Mass-Observation Spring 2021 Part 3 Having the vaccine. I was very excited to find a text on my phone inviting me for the vaccine at the end of January. I am not particularly proficient on the phone, so I was relieved when it proved to be straightforward to book. On Saturday 6 February I decided to drive to the vaccine centre which is about a 30 minutes walk from my house. I was a little worried that I might feel odd afterwards, or that I might be late. The distance was certainly well within my capacity for walking. It was a cold bright morning and I was too early-I had to sit in my car. The vaccine centre was a hub organised by a group of North Bristol GPs and was in the hall of the junior branch of Clifton College. ( I was disappointed not to be going in to the senior section). There was no queue, it was 9.15 am . Outside volunteer marshalls were looking rather cold, but everyone was smiling. Inside I had to give my name and was handed a form to complete about conditions, medications etc. I was amused that the phone text had said to bring your reading glasses-obviously aimed at the senior population from bitter experience. Once that was finished I was beckoned to a table with vaccinator. There were probably 6 or 7 of these around the room, distanced, but not in cubicles or curtained. Once the person had looked at my form she gave me the injection which I did not feel. I was given some information about possible side effects and my precious vaccination card, and advised to sit down in the waiting area for 10-15 minutes. I did not relish the idea of sitting next to others, so returned to wait in my car. I received the Oxford vaccine. I felt fine until about 5pm that day when I became very cold and had fuzziness in the head like flu. My limbs felt heavy and I think I had a fever. I had a snack and took some paracetamol, and went to bed early. Next morning I still felt odd, so took more paracetamol and stayed in bed. By lunch time all these effects had gone. I was surprised to have a reaction to the vaccine, I do not normally react to the flu one. I have continued to follow government guidelines about Covid. I had my second dose of the vaccine April 24, at the same place. This time, although a Saturday at 9.15, like before, it was much busier, and I had to wait about 10 minutes outside. I was asked about any reactions to the 1st dose by the vaccinator, who noted it. It was very quick, and I was home again within half an hour. This time I had a very sore arm almost immediately. Later in the day I felt tremendous aches in my legs, took paracetamol , and slept it off. The effects did not last so long, I was fine the next morning. It made a difference to me to have had 2 doses of the vaccine. I started to do more things, though remaining within the guidelines-so in May I had my hair cut, went to the dentist, entered more shops etc. The best thing was when I could see all my family-I am in bubble with daughter and family, and we were able to meet with my son and family under the two household rule. This is really the most important issue for me. I was so relieved when my children were vaccinated-especially my son, who has worked throughout as a primary school head, and at risk. He only received the vaccine by chance in April because a kind nurse at a nearby GP practice asked his school if anyone would like left over vaccine. Otherwise, as he is not yet 40, he would have had to wait until June. Teachers should have had the vaccine earlier. I have not been concerned about the safety of the vaccine-I trust the Oxford vaccine. In any case, I am quite high risk, because although I have never been in the vulnerable category I do have a lung condition which makes me prone to infections. Therefore taking the vaccine at my age makes sense. I donâ€™t have time to waste. The Vaccine Programme. There have been 2 methods-via GP or NHS. This was not immediately obvious, as I received a text invitation from GP, followed a couple of days later by a letter asking me to book a slot at the local big site which is the football stadium. Later I realised that this was a backup. The programme has been very efficient in our country. However, the issue of priority for certain workers is a difficult one. I can see that many people have been in greater danger-NHS workers, bus drivers, teachers etc. amongst others. I can also appreciate the problems which would have been incurred to try and organise vaccination by occupation. As some people tried to argue they were key workers to get their children places in school when they were closed to all others, this path could have been fraught with difficulties. Now however, I think it should be compulsory for NHS workers and care workers to be vaccinated. They are working with vulnerable people who do not have a choice about who looks after them. It is true that NHS workers already have to be vaccinated against hepatitis, so what is the problem with the Covid vaccine ? I try to read about the vaccine in reliable papers, and listen to the Chief Medical Officers programmes. I also discuss with friends who are medically trained. I am aware of the false news about the vaccine. I find it sad that some sections of the population believe in conspiracy theories concerning the vaccine. I despise people like Piers Corbyn who whip  up ideas like this. However, I feel there has been far too much about Covid in the news , which has contributed to the general anxiety of the public. I try not to watch or listen to extended programmes about victims of Covid, hospitals etc The future I donâ€™t know about vaccine passports. I dislike the idea of having to present evidence to go somewhere in Britain, after all it is an individual choice to go to a football match or theatre. It is likely that some sort of vaccine passport may be required by countries that we wish to visit. We shall see. The movement against vaccinations for children is growing and it is dangerous. I believe these vaccinations should be compulsory. The problem is that, with all vaccines, some people are sacrificed for the good of the rest. The general public does not want to know this."

Before lockdown, I had already started to develop a cold. Some work colleagues had gone down with a cold already…but not COVID-19 related. However, I had a sore throat for about two weeks which became worse than better than worse. I finally resorted to getting some antibiotics which did improve my throat but something is still there at the back of my throat. Having been doing casual work or having bouts of unemployment, I am used to being myself but I felt more restricted in that I knew I couldn’t go out as much. I had to plan my trips to the shop or do the one form of exercise as instructed by the Government. So, for most of the time, I have been fine but for one week, I did become more restless and more worried about myself. I relied a lot more on Facebook to keep in touch which was helped by the fact that my group was more active than it normally was. An old friend also called me a couple of times, knowing I was on my own and not having anyone to talk to. I am glad I don’t have children. I wouldn’t want to worry about them as well as myself. I do feel for those parents who have to find ways of keeping them busy as well as trying to meet their own priorities. I am sure schools have been brilliant in supplying suitable information/materials. I think kids always prove to be pretty resilient during difficult times and can help to lift adults from their day-to-day worries. The last couple of weeks have improved because I managed to get a full-time job at the place in which I had ben temping. It is fortunate that the team’s work has been transferable form having physical workshops and seminars to webinars etc. I have been using Zoom to meet the team I will be in. I have had inductions with majority of them and having chats with some ahead of work. So, getting a new job has been a godsend. However, it is only a year’s contract and I feel that half my contract will be done virtually. I should be getting a company computer so will have access to the network. I will then have no excuse not to do any work in between zoom meetings. However, the nature of the works means I have been able to work pretty much 9-5pm with breaks like it would be in an office. There are discussions about the site re-opening and how staff will work together. It seems that some of the team have become used to working from home and want to continue or at least split time between office and home. I’d be quite happy doing staggered working hours. I would still want to travel to and from work because of the type of company that it is. It’s a library, the library and being in the building is part­inspirational/motivational. On a personal level, I’ve probably used my time much better than when I was unemployed. I have been doing pilates almost every day and as Covid-19 has forced the arts and music sector to go online, I’ve been able to watch performances which I wouldn’t have seen otherwise e.g. Frankenstein, Antony and Cleopatra, The Phantom of the Opera, Love Never Dies and Cats. I have grown to hate poor synchronisation between the sound and the acting/singing. I’ve also donated more than I would do in a normal period – a live music venue, a domestic abuse aid charity, an international development charity. I’ve also discovered online jigsaw puzzles which is addictive. I have to do two every day. On a sad point, my Mum became an asymptomatic carrier of Covid19. Her care home had closed a week ahead of the official lockdown and we couldn’t celebrate Easter or her birthday with her. I bought online gifts for her and though she had to stay in bed, according to reports, she stayed her usual self, displaying behaviour connected to her conditions (dementia and Parkinsons). She has since passed a second test along with other residents but still has to stay in her room. I think it is highly unlikely I will see my Mum for another six to nine months. I don’t want her to die this way so I’d rather not take the risk. I am at greater risk passing something onto her as I would have to travel using the public transport system whereas my brothers could potentially visit her later in the year because they have cars. She will just have to rely on receiving chocolates and plants from me. I think the UK Government has handled it as well as any other country (apart from Germany who seems to always know how to handle crises). They should be criticised for not having enough PPE equipment, especially as we hadn’t been the first country to experience the virus. We had the advantage of observing other countries in order to know what to do. I think the country has been fantastic in adhering to the lockdown rules. There will always be a minority though! I think the NHS, Police, Fire Service and essential shop staff have been fantastic in doing what they have been doing. Hopefully none of them will be overlooked by their bosses when normal life resumes. I think the recent instructions about returning to work are confusing. I will have to use the trains to get to work and I am prepared to do this. I have even bought a face mask! I cannot avoid using the system. I think the Govt should have waited for TfL to come up with a plan about how people should enter train stations and stand in carriages. The queues might encourage some employers to invest in alternate ways of working or travelling e.g. taxi-hire/taxi-sharing. I haven’t been watching the 5pm announcements, only online news in the morning, lunch-time and evening. As with any crises, the information released doesn’t change much and when it does, the topic isn’t relevant to me. There is no point getting stirred up over something that I can’t control or don’t have any say. It might be different if I lived with someone. I’d be open to chat if I did. In terms of accessibility, I would like to think disability charities who provide news service have been able to adapt to the current circumstances and continue to inform them but yes, I think it is important for News services to have a BSL interpreter all the time or for one or two of the main news programme, ideally evening and morning. Shopping-wise, I have been able to buy things which perhaps I wouldn’t have otherwise or pushed back to the back of my mind. I do need to buy a new pair of glasses and watch so any money saved will go towards that. I just need to wait for an opticians to open! I’ve done a weekly shop to buy food for the week with the odd visit to the local store to purchase milk and bread. I think I have bought more because I have chosen more treats/had more money to spend. I don’t make any savings because in one week, I might be buying lots of food, another week, it will be more cleaning materials. On a final point, I have never bought so many tissues and I have never used so much before!! At least one a day…even for days when my nose hasn’t been sniffly."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health It’s interesting reflecting on health because its constantly being talked about but on a day to day basis everyone is trying to get on with their lives. P went into a very silent mode when Greece announced although they would be reopening for visitors they would not be welcoming UK visitors. It’s one thing to know your own Government is doing a terrible job, its another to be seen as unclean and so banned from travel. It wasn’t the whole reason for his low mood, all the other aspects of Covid are hardly laughing matters but that tiny bit of hope taken away is hard to take. We are very privileged but of course its out of our control. That insecurity and lack of trust in the Government in their poor action and lack of good faith. It’s hard to just live with as there is nothing we can do. We have avoided injury or serious illness, apart from Covid at the beginning and apart from Mum who has somehow caused her wrist to swell and had lovely help over the phone from the Doctor and repeat prescriptions delivered we have been here at home. Various friends have had to go to A &E OR fracture clinic and I had an ultrasound just before lockdown was imposed. All swift efficient in empty hospitals or collecting prescriptions from silent medical centres with patient silent queues. I have kept busy, lambing gardening filling the background with audiobooks and concentrated actions has kept it all at bay fairly successfully. Have been supporting friends who are struggling and have friends and family who are sheilded (although after yesterdays total b******** who knows where they stand now. We are told at the beginning 1:3 were frightened by Covid but now it 1:6 and the debacle of Dominic bloody Cummings and the subsequent rapid release from lockdown without tests being met has not helped. Pictures yesterday fo Durdle Dor where 100s were crammed on a beach which was then packed even tighter as the air ambulance landed to pick up two seriously injured fools who had been tombstoning off the top. No chance of social distancing there, and tomorrow schools go back. Mine actually will not open its doors to non key workers and non vulnerable children A month later before formal opening on 4 July everyone had turned up at Bournemouth beaches today and yesterday its that no one seems able to recognise there is not yet an established normal and that the previous normal is not coming back anytime soon, if ever and if we do not work with some sort of wiser restraint we will be back under lockdown or whatever idea the Government can come up with and it does not have to be like this. We could start to reestablish a version of stable normality if we kept some working rules but there are really no absolutes for preventing spread except no contact and if we do that we’ll have not an economy. Its time to think differently and plan differently and yet so many people seem to want to just go back to their previous normal pretend none of this has happened, is happening. So health, superficially all fine and yet I cannot read a book for long, I fill my ears with audiobooks, podcasts or radio programmes, this is a very successful way of stopping thinking, one I have always used but the fact I cannot read a book or concentrate on research indicates to me that the worry about the instability and uncertain times is just buried under the surface. The children had a big row about a minor thing tonight the first in lockdown and P ended up upset. I know he is hugely worried about everything but I had not realised how worried I just bury myself and separate from the worries but P is clearly stewing. We can go to Salcombe for a break in 2 weeks and that will help i think but with the uncertainty unlikely to end we all need small changes to stay sane. I think we are all the same its not a long holiday from normal life, its a long absence from everyday life with no idea of exactly what comes next and how it will all look this week, next week, next month, next year. We are not used to such uncertainty and instability and we seem not to cope well with this; either bury out heads or stay angry and scared. Neither are healthy. Teaching children this week I have realised just how much they need each other they need the routine of school of the boring the mundane and the fun: the surety of Monday, the clearly defined holidays and weekends. They do not always love it, we do not always love work or getting up to go but the absence of it all is a form of limbo. Most have some level of worry about their lives or the future and that adds a subtext to everything subconsciously and consciously often children just read the subtext of worry and school is the safe place. Currently, this is not available to them. So at every level the world is unsafe and insecure. For us all. And nobody’s health benefits from uncontrolled and unpredictable, insecurity. For us lambing gave a clear frame and for H farming carries on doing this. J is still bucking the trend by being far happier working from home than actually at school and he illustates the other side. I have a dear friend who is getting divorced from a bully, has a boss who is a bully and has found the last year so hard. Being on lockdown and on furlough has given her breathing space and time to regain some balance and perspective. I think she will find she has more energy to cope with resolving the divorce and deciding what to do about work. She looks well and happier than she has in a very long time. So I suspect for some the mental health issues of Covid will be more about the effects on their health of returning to a more normal highly stressed life. I suspect hindsight will teach us much. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I think this Government is careless, arrogant, selfserving, dishonest, fraudulent and so bothered about brexit and power it is currently demolishing our democracy and allowing excess deaths of their citizens. It is complicit in creating conditions that almost guarantee a second wave of significant proportions for which they are unprepared and unwilling to discuss preparing for and have been shown to give huge multimillion £ contracts to companies with turnovers of £18K and their only experience in pest control. In having a ‘special adviser’ the puppetmaster rasputin, of his day Cummings, pulling their strings. He was art of the group who resisted lockdown eventually capitulating based on flawed modelling from Imperial who had not updated their doubling data to reflect the Italian experience which showed doubling time was far shorter than the 5 days we were working on, so delayed lockdown too long 356 deaths as opposed to Germany’s 63. Cummings who helped set the lockdown rules then runs from London, knowing he is infected and so is his wife up the M1 No doubt stopping to infect a few at petrol stations and toilets with their 5 year old. He then went for a jolly to Barnard Castle to test his eyes drove his son and wife for 30 mins to test his eyes. And of course he did not resign. He is holding them all up and driving brexit. The Covid crisis is of course unprecedented but it is unprecedented that our Governments approach has resulted in the terrible funding for the NHS over 10 years, the lack of PPE including not joining the EU PPE scheme and lying about it being offered. They cannot even admit when they have made a decision they spin they lie they twist and fundamentally they do not care if they cared at all we would have more confidence. Worst of all we have 4 more years of these idiot wreckers. They are demolishing our rights, our lives, they are pushing brexit when out economy is destroyed they want to destroy the UK and there seems to be nothing at all we can do. I lobby I write, I tweet, and I sign the petitions but the hope is so tenuous. It’s all so hard to not just give into despair. On top of that people seem to fail to understand that if our Government does not want to protect us we must protect ourselves. Masks -why not, social distance maintain it for us all. The vulnerable and shielded we need to protect. It is simple the virus is her to stay, it cannot be corralled and made to disappear so instead we must live with it. But be honest and truthful about it all and this Government’s inability to tell the truth about anything from testing numbers to their 5 tests to real R numbers means the population who are thinkgin feel lost alone abandoned and very vulnerable. I hope I am being pessimistic, I fear I am not. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? New Scientist CEBM -Oxford Covid research Centre The Zoe Covid recording app and webinars Twitter for headlines then drill deep for facts and fake news. On line Independent and Guardian, Byline Times Tortoise No radio no TV for news Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. No rapidly recognised picking splinters of truth from a cascade of dishonest spin was not good for my health. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? If you are a member of the electorate in this country you should be able to see whatever the Government are saying so yes of course. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. My work stopped the Friday before lockdown when schools closed for all but key worker and vulnerable children. I have missed it although in the early weeks helping with lambing and the animals kept me pretty busy. Shopping takes so long when going for neighbours too and food for 6 adults is interminable. P has been at home since Wed before. He finds the lack of split between home and work hard. He has regular wellbeing sessions with his team and its hard. They are doing rolling furloughs across the firm to make it equal for all but his group are at 80% with a full workload so working at 120%. If I had been depending on my income this would have been a very lean time. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? It has been amazing to have all the children home for one last time and also my son’s lovely girlfriend who has been helping him. Generally it has been a really happy time with everyone getting on and enjoying more time with fewer pressures. Surprisingly, mostly we have had few arguments and lots of shared time. We have had more meals together than ever before and more chats debates and discussions. It is unlikely all these adults will live together for more than the odd week ever again as they will be making their own lives. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? We started coffee twice a week on whatsapp and that happens most weeks and although it usually takes 3 attempts to get D, M and M and I on all together it works well. I have also been doing hit and Pilates online through teams and a prerecorded one with my Rowing Pilates teacher on You tube. I have had Governors meetings on Teams where one participant is always upside down or sideways on! It has generally worked well and my husband has found the same. I have joined webinars on various platforms and attended mediation on zoom. I miss real people now but its better than not doing it and I prefer the live versions as you can chat afterwards which in strict lockdown was a release. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I could not be bothered with getting up at 1 in the morning to book slots so as we though we had had Covid, once quarantine was over I have shopped every week. For the first few weeks things changed every time as we were given rules on one way shopping woebetide you if you forget -queues , only pick once -impossible in choosing a ripe avocado! And the constant dance to keep 2m and get your stuff. Knowing you are stuck in a one way route means every shopping list has to be clear and accurate. K has helped immeasurably to shop and cook and plan. The boys have done the odd bit. P more. We have fish,milk and fresh bread deliveries as well as veg boxes -these have a narrower choice but I was so glad I was a long term customer and could get a slot. Bread is new and the bakery are amazing. Brunos in Studley including delivering a high cream tea for my Mum’s birthday. We all baked loads in the early weeks, which was unfortunate as flour disappeared for many many week completely and only became a permanent feature in supermarkets about 3 weeks ago -10/11 weeks into lockdown. Local stores managed to get some a bit earlier from local mills. My neighbours who I shop for want Marmite -but yeast is still in very short supply 14 weeks on and so no marmite. Shopping for 3 neighbours us and my parents meant I volunteered poor K to help. My parents have gone back to shopping in full PPE this week.. I went back to work so am now wearing a mask in public places Supported local shops, the book shop, the butcher, the sewing shop the milkman and the veggie suppliers. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I have been making a tepee and face masks on my sewing machine. I have painted a little , read a little, listened to hours of audio. Read too much twitter and taken long breaks from twitter. Read and watched science about the virus, taken breaks from that. Watched a few series and a few films gardened,tidied and cleaned, cooked and cooked. And spun though days with little to show for it. Done some of my course, planned some sessions for anxious children, worked on the school garden and school display, talked to friends and FaceTimed, taken classes and undertaken online seminars. Often managed to be remarkable solitary in a house full of people all doing their own thing. Avoided music as it is always about emotion and feeling and so too much brain free flow. I have filled my time as much as I can whilst still having days of total idleness.. loved sewing bee, black history programmes, a house through time, and that ridiculous J Lion thingy on Netflix at the beginning of lockdown. Reruns of familiar books or series. Safety stuff. Also read Ann Prachett The Dutch house -I loved and factfulness to keep me sane, Georgette Heyer, Nagio Marsh and Dorothy L Sayers, Cabin Pressure (John Finnemore) silly videos of people in lockdown. For sanity in the numbers Radio 4.s More or Less is unbeaten facts and detail. Old Desert Island Discs. Podcasts, Fortunately -Jane Garvey and Fi Glover, Katherine Ryan, various others. Tonight bat watching more wildlife watching studying landscape and seasons as we walk the dog twice a day. Learning more plants and a bit of low level eco action preventing gather verges from being mowed and identifying the species and hedgerow condition. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? No not really. I suppose less occasion to wear make up. I get dressed to walk the dog so have to get up which is good I think. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. P and I have had vivid dreams and I have always had the odd insomnia night -i listen to audiobooks and go with it. Not much different to normal that I recall. P has definitely had more vivid dreams than I have and can recall them, whereas mine dissolve as I wake i think.

However, since our last Directive in autumn 2020, the NHS has been delivering a large-scale vaccination programme. It seems as if more and more people that we know are receiving the vaccinations. In Part.3 we would like you to share your thoughts on the vaccine. Some prompts for you to consider are below, but we welcome wider comments on the COVID-19 vaccine and wider vaccination programmes. If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I was booked in with the NHS on 15th March for the 28th March â€“ the first available date. Then I got a mail from my Dad, who had been contacted via the York Rowing Club mail. This mail, from a member of YCRC who is also a GP, said his wife was at the vaccine centre and they had more vaccine than people that day â€“ did anyone know anyone over 50? So, I went online again and tried to book via the NHS, but the new first available was 24th March â€“ so I booked that anyway. Then I remembered that I had had another link sent through by NIMBUS, the local GP practices (after I had booked through NHS). I looked at the link and it said it would expire in 3 days â€“ it was a week old. But, I thought I would try the link anyway, and it worked! So, 40 mins later I cycled up the road and had the 1st vaccine â€“ this was 21st March. I did pause briefly as the NHS version let one book two doses at once, but NIMBUS was just the first dose. So, I phoned my Dad, as my husband wasnâ€™t around, as I just needed to sound out with someone else (being an extrovert!). I decided to go with the week GP offer, a week earlier. But all this only came about as I heard about the spare vaccines that day! So, it was Askham Bar, York, by the GP consortium NIMBUS. It was quiet, immediate and dead friendly and I went by bike. For my second dose I had not heard from NIMBUS, so I went on the NHS site and they were allowing second dose only bookings, so I did it via that. So, second dose on 27th May. Same experience. Same place â€“ just the blue side not the red side this time! Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) S7094 Oxford AZ How did you feel after the vaccine?

Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs.

If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? I was contacted by my GP a week beforehand. I walked the short distance to the session which was held in the gym of the local school, where it was administered by local GPs. The queues were admirably marshalled by cheerful volunteers. It was an opportunity to see neighbours whom I had not seen for weeks. After everything I had read about the total shambles the NHS has been reduced to, I was amazed and impressed. Which vaccine did you receive? Pfizer â€“ not that I was offered a choice. How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects?

Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.  My husband and I are part of the Covid-19 infection survey project run by the Office for  National Statistics with IQVIA. Our general information comes from here, and also from the press. We were tested once a week for a month, and now once a month. We provide a H7108 nose and throat swab. Rather to our surprise, we get a Â£25 gift token each time. I think we were contacted because we belong to Biobank UK. My husband will take part in a further routine involving a capillary blood sample. I am not eligible for this as I take blood thinners. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. This seems to be thought a touchy question. There are and always have been countries which for public health reasons, require proof of vaccination â€“ for typhoid, smallpox etc and this has not caused any furore in the past. If boarding a plane or entry to a football match or rock concert were made conditional on proof of vaccination, many people would re-consider an anti-vax position.

If you have had a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Please describe your experience of going to get the vaccine. Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? My first vaccine was on 31st March. I drove to a local leisure centre a couple of miles away. It felt a bit like going to vote â€“ all those people clearly coming to this location for this one purpose, and trying to do something for their own and the collective good. Also the leisure centre gets used as a polling station. I had expected queues but in reality only queued for a couple of minutes. There were loads of marshals wearing high-viz jackets, showing you where to stand, giving out info leaflets. Someone at a reception desk checked my name and address, then I queued again. I thought I recognised an acquaintance in the queue behind me â€“ but because of masks, I wasnâ€™t When it was my turn to be vaccinated I went into a little booth and a young person in uniform again checked my details, talked me through the possible side effects, got me to sign a consent form, jabbed me and gave me a record card. Then I drove off to an unfamiliar Tesco in search of the very specific chocolate orange Easter egg my daughter had requested. (Eventually found one, a bit battered.) It felt odd to be driving round with the vaccine inside me, as if something should feel different but didnâ€™t â€“ yet â€¦ My second vaccine was on 14th June and in a different location at the Cardiff Bay vaccination centre, formerly Toys â€˜Râ€™ Us so now, inevitably, â€˜Jabs â€˜Râ€™ Us. Again, I drove. This was a much larger and much emptier building than the first jab at the leisure centre. The whole interior was white, so there was a slightly sci-fi atmosphere. Numerous chairs set out in a socially distanced way, but nobody sitting on them. It was like being on the set of a Stanley Kubrick film. This time I didnâ€™t have to wait at all â€“ gave my personal details at reception, followed arrows on the floor, turned round to eyeball a woman who was coming up behind me a bit too close (â€˜Sorry,â€™ she said and backed off) and was straight away beckoned into a booth by a woman in blue uniform. In the booth there was another woman in a green uniform who smiled and introduced herself by name. She seemed to be showing the other woman how to log everything on the computer.  So again, I was asked questions, but it was a bit slower because green woman was talking blue woman through the various drop-down menus. At Spring Directive 2021 MO P7209    Part 3: The Covid-19 Vaccine Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. one point she said â€˜And you have to ask to see the vaccination card becauseâ€™ [lowering her address] â€˜apparently some people lie â€¦â€™  While blue woman was inputting data, green woman also made small talk with me and I sympathised about the heat. A third, purple-uniformed woman turned up and joined in the chat. She smiled at me. â€˜All done and dusted?â€™ she said. I said, â€˜No, I havenâ€™t had it yet.â€™ But eventually blue woman gave me the jab. â€˜No blood,â€™ she said, with satisfaction. Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) Oxford AstraZeneca, both times. How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? Initially I felt fine, just a slightly sore arm. Both times, the following day I felt as if I had a slightly altered consciousness â€“ slightly detached, a bit spaced-out. Approx. 24 hours after both jabs I felt exhausted, totally overwhelmed by fatigue, and had to lie down for a little nap in the middle of the afternoon, something Iâ€™d never normally do. These were my only side effects. Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? Definitely trying to socially distance, and wearing a mask when indoors. I am definitely not staying at home. I feel we need, cautiously and carefully, to open up. Iâ€™ve been going to church; have taken daughters on non-essential shopping trips; took older daughter to see a prospective university and stayed in an Airbnb; with a friend, attended a beautiful live piano recital by Mitsuko Uchida.  Travelled to the latter by train and was a bit put out to see some people not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly. Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? I trust the scientists and doctors who are saying itâ€™s safer than getting Covid. I have some tiny, residual worries about the fact that itâ€™s been rushed through. Tiny, residual worries about my daughters receiving the vaccine. But I think my tiny worries are within the spectrum of normal worries. Spring Directive 2021 MO P7209    Part 3: The Covid-19 Vaccine Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). In Wales, people have been contacted by letter and text and given their appointments in order of priority. The system in Wales has been different from England, where people have been able to book their own appointment. Some English friends on a Zoom call put the wind up me by telling me I should be booking my own appointment. They were wrong. I am mildly annoyed that people in England seem mostly unaware that NHSWales and the Welsh Government do things differently. We are extremely proud of the way Wales has handled the vaccination programme. Drakeford and Vaughan Gething the (until very recently) Health minister have done a very good job in my opinion. Wales leads the world.  Matt Hancock, the English Health secretary and serial liar, claimed that Wales were only able to speed ahead with the programme because we had English stocks of vaccine as a â€˜bufferâ€™. He is such a liar. Wales have succeeded because of careful management of stocks and roll-out; we havenâ€™t stockpiled â€˜spareâ€™ vaccines and have calculated the risk of running out. I have been aware that HC professionals, care workers and vulnerable people have been prioritized and this was the right thing to do. Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine.  Websites such as the Welsh Govt. website; BBC news; the Guardian; NHS Wales info leaflets. Spring Directive 2021 MO P7209    Part 3: The Covid-19 Vaccine Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both Covid-19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. This is difficult. 20-odd years ago, planning a research trip to Tanzania and Zanzibar, I found out that I couldnâ€™t get onto Zanzibar without an up to date Yellow Fever vaccine, which would cost Â£30. I got the vaccine. I remember seeing people on the ferry having to show their certificates, and the official telling one couple that they wouldnâ€™t be allowed to disembark because they hadnâ€™t had the vaccine. At the time this seemed eminently sensible and I didnâ€™t see it as an infringement of human rights. So I kind of feel that theyâ€™re already a feature of foreign travel. However, within the UK Iâ€™m not so sure. Vaccine passports for pubs etc could cause so much aggro, and intensify the divisions that already exist.  Currently various large-scale events, e.g. concerts and sports, are being piloted to see what happens to infection levels, and it appears to look pretty good. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? I donâ€™t know!"

Since the beginning of the pandemic I have logged on every day and in spring 2020 I reported a slight cold and was asked to take a test. I took it very seriously, ordered the test over the internet and isolated until it arrived. It wasn't difficult to administer but it isn't a pleasant process. I have speeded up with more experience and lay everything out, remember not to clean my teeth or take my medication on the morning before I do it and 50% of the time I have remembered to post the result on the NHS website.I found that the nearest post box had only one collection a day, at 9am, so I had to speed up the process. The reply came in 3/4 days and was negative as expected.In 20211 ordered a set of 7 lateral flow tests, but before that I wanted to be clear before looking after my granddaughter so I had a PCR test in Aylesbury on a Sunday morning, and had the result on my phone before I arrived home.So far I have used 6 of the lateral flow tests, making 8 tests in all. I started testing twice a week but as restrictions relaxed and I had been double vaxed I had a long gap. However recently my granddaughter caught Covid from her mother, who I had seen for a couple of minutes while infectious, so I wanted to confirm that I was clear before I saw the clinically vulnerable husband of a friend. I was negative. I will probably get another set of 7 tests so that I can check periodically, or after exposure to large groups. From today there is no need for double vaccinated people like me to isolate if in contact with someone with Covid but I will probably comply by have an optional PCR test. The pinging in August was a problem, so while I still logged on when I visited public places I switched off the app. I test to confirm that I am not a risk to other people. I am aware that I can be an asymptomatic carrier. I have done blood tests with a lancet before and I find them much easier. I have definitely been put off foreign travel by the cost, uncertainty and complications of testing, but I am going to Israel in November and I expect to be test free in both directions. I am still wearing a mask in shops, libraries, public transport etc, although it is voluntary.Where to start on the government Test and Trace service! The cost is greater than the entire cost of furlough, it has never worked effectively, they employed low skilled people and gave inadequate training and it has been a monumental failure. The only good thing to emerge is that Dido Harding was not appointed to succeed Sir Simon Stevens as head of the NHS! It fits into the pattern of contracts been given to government cronies and private testing for travel being inefficient and overpriced. As you can see I am not a fan of the government response.Like any self administered test the accuracy will partly rely on the competence of the person doing the test. I am sure that I have not yet had covid, so I believe the tests have been accurate in my case."

Friends were telling me a week ahead that the NHS website was accepting applications but I thought this was queue jumping so I waited. It transpires that when you enter your age you can't proceed unless you fall into the appropriate age group or are a carer, so my high mindedness was ill placed! I didn't wait for my GP to contact me and so I drove to High Wycombe and had the AZ vaccine at a pharmacy. I booked the second appointment at the same time so I know exactly when that is taking place. I would have had to drive to my GP so I didn't feel I was driving unnecessarily. I arrived early, was ushered straight in and it was swift and efficient. I had no side effects whatsoever, not even a sore arm. I got the GP invitation later and I rang to cancel. Although it would have been slightly nearer I wanted the first injection as soon as possible as I was going to look after my 10 year old granddaughter over half term and wanted the protection. She had been out of school for 10 days when I went to cover the second week of the holiday so I felt pretty safe, and I was 12 days post vaccination so presumably I had some cover. Since then I have looked after her during the Easter holidays. By the time I go for summer half term I will have been more than 3 weeks beyond the second injection and as protected as I will be before boosters in September. My son will also have had his first injection by then.On Monday 29th March I had a hospital appointment and I stopped by at my cousin's on the way back and took advantage of being able to have coffee in the garden. That week I also walked with a friend and we then were able to have a drink in her garden. Since then I have been walking in groups of up to 6 and also having coffee on the recreation area with 5 others. I wear a mask wherever it's required and keep to the rules with one exception. My next door neighbour has dementia and I have heard increased shouting from them. I reported it to adult social care but it is still very difficult. As a result since 29th March I have invited her and as it's too cold to sit outdoors she's come inside but keeping least 2 metres distant. I feel that her safety and wellbeing justifies this and she has had both injections. I guess other factors include the incredibly low infection rates locally. I'm in a support bubble with my daughter who is also single and in a childcare bubble with my single parent son. I think the concept of support bubbles is good and I take advantage of it, but both children are going to work so it isn't 100% safe. As far as we could work out, support bubbles can't all meet at the same time, so I spent Christmas and Easter alone and they were together, but at Easter they met friends in Dorset and there were multiple children and at least 3 families. Although sticking to the rules I noticed that the 5 of us walking in Tuesday were never 2 metres apart, and the neighbour I waslitter-picking with over the weekend was often at my side, so I think 2 meters outside just doesn'twork.All the adverse AstraZeneca publicity has made me a little apprehensive about the second injection. My daughter has a clotting disorder so this had been a source of concern. I'm thrilled and relieved that her GP has agreed that she should wait a fortnight and have the Pfizer vaccine.Since Monday pubs and cafes have opened but I haven't changed my routine and I think this is likely to continue. However in Bristol last week my granddaughter and I bought take away drinks and cake every day on our outings. It costs a fortune!ILocally GP surgeries seem to be lagging behind the NHS rollout. Some are using their own premises but there is also a centre at the Town Hall in Chesham. I have had 2 Covid tests. I take part in research via the ZOE App and back in September when I reported a cold I was asked to take a test. It arrived in a couple of days and I isolated for another 4 until the result came through. It was negative which was what I expected. Before my half term visit to Bristol I had a rapid flow test in Aylesbury and that was also negative.I think the news reporting is accurate but as most of us know little about statistics, we see responses Europe wide, and it comes across as negative for AZ. It has become very political and I worry about vaccine poverty, since this is a worldwide pandemic, so no one is safe until the majority is protected.I think a vaccine passport for travel, theatres, cinemas and galleries is a good idea. I think it is unworkable in pubs. I have a trip booked to the Lebanon in late September that I think is unlikely to take place, and I hope maybe to travel to Austria by train in December. I'd happily have a passport if it enabled me to stay in Airbnb for a proposed road trip in the summer. It isn't entirely fair but neither is the virus or society at large so I can live with it. I would have reservations about sharing an aircraft cabin with unvaccinated fellow passengers. I have chosen not to return to church until late May, but I happily go to shops and garden centres. I feel each of us has a risk threshold and we have to stick to that provided it's more or less in line with guidelines. I look out over our local park/recreation area and large numbers are not sticking to the rules but they are in the open air and it is holiday time and we have to consider mental health issues and being able to have social contact.I feel that it is reasonable for care or health workers to be required to have a vaccination as a condition of employment. I have had surgery and ongoing treatment in 2 different hospitals since March last year and I've felt very safe and have not had any ill effects. My daughter has had Covid and she suffers from long Covid. It is sobering to see a young woman who has run a marathon and climbed Kilimanjaro suffer breathing difficulties and fatigue. I think we are going to be living with the consequences of the pandemic for a long time. Living in isolation for so long I think my verbal communication skills have suffered, and I think I fear large gatherings. I've always been happier in small groups and I think this has been exacerbated.'"

The site is over two miles from my house; I no longer have a car, and felt that it was too far to walk there and back given my current level of unfitness, with the uncertainty of possible side effects, so a friend drove me for the first dose, and a volunteer driver from York Wheels, a charitable organisation based at the hospital, delivered me for the second, waited for me and took me home, for which I was very grateful. I had a rather anxious wait for my letter, with people younger than me crowing that they had been summoned by text which I do not use, but once it arrived I found the booking process straightforward even for a technophobe like me. Portakabins hosted the different vaccines and volunteer marshals directed people and traffic efficiently and cheerfully, even in snow and biting wind. The vaccination procedure itself was well organised, with short, well-spaced queues moving quickly. I was directed to a cubicle where an administrator checked my details and issued the paperwork, and a medic of some description carried out the vaccination. I had the Oxford vaccine so was not required to wait. I had no ill effects apart from a slight headache and tiredness for a day or two, which I used as an excuse to lie on the sofa and read a book. I cannot overstate how grateful I felt for having been looked after so well. I had no hesitation in being vaccinated. In the course of more than seventy years I have had every vaccine available to me for home-grown diseases. In the late 1930s my motherâ€™s eldest sister contracted diphtheria, then a dreadful scourge, was hospitalised and 1 almost died, so it was inevitable that I would be vaccinated as a baby. When I was growing up in the 1950s poliomyelitis was rife; I was not allowed into crowded places like swimming pools in summer for fear of infection, and developed a horror of the â€˜iron lungâ€™ respirators then in use. My vaccination in 1956 came as a great relief. Most recently, once I became eligible at seventy for the pneumonia and shingles vaccinations, I took advantage; I have never forgotten my uncleâ€™s severe attack of shingles over his scalp and forehead and into one eye shortly after his retirement, and the immediate and long-term pain he suffered. Perhaps those who reject vaccination have had fewer opportunities to understand the ravages of such diseases. Of course, one knows that there are potential risks. I avoid news media as much as possible so have perhaps escaped the worst of the scaremongering, but for me the risk of contracting the virus was significantly greater than that posed by the vaccine. I realise that vaccination does not offer complete protection and that immunity wanes with time, but because it is likely to reduce both the severity of the infection and transmission I have felt able to engage more with the world as restrictions have gradually been lifted. I still have goods delivered on a regular basis, but I occasionally visit a large supermarket where there is plenty of space. I undertake necessary work in my house by responsible firms. I feel reasonably comfortable attending appointments, for example with the nurse for an asthma review, or the chiropodist, or the optician, or the hairdresser. I avoid crowded places and public transport, and have no desire to visit cafÃ©s or to invite guests into my house. I continue to wear a mask and expect workmen coming into my house to do so â€“ which so far has not been a problem. I am far less comfortable now that mask-wearing has become optional. I regard the easing of the regulation on mask-wearing as a mistake, because most of us had grown used to it and, however limited the protection offered, it has surely helped reduce transmission and allowed many people to feel more confident. I doubt if it would now be possible to reverse 2 that decision. The legends on some of the buses recommend rather than require mask-wearing, which makes me wary of using them. I have been in the habit of visiting a local Marks and Spencer food hall every week or two and have felt quite safe in doing so with precautions in place. However, last week I found that whereas all the other customers I encountered were wearing masks, none of the staff was doing so; there was hand sanitiser available, but I was not sure that the trolleys had been sanitised; and the one-way system which had previously been in operation seemed to have evaporated. I felt quite anxious. This week I visited Waitrose which has been consistently meticulous in taking safety precautions; here the trolleys were being sanitised and transferred to the â€˜cleanâ€™ bay as I arrived, and most, not all, of the staff were wearing masks, but as I was loading up my bike I noticed two customers in succession returning their trolleys to the â€˜cleanâ€™ rather than the â€˜usedâ€™ bay. I understand that there is only a limited risk of acquiring the virus from a surface as opposed to droplets, but actually I have valued the sanitising of equipment as a matter of basic hygiene. People seem to me to have become too relaxed and careless of the safety of others, and cynically I think it folly to place too great a trust in their common sense and sense of social responsibility. Perhaps my anxiety will lessen as time goes on, as more people are vaccinated and boosters perhaps become available, but I have become adapted to restrictions and at present I do not foresee extending my range of activities and social contacts. If properly monitored â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™ were to be introduced as a means of protecting the wider population, they would probably not impinge on my life as I do not travel or attend the venues currently under consideration, but if in due course they were to be extended, perhaps to trains, I would see no reason to object. 3"

I am a Training Officer working in public transport. Spring 2020 Directive – Covid 19 The world is indeed a very different place to what we are used to in the middle of the Covid 19 pandemic. This directive was written late May / early June 2020 and already in the UK there have been over 41,000 deaths with a daily death toll, which, whilst reducing slightly is still too high to consider reducing precautions. It is extremely concerning for everyone and at the time of writing this I am “shielding” which means that I must stay at home for 12 weeks, only going outdoors for exercise and keeping well away from crowded places. This is because I am asthmatic and therefore susceptible to contracting the virus in a more severe form. This has put added pressure on our household as I have two sons at home who are both classed as keyworkers. They are normally employed in the public transport industry; however, all the local authorities of Greater Manchester are working together to undertake any tasks that are needed. Therefore, they have been involved in activities outside of their usual ones, such as helping to set up the Nightingale Hospital in April and delivering PPE to hospitals across the region. Whilst we are all worried and are taking the utmost precautions, I do not feel that this has affected our mental health as a family. We are lucky in that my husband is fully retired and I work part time and have been able to work from home throughout the crisis. My employers closed our offices on 18th March (whilst I was on holiday) and almost all staff have been working from home consistently from this date. My employers have furloughed some staff with their full agreement, but this has not applied to my role. We have been provided with laptops at home plus any other equipment we need. Office furniture was offered to anyone who doesn’t have such facilities at home to work comfortably (i.e. desks and chairs). Before Covid 19, we had been moving towards laptops and hotdesking so the changes to cope with the crisis were partially in place. We have meetings via Microsoft Teams and have Skype to “chat” to colleagues. It is all working perfectly in the Department we are in and there have already been talks to suggest that we may never revert to all staff being in the office together after the crisis. On a personal level, I am very sociable and already used Facebook, Facetime, What’s App etc to keep up with family and friends, We live in Manchester and all my husband’s family are in Hampshire so we “speak” regularly via these applications and did so long before Covid. My cousin in Oxfordshire is very similar to me and sees the importance of maintaining contact throughout this crisis. She introduced me to Zoom and we have a family chat via this method every fortnight (which is more often than we would normally be in touch!) and this can involve up to seven households. I think this is something which will remain. I have set up other groups with friends and other branches of the family and again we are in touch just as often, if not more, than we would be without the crisis. I want to “learn” Twitter but haven’t done yet, but it is an objective for some spare time during this crisis. We are very lucky in that we don’t have any financial worries and we live in a house with a pleasant garden. We have a large allotment nearby where we can spend a lot of time and we grow a great deal of our own produce. The weather throughout the pandemic has been for the most part glorious and because we have been able to get out without the risk of meeting other people, we have been able to deal with the restrictions more easily than some. My husband has spent a great deal of time at the allotment, we have grown early crops (helped by the weather) that we may not otherwise have done. We have extended our allotment as a person wanted to give up some of theirs, so this has been a great use of time. I have set myself some targets for the time spent in lockdown, taking up writing on a more formal level (including applying to write for Mass Observation!) and pulling together our travel blogs so that we can have them made into photo books. I have a target of learning to crochet as I have never mastered this craft and have wanted to do so for many years. I am also knitting and sewing as we have another grandchild expected in October. Personally, although we have spent more money in Supermarkets as we are buying treats more often, buying a few more bottles of wine to compensate for not going out and buying far more baking ingredients than we would normally, I have not spent anything like the amount of money that I would have spent under normal circumstances. The reason being that we are not going out to lunch with friends, we are not travelling to Hampshire as we usually do on a monthly basis to see our family and grandchildren, we are not eating out as a couple or a family as we would normally. I have therefore used Amazon etc to send “cheer up” gifts to family and friends, sent books to our younger grandchildren and great-nephews. I found some little wooden heart shaped “pocket hugs” on the internet to send to older grandchildren, family and friends that I am missing. I have also sent postcards and written letters when I would normally pick up the phone or send an email but have continued to do that too. My Mum is 88, luckily very local and although my sister has been doing her shopping, I have been baking regularly (almost daily!) and taking something around as a treat. Her grandchildren have bought her jigsaws, been to see her (standing in her garden) and we are taking her the occasional meal. Because we feel that we are abiding by all the rules we have made sure that she gets out walking every day and, on some afternoons, she comes and sits in either my garden or my sisters garden and we have coffee and cake whilst maintaining social distancing. Mum has been very stoical throughout this, not complaining at all, she just wants to get out of the crisis in good health and with all her family intact, she enjoys TV, crosswords, sudoku and anything else that keeps her brain active and she is coping well. Whilst I feel anxious about my sons bringing the virus home and am paranoid about cleanliness in the home, washing their work clothes everyday as soon as they arrive home, including hi-vis jackets which would usually only be washed weekly, I also feel lucky that we can look after ourselves in this way. As I am not attending my workplace I have been in very casual clothes (including, I am afraid to say, Pyjamas on some of the early days!). Personal hygiene has not lapsed in any way as we are a whole household who love a bath rather than a shower, so a bath is now a daily, long, leisurely affair for all of us to kill some time at some point in the day. But other personal routines have lapsed, I can’t get to the hairdresser, so my hair is no longer “styled”, and I have not used my makeup bag for over two months! I am wearing the same clothes on a regular basis, just washing them and wearing again as I am not really going anywhere other than to the allotment and the local park to cycle or walk. My sleep patterns have altered as we all tend to go to bed earlier now than we would in normal times. My sons are probably not asleep but playing computer games with friends or chatting on social media which is a similar situation for my husband and me. We are probably on our phones far more than is healthy, chatting to friends, following the news, reading newspapers, reading books on my Kindle, following Facebook, texting etc. I have “enjoyed” Facebook, there have been interesting posts and challenges, I have been asked by friends to post photos that mean a lot to me either family wise or travel based, and for a bit of fun I was asked to share what influenced my taste in music. I have benefitted enormously from social media use to reduce any stresses that may exist. I have a general interest in history, particularly local and family history and have been researching this. I have posted some findings on Facebook to be seen by family and friends with photos and have had some positive responses which has been lovely. I have spent more time reading, downloading books to my kindle and am definitely watching less TV. The latest book that I have read was “Beyond Peterloo” charting the life of Elijah Dixon a local man who spent his life fighting for the rights of the poor. I have been baking, learning to crochet, knitting, sewing, walking, cycling. I have done some jobs that I have put off for some time (sorting out the loft!) and have a list of tasks still to be done. Decorating is on the list but has not started as the weather has been too good to stay indoors but if this was to change as the lockdown continues then we would start to decorate. I can see amongst my extended family and friends that it is more difficult for some of them. I have other friends and family who are furloughed, and some are on reduced incomes and are not finding it easy. My sister is home schooling her 13-year-old son, who isn’t enjoying being separated from his friends and is often playing up when he is asked to complete his schoolwork in the home environment. Although this sounds trivial, when it is day after day with a moody teenager it does take its toll. My sister’s employer isn’t stepping up to the mark to make working from home a viable option for some of the employees so at the current time she is taking sickness leave as she cannot leave her son for prolonged periods as no schoolwork would get done. Luckily, we live next door to each other, and she can talk to me and talk through any issues and is not as alone as she would otherwise be as a single parent. At the current time I am not aware of anyone who has needed medical or professional help. Covid 19 has widened my experience of friendships and how fragile they can become when faced with opposing opinions and/or mounting stress. I have kept in touch with many colleagues over the years despite our career paths changing. I made a friend in 1976 and have kept in touch at Christmas time and birthdays but since I took flexible retirement, we have seen much more of this couple and enjoyed many days out, lunches, evening meals, weekends away etc. M and his wife are staunch Tories and we are not, and we have previously had light-hearted banter about our respective politics which hasn’t until now affected our relationship. In our eyes (although never voiced) their politics are about “them” and how everything will affect “them”, whereas we see our beliefs to be more widely encompassing and view politics by how it will affect much more than just us. Now in their 70’s they have a nice lifestyle, but do not travel widely anymore because of health issues (diabetes). They have travelled in the past within Europe and once to Australia and New Zealand but never Asia as they “never fancied it”. They remarked when we were going to India on holiday (and about previous holidays we have had in Asia) that they couldn’t go to these countries because of the poor hygiene, spicy food and the violence of the people (??). They tend to believe safety is an issue simply because the people are poor. We have previously brushed off these comments with tales of our thoroughly positive experiences over ten years of Asian travel. However during this crisis our political beliefs being polar opposite brought on a situation that has caused the end of the friendship and I am still reeling with disbelief that in this day and age people can take such exception to the opinions of others. I now have a much greater understanding of how the actions of a few can cause a mutiny and how those few can very easily be ordinary people!. I have been saddened by this (but not to a point where I would want to resurrect a friendship which is clearly past its sell by date). M had been in touch with us during our holiday, via What’s App to say that “he hoped we had arrived OK in India and were safe” but again laboured the point “we wouldn’t have gone” and did we know “there had been a murder in Delhi ” which was 1,700 miles from where we were in Kerala!! We responded that there had probably been several murders in London, but he was, as relatively safe in , as we were in Kerala. Again, light-hearted banter but getting the point across. The next message was “hope you are still OK. Isn’t Boris doing a marvellous job?” a subject matter where he was fully aware that we may have an opposing view. So, I decided to ignore that one, and the next one, and then we came to a decision not to look at What’s App messages and to enjoy the rest of our holiday without the negativity and as we were travelling we really didn’t have the time to enter into pointless banter. I always blog our holidays on Facebook along with photos, for my Mum who loves to know what we are doing each day. Almost daily there were comments from M, not always positive, saying “we wouldn’t have done … ” whatever it was we had done that day or the day before … but always ending, “but we hope you are having a nice time”. Upon our return we scanned the queue of messages in What’s App which were mostly in the same vein about ”how great Boris was doing” and a welcome home one which said “I bet you are so relieved to be back from that place”. I really felt saddened that he didn’t understand the country at all but still felt it was OK to make derogatory comments and so felt I had to respond. My response included what precautions had been present in India, which I knew hadn’t applied in the UK, my opinions of what Boris was doing or more to the point what he had failed to do such as: block large events such as Cheltenham, attend several COBRA meetings, shake hands with people which belittled the severity of the crisis, procure PPE more effectively, provide adequate testing, report honestly on death tolls across care homes etc. I explained that we had felt safer in India and had felt the situation was being dealt with much more proactively there and now back in the UK we felt very anxious and unsafe. I received a response advising that he was “a loyal Tory” (which I think we had guessed!) and “patriotic to his country” and our opinions of “our wonderful country” were “disgusting and foul” and that forthwith he was “blocking us on Facebook” (at this point, my feelings were quite honestly, thank goodness!!). To cap it all, minutes after the blocking, he used the page of a mutual friend to say that he had had to BLOCK (in upper case, to emphasise the matter!) old friends “because of their politics in the current climate” and that they were “disgusting and foul”. I did write one final message and sent via email to advise that we were not disgusting and foul, as he well knew, or we wouldn’t have been friends for so long. I reminded him that we care about the wider community and the world (but managed to refrain from saying that in our eyes he didn’t) and I ended by saying I thought it was a sad to end a friendship because of politics but that we were happy to accept his decision and we wished them both well.  I was infuriated by the suggestion that we are disgusting, thinking this somewhat harsh as we are far from that and he knows as such. When it came into conversation once that we financially support, on a monthly basis, the education of a young girl in Sri Lanka who hopes to become a doctor but couldn’t afford to travel from her village to a place where she would get a better education in the city, he commented that we could have helped a UK cause. I doubt he would ever consider giving to a charitable cause that assists people outside the UK. Overall his comments were completely unfounded and initially it was upsetting to a degree. However, we are now of the opinion that his friendship is not much of a loss to our social lives and we can easily cope without the far right political banter. It has however made me more aware of how sensitive people can be and how they can have an allegiance to people in power that they put above family and friends. I find that bizarre. The Government – I think the political decisions have all been too little, too late and the handling of the pandemic abysmal in the extreme. When the severity of the virus was initially being recognised in early March 2020, we were on a three-week holiday touring Southern India. We had checked the Foreign Office information extensively before we left the UK at the end of February and there was no restriction on travel, so we left and had a wonderful holiday. This was marred only by what we were reading about “back home” and by wondering if we were going to get home easily and what we would be returning home to. We were extremely lucky that throughout our holiday we were getting information from our airline to confirm that our flights remained on schedule (while most around us were receiving cancelled flight information and were having to re-book). In India (the state of Kerala) the preventative measures in place were far superior to those our family and friends were reporting in the UK. We stayed in five hotels and on a houseboat whilst we were there and in every one, on arrival we had to complete a health questionnaire and sit in a Reception area and be observed for two hours before we were allowed to use the facilities and be shown to our rooms. One of our hosts explained afterwards that had we shown any symptoms of being unwell, coughing, temperature, etc we would have been immediately transferred to a quarantine hotel and had to remain there for 14 days. Supermarkets in India are obviously not on the scale of UK ones and are just large “corner shops” but only two people were allowed in at any time and there were washing facilities outside and hand sanitiser and you had to obey the rules. I was so impressed with what they were doing. At the time of writing this twelve weeks later, the UK is STILL not taking any similar actions regarding foreign visitors. Some quarantine measures will be introduced in the next few days but are so airy fairy and difficult to follow up that it is now almost pointless. We flew home from Kerala airport where the army were in charge, army officials took our temperature on arrival before entering the complex, the airport lounges were divided up so that no-one sat within three rows of seating of another person, and it “felt safe”. The army were present to monitor adherence (although I agree that we could have been asymptomatic and fell ill up to two weeks later) but at least they had policies in place, and these were without doubt encouraging sensible behaviour. In the UK press (The Guardian, 14 May 2020) the Indian state of Kerala had had 524 cases and only 4 deaths. The state spans over 15,000 sq. miles and has quite a dense population of 33 million. By comparison the whole of the UK has a population of 66 million and as at the same time the statistics stand at 237,000 cases of infection and 35,000 deaths with an admittance that the death toll is “probably much higher” as there is little clarity surrounding deaths in care homes. Our stopover at Abu Dhabi followed much of the same rules as in India but on reaching the UK there was absolutely nothing in place. We decided not to join the queues (as there no social distancing in place AT ALL) for passport control and sat and waited until the area was clear before going through passport control. I actually asked an immigration officer at Manchester what steps we needed to take now back in the UK and he very clearly told me that I had nothing to worry about and having flown in from India there was no requirement for quarantine. I totally accept that this pandemic would have been a challenge to any Government, and not rating Jeremy Corbyn it would have been an equal challenge to the opposition. Indeed, it has been to Governments across the world. However, the UK has unfortunately witnessed some catastrophic mistakes made by our cabinet led by Boris Johnson. I outlined these above as the high profile events taking place, missing five COBRA meetings, shaking hands, lack of PPE, testing inadequacies and the care homes issue and in my mind a lack of transparency when dealing with Scientists, SAGE, medical professionals and local councils. I think this is not now going unnoticed (thank goodness). Later in the month of May there was the Dominic Cummings fiasco, he ignored lockdown rules and travelled with his family to Durham and whilst stupid more than illegal it set a precedent that rules did not apply to all. I despair and feel a total lack of trust towards Boris Johnson and his Ministers and it is becoming clear that other leaders feel the same way. We are seeing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to follow suit in both the relaxation of lockdown and the decisions around children returning to school. Local Education Authorities in England are now deciding for themselves and not following guidance laid down by the Government. To be fair I also have decided not to follow any Government guidance as what I am doing, in my opinion, is safer than what is proposed. I do think and hope that Keir Starmer would make a much better leader than Boris Johnson and hope that at the next election he will have a chance. I am following the daily afternoon briefings. I have been frustrated by the inability of the speakers to answer some of the questions. I have also been frustrated by the questions that have been asked, many of which have been repetitive and futile. The Government cannot provide a response for every family scenario and there has to be some common sense applied but this has been made all the more difficult by the guidance which has been so open to interpretation and lacked clarity far more than it should have from the very beginning and the media whose behaviour and coverage of the crisis has been utterly dreadful. The news and updates should be open to all and there are subtitles but BSL should also be used to convey the message to those who need it. I cannot see, as this situation continues, that it will become anything other than a political point scoring exercise with compassion and the safety of the nation falling by the wayside. I recognise that the economy is hugely important and needs to start returning to some state of normality. I understand that BREXIT is an all consuming passion for this Government too but it is very clear that they cannot multi task and at the current time everything should be shelved until we have this virus under control and the deaths are minimal. Now is not the time to concentrate efforts on other agendas. I think Government reactions to advice need to be more timely and honest in respect of the virus, the R rate is still not under 1.0, we do not have a robust test, trace and isolate system. Boris Johnson is showing on a daily basis how out of his depth he is in a crisis, he does not have the integrity to hold down such a strategic post. His character is one of laziness, banter and slogans, arrogance, lies and deceit. What the Government needs at a time like this is accountability, integrity, honesty, compassion, credibility and commitment. Boris has none of these characteristics and there are now flaws and breakdowns within his own party when what should be happening is utilisation of the skills of all professionals, regardless of rank and party to address the crisis in which we find ourselves. I am very worried about how this will roll on and what will happen to the nation under such weak leadership, it is unprecedented."

My first dose was in early February and the second in May. When we went for our first dose we only had a short walk to a local community centre which is within the grounds of our local upper school. When we went inside there was a bit of a party atmosphere in the centre. Everyone was very good natured about the queuing and there was a lot of laughter, jokes were being cracked both outside the centre and inside where the administration was being done. The place was awash with volunteers!  We were directed at every turn, including at the beginning of a corridor and at the end of the same corridor â€“ it was all of 5 metres long. You couldnâ€™t have got lost if you had tried. The centre where I was vaccinated was seeing 500 people a day. They had the number of doses they had administered written up on a large of a notice board and the whole organisation seemed to be running like clockwork. Because of the age group myself and my husband fall into we knew of 3 other couples with whom we are friendly who, coincidently, were being vaccinated at the same place and on the same day. We didnâ€™t meet any of our friends as we have different appointment times but there was lots of chat in telephone calls and whatsapps messages about each couple experience. Iâ€™ve noticed that on local Face book page that seemingly every 3 or 4 days that someone comments about their experience that day about their visit to the vaccination centre and immediately others follow suit describing their own experience. Every post I have seen has been congratulatory. Many are to thank the volunteers and NHS staff and saying what a great job everyone is doing.    I was worried about receiving the vaccine and do think about possible repercussions that might come in the future. We have no way of knowing what might lay ahead with the disease or the vaccination. One of my worries is knowing that there has been a rise in the number of people who were experiencing blood clots, and that there was a chance that this was linked to the Astra Zeneca vaccination. My fears were somewhat allayed when I read somewhere that the chance of such problems happening, because of the vaccination, was about the same as if I had travelled on a long haul flight. I suppose we need to educate ourselves that nothing is risk free! The vaccination was also developed so quickly which did make me wonder if corners had been cut in its development. Personally, I did not have any after affects after either vaccination and was rather surprised to hear of friends who were taking paracetamol after they had had their injections .... just in case they suffered! In my local area we have two centres for vaccinations. I thought there were two centres just so they could give vaccinations more quickly but I have been told that it is because one  is organised by the NHS and GPâ€™s surgeries and the other by local pharmacists -but I donâ€™t know if that is true. I have a friend who works for the NHS and she is working at one of our local centres, she implies that she is in charge of the whole event â€“ again, Iâ€™m not so sure that this is the case. She tells me that it is a really challenging thing to organise and she is often works without a break for many hours. They only have 3 minutes per patient and if this runs over then long queues build up. She also has several people working with her who are paid by the NHS â€“ they are all EasyJet employees but are on furlough because of the pandemic. My friend is not impressed by their work ethic! Whereas the volunteers she has are all willing to do an extra bit where necessary, the EasyJet people in comparison work strictly to the clock, take all their breaks and avoid doing anything if they can possibly avoid it! Vaccine Passports â€“ There are many people who think that carrying some sort of document or app on your phone to show that you have had vaccinations will help to ease us back to the situation we had before the pandemic. Whilst no travel restrictions and the freedom to attend large gatherings seem like desirable aims I cannot see this idea working at all. Practically it would add further stages to the process of attending any event, obtaining and then presenting the â€˜proofâ€™ so it can be checked somehow. We are told that anyone â€“ even those who have been vaccinated -can carry and transmit the virus without showing any symptoms so would a test have to be performed as well? Maybe in time for anyone planning foreign trips the vaccination will be a necessity for travelling to some countries in the same way that we are already advised to have typhoid and yellow fever injections. Even though Iâ€™ve had both vaccinations I still am aware that there is a risk â€“ mainly I think that I could still carry the virus and pass it on to others so I am still being quite cautious. We have been to see friends but sat in their garden. Likewise, when friends came to see us, we arranged chairs in the garden; I also assumed that they would cancel if the weather was poor. As it was weâ€™ve had really hot weather for several days in a row and everyone was more than happy to sit together â€“ but socially distanced, outside under a large tree. I put out hand sanitizer along with the cake! I am writing this in June and we are expecting that the plan to lift the final set of restrictions, which is due to happen very soon, may well be cancelled. I live near a virus hotspot where there are an increasing number of cases of the Indian (Delta) virus occurring. Iâ€™ve seen the figures and graphs on local web sites which show how the numbers of cases are rising. I overheard someone the other day asking a friend if they knew anywhere where they could get hold of a part they needed for a car â€“ the answer came quickly; it was the name of a garage which happens to be in the local hotspot town. â€˜Well I think I might wait a while before venturing there!â€™"

Thinking about one specific testing experience of your choice from beginning to end (e.g. why you got tested, your experience of undergoing testing, and how the test result impacted on your life and relationships), please can you tell us about that experience. We are interested in details of the whole testing process for example, interpreting symptoms, changing domestic/work plans, navigating an online booking system, , self-isolating and telling others about test results. I haven’t done much testing. I’m retired and during the main parts of the pandemic I didn’t have much contact with people, so I only took one PCR test, when I was flying back home from Portugal. Since then, we have had lateral flow tests in the house. We used them once, when we were going to see my husband’s daughter who had just returned from the US and was very very anxious about Covid. But the time I’m going to tell you about is more recent. Just a couple of weeks ago I had a day of feeling not very well at all. The kind of day when you might think you had a cold coming, in those pre-pandemic days. Of course, I was anxious that it might be Covid. I’d almost forgotten what it felt like to feel ‘under the weather’ which used to be such a regular part of life. So what I did was, I waited until my husband had gone out for a walk and then I did a lateral flow test in secret. I didn’t want to tell him I was feeling unwell because he’s as anxious about health issues as his daughter. I thought that if I said I was feeling unwell, he would immediately think that he was feeling unwell too – this always happens and annoys me unreasonably. And then we would both have to test, and he would make a big fuss about it, and I’d end up annoyed all over again. I knew what to do, it’s always me that reads the instructions, he’s 77 and finds it difficult to read the small print. So I quickly did it, out on the kitchen counter, shoved the wotsit up my nose and around my throat and waited for the allotted time and hoped it wouldn’t rain and bring him back early from his walk. And it was negative and all was fine and I threw the evidence away and didn’t tell anyone till now. M-O Number S7592 /Female /63 /Married /Shoreham by Sea/Retired Everyday testing . How many tests have you undergone for Covid-19 since the pandemic began? If possible, list the tests you have taken and anything you remember about the circumstances around them (e.g. What kinds of test were they? Why were you tested? What was happening in the pandemic at that time? And where did you have the test?) I’ve tested three times since the start of the pandemic: 1. In Portugal, at the end of January, to come home. It was a proper PCR test, quite uncomfortable and my nose hurt for days afterwards. The pandemic was raging, Portugal was in lockdown and we were racing home to beat hotel quarantine and also move into a new house. Stressful didn’t even begin to cover it. But the nurse was nice, if vigorous, and the result was negative. Phew. But we had been so isolated, it did feel unlikely that we would test positive. 2. At home, a lateral flow test, before going to see my husband’s daughter and family who had just returned from 4 years in the USA. They had done their quarantine, then the husband had tested positive, so they had another week or so of crawling up the walls, so they didn’t want to risk another positive test. It was a bit stressful because we really wanted to see them: we hadn’t seen them in eighteen months. If we’d have tested positive, we’d have self-isolated and delayed our visit. It would have been annoying but not awful. 3. I did a quick lateral flow when I felt unwell and worried. Again, nothing terrible would have happened if I tested positive, but I was glad I didn’t. . Who do you think benefitted from the tests that you took and in what way? I didn’t really think about this at the time, but I suppose the whole of society benefits from us knowing if we have Covid, as long as we act on the knowledge to make sure we don’t spread it any further. This reminds me that I notice we have all become much more careful about potentially spreading diseases. I was due to visit an old friend a few weeks ago, but she cancelled at the last minute. She had been staying with her children and grandchildren and they had all caught a vomiting bug. She was clear, and so the daughter said “Go home before you get it from us”. At home she still didn’t have the bug, but didn’t know if she would get it, or if she would not get it and pass it on to her visitors. So the weekend was cancelled, and we all understood the reasoning. And grateful not to spend two days throwing up in someone else’s house. But I’m not sure if we’d have thought like this pre-Covid. My friend did later get the vomiting bug and it was pretty nasty, so I’m very glad she spared me that experience. . Have you ever been hesitant to get tested (or to test a child/dependent)? Why was this? What did you decide to do in the end? I haven’t tested very often, but I guess that if hesitant, the best thing is probably to do the test. . Do you have lateral flow tests in the house? Have you (or other people) used them? What for? What was your experience of doing the test? M-O Number S7592 /Female /63 /Married /Shoreham by Sea/Retired We do keep lateral flow tests in the house, I’ve described using them above. The only people to use them have been me and my husband, but I know that when we have had visitors they have normally tested before they come to visit us, and this is increasingly becoming a part of visitors etiquette. Younger people especially have tested before they visit us. . Have you ever self-administered a diagnostic test for other health reasons such as diabetes? How did this compare to your experience of Covid-19 testing? No I don’t think I ever have. Views on testing . What is your view of the government Test and Trace programme (Test and Protect in Scotland) and how has your view changed over the course of the pandemic? Test and Trace has never worked as well as it might have done. At the beginning I thought that doctor’s surgeries should have been responsible for contacting people, though as the numbers are now so huge, I imagine they would have run out of resources and there would have been another crisis. I read Der Spiegel and I see the same concerns about the test and trace efforts there, the same lack of enthusiasm for the app. . Do you have any concerns about the accuracy of Covid-19 tests? Actually no, I don’t. We know they’re not 100% but the whole thing has been a huge undertaking. I’m just grateful we can test and hope we can eventually get out of this mess."

Where did you go for the vaccine? Who administered it? What was the atmosphere like? How did you travel to and from the vaccine centre? Which vaccine did you receive? (e.g Pfizer, Oxford or Moderna) How did you feel after the vaccine? Did you experience any side effects? Are you still following the government guidelines on reducing the spread of COVIDÂ­19 (e.g social distancing, wearing a mask, staying at home etc)? What are your thoughts on the latest guidelines and timescales on restrictions ? Are you concerned about the safety of the vaccine, if so, what worries you? The vaccine experience was great. Iâ€™d taken my husband to have his done the previous week so I knew something about it. The atmosphere was so positive, relief and smiles all round. Mine was Astra-Zeneca. I got it at whatâ€™s normally a conference centre/ live venue. I didnâ€™t look at the needle going in, as that always gives me a funny feeling, but I barely felt it and left the centre feeling very happy and positive. When I got home I was very very tired. I went to bed early, had a bad sleep with a bit of a temperature, I think. I took a couple of paracetamol, felt quite second rate the next day and then had a great sleep the following night and no further symptoms. Iâ€™m still following all the guidelines. Iâ€™m aware they may be unnecessary and in some cases anomalous, but this pandemic is uncharted water for all of us. My feeling is that if we all stick with the restrictions, then itâ€™s easier for the scientists to work out what to do next. Whereas, if we all interpret the rules according to our own needs, thereâ€™s no clear base to work from. I do feel optimistic. The main risk I see going forward is a new, stronger variant emerging from countries where the virus is running unchecked. But even if this happens, weâ€™re now in a position where we understand what to do, we know lockdown, we â€“ meaning the human race â€“ can cope with another similar pandemic. The safety of the vaccine isnâ€™t a worry for me. Itâ€™s far far better to have the vaccine than to have covid and of course even if I were to get ill from the vaccine, I wouldnâ€™t be transmitting my illness to others. The vaccine programme How is the vaccine programme being delivered in your local area? Please share any comments on the roll out of the vaccine programme.(e.g priority groups, planes to vaccinate key workers). M-O Number S7592 /Female /63 /Married /Shoreham by Sea/Retired Where do you get your information about the vaccine? Please share any thoughts on the publicity and media coverage, health advice, or misinformation about the vaccine. The local vaccine programme seems to be delivered in tons of different places. I went to an events centre. Larger surgeries are providing the vaccine and I believe even the racecourse is rolling it out. Although it would be great to have been able to give the vaccine to key workers first, I donâ€™t think this would have really worked. Doctors surgeries have pretty reliable information on peopleâ€™s age so can contact them by age group. Information about occupation isnâ€™t centrally held â€“ quite rightly â€“ and it would be difficult to sort the key workers at high risk in customer facing environments from those at lower risk. For example, my cousinâ€™s husband is a nurse, but for a long time worked purely in research establishments and had very little contact with sick people. I actually heard that my age group was due for the vaccine via two friends who sent me the link via WhatsApp. So this makes me worry that some groups â€“ for example, people who struggle with English â€“ may not be getting the information quickly enough. Making vaccines mandatory Cyprus says it will open its doors from May to UK tourists who have had both CovidÂ­19 jabs. It's prompted debate on whether 'vaccine passports' could become a feature of foreign travel, and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places like pubs or sports stadiums. Please share your thoughts on this topic. Are there any vaccinations that should, or shouldnâ€™t be, mandatory? I can see a vaccine passport being a part of foreign travel and I donâ€™t have an issue with this at all. Itâ€™s long been the case that travellers to certain countries need to be able to show that they have specific vaccines and this seems absolutely fine to me. When everyone in the country has had the opportunity to have a covid vaccine, then I feel that itâ€™s legitimate for schools and workplaces to refuse people who have not been vaccinated. And if they can do this, then why not big sporting events? However, itâ€™s unfair to make pubs and smaller venues responsible for implementing this level of security. Many of them, who have been closed for so long and lost so much money, wouldnâ€™t be able to face turning business away."

Portugal was locking down already and there was a sense that the UK ought to do so. My memory of those first few weeks is of a time of pure fear. Travelling home on the plane, using home-made hand sanitiser (alcohol + hand cream), wearing plastic decorating gloves that split as soon as I touched anything, I started to doubt our common sense in even trying to return home.   The first weeks were something of a blur. I’ve lived in some extremely uneventful places, so I was mentally prepared for the quiet times, and as I’ve worked  primarily from home since 2004, I was in a good place to find my own things to do. I’d even ordered a couple of crochet kits online so I had new things to do. I set up a daily schedule, which was easy to stick to as there wasn’t anything to disrupt it.   Here’s a sample week:    Thursday 14 May  Friday 15 May  Saturday 16 May              before breakfast   food shopping  walk  run 40 minutes        upper arms, firm butt     after breakfast       practical  run 30 minutes interval  10:00 pick up fish  10:30 Tennis call     bathroom  kitchen  balcony/terrace  after coffee      portuguese lesson  portuguese lesson  portuguese lesson     portuguese media  portuguese homework  portuguese homework  after lunch  creative  calligraphy  calligraphy  calligraphy  later  mass observation stuff  baking  post and filing  after treat   diary theme  diary  diary     mindfulness  mindfulness  mindfulness     7 days 7 photos  7 days 7 photos  7 days 7 photos            This all looks great, but that wasn’t entirely the case. I woke up at 3am – scared we would all die, seeing piles of corpses in the streets -  so frequently that I ended up following an NHS course to help. Insomnia always leaves me jittery and depressed and that in its turn of course is what wakes me up at 3am. So I was in a vicious circle. I used to say “This would all be alright, if it weren’t for the fear’.   We were scared to go out, scared to touch the door of our common entrance, scared that others in the apartment block would get Covid and pass it on to us. We washed and sprayed everything that came into the house.   After a while I would go for a walk, later building up to running, three times a week early in the morning and those empty times with the streets clear of traffic and only the runners and swimmers (I live by the sea) on the streets, were wonderful.  My husband went for walks separately to me. I needed some time alone and taking our exercise separately gave each of us a break from the other.   There were some regular calls that I really did look forward to, even putting on makeup for them. There was a group of women who I play tennis with on a Saturday morning and we had a call at the same time we would have played tennis. There’s also a group of friends from school, and I stayed in touch with them on WhatsApp, often exchanging messages and photos throughout the day.   Like everyone, we thought the birds were louder this year; we appreciated the time without traffic and aeroplanes though I’d never consciously noticed them before. I was grateful to every delivery driver that came.   I’ve never stayed home for such a long time before and we had to learn to use the full extent of our flat. A freezer went into the spare room. We sat on the back terrace, which we’d rarely done before. I took my morning coffee out onto the balcony. I could see young families cooped up in flats the same size and smaller than ours; I heard the neighbours behind us on endless zoom calls. I saw how lockdown gradually began to break.    Homelife  I talked about this mostly in the previous section. We did add a couple of new things to our routine: a morning coffee, for example. Little treats that marked the day into sections.   I’m more of a morning person and so I used the time before my husband gets up to go for a run or to do my own things.   We both have computers and we both would have our computers out most of the day.   We’ve continued in many ways pretty much as we were, though as my husband is 76, I was the one to go out more, to do the shopping and to take any risks.   I can’t see us going to the theatre & things like that for a long time. We have been out to eat since the rules relaxed, but always outside and only in places we felt comfortable in.   I can’t imagine when we will go to London again, which I used to do probably a couple of times a week, and I can’t see how I will be able to see my spread-out network of friends in the next year or so. This left me feeling frankly pretty lonely: I have few friends where I live & have relied really on meeting friends in London or visiting them where they live.   So now we are hoping to move to a new house. Where we live now is a flat in a converted Regency house. The area is much much younger than we are: young couples and people starting out. We should have moved some years ago, but my mum had dementia and was in a home and my husband’s mum was dying too, and we didn’t have the energy to move house.   Now, we hope to move a few miles west, into a new build estate, where we hope we’ll be able to make new friends and have some sense of community.     Media and technology  I’ve used zoom/facetime/WhatsApp to be in touch with friends and family. The daily WhatsApp conversations with my schoolfriends petered out as soon as the restrictions lifted enough for them to see their children and grandchildren. I had expected this, and it wasn’t a surprise (though I’d enjoyed the daily contact!). My husband’s daughter and family are in the USA and we continue to use Facetime to speak to them. No plans to visit, of course.   I started to do our weekly shop online and this has been a massive time saver and I will definitely keep that going. I also speak to my cousin and her mother once a week on facetime and I’ve been really happy to have that contact.   After a few weeks of lockdown, I took the calendar down from the wall and threw it away. There didn’t seem to be any point marking the days and weeks.   I bought quite a lot of clothes and stuff online, particularly at the beginning when I thought we were all going to die. There’s a pink leather jacket I don’t regret, a green silk dress that I do slightly regret and a couple of things that were frankly mistakes. But the shopping got us through.    Waiting  I haven’t perceived this time as waiting. I’ve perceived it as a time of change. In some ways I have enjoyed the sense that we are all experiencing this awful thing together.   Will I see friends and family again? I don’t know.  Will we go to Madrid for a weekend just because again? Probably not.   I miss the friends I can’t see and the family I can’t visit, but it doesn’t feel like waiting. It feels like things have changed."

I have not had the need to undergo a test for medical reasons, because I have not had any suspicious symptoms nor been in contact with a known case. Mychildren have done lateral flow tests before we met to avoid bringing the virus to me. However, on two occasions I have visited Jersey with my daughter to see my family who live there. The island has a system of testing visitors on arrival at the port. Thus I have had two PCR tests, administered by efficient operators in the customs shed at Jersey harbour. While I remained in the car, the test was conducted through the car window by two operators dressed in PPE. They took samples from my throat and nostrils and noted my name and a contact number. The confirmation of a negative result arrived within a few hours. It was a slightly uncomfortable moment but very brief. The whole process took about two minutes and then we were allowed to drive off. I have equipped myself with some lateral flow tests kits but have not used them. They were available at the chemist who gave me my booster jab. I know I will find it difficult to take a swab from my throat, so hope I do not have to do one. I live on my own so there is no-one to help. My son tells me that a new version is being produced which requires only the nose sample, this would be much easier. I have some misgivings about the lateral flow test as it is reputed to give false readings and could therefore be allowing infectious people to be at large. My knowledge of the test and trace programme app is only anecdotal and I know that it became a mockery in July as so many people were being pinged. Apparently in some cases they had been near someone but in a different room, the wall being undetected by the technology. This led to people switching the app off. I did not engage with this as I do not carry a phone and rarely go out. Now that we are being encouraged to resume our normal activities I foresee more cases but hope that the vaccine will reduce the severity of the illness."

There had been some appointments at hospitals in other towns but as I do not drive I waited until the local invitations were issued. It was a vile day with intermittent snow and sleet. I was grateful for the offer of a lift from a friend as I did not want to have to walk or take a bus and at that stage we were unsure about whether there would be any immediate after effects. When we arrived there were crowds of people, all elderly like myself, milling around but trying to keep socially distanced. We formed a ragged queue outside the doors, huddling under the ambulance canopy. We were told that there was a delay because the computer systems had failed. Faced with the prospect of staying or coming back later, I decided to stay and hope for the best. People who arrived for later appointments waited more than an hour outside with very long queues. I was lucky, we were ushered inside in turn after about fifteen minutes. The staff were obviously as cold as we were. At the door we were checked in, temperature checked, and asked to sanitise our hands, then took a seat on a succession of chairs arranged around a large empty area (normally the waiting room), moving along as each person was ushered into the vaccination station in turn. It was like a strange version of musical chairs with everyone in thick clothes and scarves, difficult to tell staff from patients, although they did have lanyards. Everyone was quite cheerful and the process efficient now that everything was working. I was pleased to note that those with mobility problems did not join the chair exercise but jumped the queue and went straight in. The vaccinations were delivered in another large room around which there were about ten individual points of delivery where one person sat at a computer taking details at a suitable distance from the chair provided for the patient. A nurse gave the vaccination. Various screens provided scanty separation, they were mainly deployed to shield the operational area from the rest of the room where we had to sit to recover for fifteen minutes. Then we were allowed to leave by a different exit at the side of the building. All this was efficiently and cheerfully choreographed by several volunteers who were kept busy wiping chairs with sanitizer each time someone left. We were given a couple of leaflets to keep. It was quite speedy. I had the Pfizer vaccine and apart from a tender arm suffered no side effects. By the time I had my second dose the operation was very slick. Again my kind friend gave me a lift to the hospital. Having given my details to a person stationed outside the vaccination room, temperature checked and hands sprayed,  I went straight to a chair to be vaccinated. Then into a different room lined with chairs, spaced out,  for recovery, again monitored by a volunteer with sanitizer wiping chairs,  before I left by a different door. I had a slightly tender arm but otherwise felt no side effects. I was delighted to feel that I had some degree of immunity and secretly tickled that for once it had been a bonus to be of advanced years so that I was one of the first in the queue! Despite feeling less vulnerable I have not changed my routine at all yet. I have my Tesco delivery and have yet to venture into a shop. I had coffee in the garden with a friend on one occasion but the weather has not been inviting of late. I went on the bus to have a blood test, the journey was only two minutes (uphill)  and the bus had only about six passengers so I felt fairly safe. I do not feel ready to go into the town or to socialise despite the fact that from today we are allowed to meet indoors. My family do not live nearby and I may see friends, preferably in the garden, as we are all still taking note of the warnings about prolonged contact, particularly indoors. I plan to visit my daughter at half term in two weeks time when she will drive to collect me,  and we plan to go by train to Penzance from Bristol, then to the Scilly Isles for a delayed self catering holiday, postponed from last summer. This will be a major test of our courage! I have no reservations about the vaccine, it is wonderful to be able to benefit from such medical advances. While I have no intention of taking foreign holidays yet,  or even visit a pub or sports stadium, it seems absolutely sensible to have vaccine passports and to regulate access accordingly. I see no infringement of human rights in such a procedure provided there are safeguards in place to protect those with medical exemption."

My husband died in 2011, after two years of dementia when I was almost more lonely but very stressed. Lock down is relaxing compared to that time. I think I was conditioned to solitude when, from the age of 12 to18, I lived in digs, away from my family who had returned to Jersey in 1945 while I stayed on at school to take exams. Of course I went home for holidays, when as the eldest of five children I was plunged into the hurly burly of family life, but had to organise myself and my time during the term, becoming self reliant and disciplined at an early age. Although I miss the meetings I normally attend, and seeing friends, I have not found that being at home has been particularly hard. I am normally selectively sociable not gregarious for the sake of seeing other people. I have a freezer full of food, and well stocked store cupboard. A friend gets fresh fruit and veg for me each week. She has my credit card for contactless payment, saving us any actual cash transactions. Milk is delivered with my newspaper, both a novel addition to my life since lock down. My attitude to the virus is one of ostrich like optimism. I find safety in my own surroundings and try not to dwell on the possibility of catching it. At my age it might well be fatal. I do wake at night sometimes and find myself thinking about the depressing mortality figures and fretting about the health of those I love. I scan the daily newspaper but try not to read all the conjecture and reports. In fact I have changed from the Telegraph to the I where I get quite enough coronavirus detail and a more balanced coverage of general news. In the evening I initially watched the five pm briefings avidly, but soon tired of hearing depressing figures. I now watch the six pm news on TV which summarises the main points. It is clear that the report on how we should improve our preparations for a pandemic, published in 2016, highlighting the need for more protective clothing, was not heeded. Hindsight tells us that we were not prepared for the extent of the demand for PPE or that the global competition for this, and for the chemicals needed for testing, were to cause shortages. The countries that have coped well were better prepared and had firm plans for isolation and testing. They had experience from previous epidemics and knew how to react. They are also more authoritarian and willing to limit personal freedoms by quarantine and isolation. I have been impressed by Boris Johnson’s firm leadership to date and his strong messages expressed so vividly in colourful imagery. I say this as someone who is not a supporter of him or his party. Matt Hancock, the Health Minister, also seems to have been doing a sterling job. The economic measures have been timely and necessary but will create a huge government debt which we will all have to contribute towards to pay off. The DWP have apparently managed to process payments to thousands of new claimants in record time. Some of the difficulties in the care homes seem to be rooted in the failings of the overall health system which have long been in need of a drastic overhaul to bring the provision in the community and the NHS together. The overlap between the local authority responsibility for care in the community and hospital care is cumbersome and inefficient. The financial complications are equally convoluted as I discovered when my husband was ill. I hope that one positive outcome of this crisis will be to streamline all aspects, with cross party cooperation. Successive governments have recognised that there is a problem but failed to act. They have been avoiding the extra costs of proper care provision and the admission that people may have to pay more to cover the costs, either individually or through taxation. As for the coming months, I suspect that the social distancing rules, particularly outdoors, may be reduced and masks may become mandatory in shops and on transport. I have a smart cloth mask made by my sister in law in Jersey. The government is damned what ever they do, with critics quick to attack any decision taken especially as infection rates may rise as lock down eases. In the face of the crisis I wish there were fewer voices ready to condemn every move. Businesses want to get back to trading but workers may be reluctant to travel to offices and workplaces. Those who have been furloughed have had unexpected paid leisure time and may be reluctant to lose this, albeit with 20% more money to spend. Parents fear for their children if the schools reopen. As a former school governor, I can imagine how complicated it will be to stagger the return to the classroom and overcome the problems of safe guarding the health of pupils and staff. Some over 70s seem eager to resume their former activities according to the papers, but most of my acquaintance are wary of exposing themselves to infection. Both my children are working from home which seems to be efficient and, with spare bedrooms, not inconvenient. It must be difficult for people in more cramped conditions with young children. The benefits to the environment of fewer journeys by commuters and to the individuals who save on time and travel expenses may encourage a continuation of this form of working, for at least some of the time. Increased testing for infection combined with the smart phone app being trialled on the Isle of Wight may offer some help with tracing contacts, particularly in the working population who tend to have smart phones. However, it may not be much use in care homes or schools where these devices are less common, or indeed among the more elderly population. Maybe we will have to wait until a vaccine is developed, it would certainly be a reassurance. My home life has adapted to the changes made by lock down. I cannot have my cleaner in the house so have bought a robot vacuum cleaner to do the floors. Other aspects of hygiene and dusting I can cope with. My weekly garden helper initially did not come and I had to mow my large lawn. However, he now uses his two hours of exercise to do outside tasks for neighbours and has been to mow. The most difficult aspect has been the care of my toe nails. My sight is not good enough to risk using scissors and my filing is not very efficient. I will be glad when the chiropodist returns. I am thinking that maybe he could do my feet in the garden where the virus transmission is likely to be greatly reduced. I have delayed my annual visits to dentist and optician until it is considered safe. I normally use a bus to go to the town, and take a taxi for other trips, or have lifts from friends. I am seriously thinking of getting an electric tricycle to avoid the bus and to give me more flexibility. I have been unsuccessful in getting through on the special delivery phone line to Sainsburys. I have given up trying as currently have no need. A neighbour has a regular delivery as she is vulnerable and on the official list and has offered to add anything I need to her order. Flour was in short supply but I did get a packet. I was concerned about making a cash transfer and obtaining cash without going to the bank. Nat West set up a special over 70s helpline which efficiently dealt with both these problems. I have registered with the Essex welfare services and receive regular check up phone calls from them and from the local council to make sure I have all the help I need. They offer volunteers for shopping if needed. I mainly use email and the telephone to communicate with family and friends. This has been supplemented by an occasional Zoom meeting. I like to see my grandchildren occasionally but on the whole find chatting on the phone more natural. I think we chat more often and for longer at present than before the pandemic struck. I have learned how to use Zoom and convene meetings of my U3A groups on it. We chat in French and compare our research into Family History. In general I think it is rather more stilted than face to face, but better than nothing. I have contacted some friends to whom I rarely speak, knowing they will have time to spare. I chat each weekend to my son who lives in Suffolk. We play Word each day, and thus he knows I am still OK. He lives by the sea and has been sending me photos from their daily walks as a substitute for visits. My daughter phones every few days and we also send brief messages. I exchange daily emails with my sister who lives in Jersey, as we have done for many years. In the glorious weather of this exceptional spring I have enjoyed sitting outside basking in the warmth and admiring my garden as it has transformed from winter into spring. I have appreciated it more fully this year. The skies have been bluer and quieter. Blossom has been sweetly scented and birds sung in the trees. I count myself lucky to have such an attractive place to endure lock down. I am not without imagination and occasionally harbour dark thoughts of death, but at my age I know it can come at any time and that I should just enjoy the present. I adore my thirteen year old grand daughter who lives in Bristol and would love to see her grow up. I try to suppress the dark thoughts and concentrate on the joys of life. Unlike many of my friends I have not been driven to clear out cupboards and loft, although they could benefit from it! The lock down has instead induced a feeling of lassitude. I get up later than before and go to bed later. My eating habits are unchanged as is my diet. I am a sluggish exerciser. I do a few stretches each morning and some exercises for my arthritic knee. I make myself go upstairs several times a day. I have been out only a couple of times for a walk. Living on a hill means I puff whichever way I choose. I live on the edge of town with easy access to country footpaths but am wary of tackling these routes on my own for fear of stumbling. They were always better with company when I was fitter. My walking is slow and I am lazy. I regard my pottering in the garden as my main exercise. My pattern of life, cleaning, washing, showering and shampooing remain pretty much as before. I am eating similar foods and have the occasional glass of wine, I do a little baking from time to time, as before. I am not a keen housewife. I enjoy my garden more than being indoors. I stopped my habitual listening to Radio 4 when they talked interminably about Brexit and have not returned to my former regular listening. I do listen to some discussion programmes, The Bottom Line and the Briefing Room. I enjoy the Sunday Night is Music Night concerts and have tuned into Angel Radio for some nostalgic music. I am not a regular listener to music. In general I prefer to listen to the birds during the daytime. I do not have earphones or use my I pad for listening, but use a digital radio. I play games on my I pad, Sudoku, Word and Solitaire, possibly more than before. I also have the extra puzzle pages in the newspaper which are entertaining and addictive: I spend many hours in harmless puzzling. I know I could be more usefully employed turning out cupboards and feel slightly guilty! The advantage of living alone is that no one else knows or cares. My children are happy if I am happy and well. Their benign tolerance of my independent life is a great solace, they do not interfere, but are gently solicitous and loving. What more could one want? I watch TV in the evening, Antiques Road show, Gardening programmes, some documentaries and quizzes like Mastermind and Only Connect. I like detective drama and novels. I watch Vera and Morse, and have been reading The Lewis chess men trilogy by Peter May. Often in the evening I have a long chat with my daughter. She has an interesting job and is involved with her local community. I enjoy hearing about her activities, vicariously sharing some of the excitement. I don’t think I ever had her amount of energy! Otherwise, I write up my daily log, send emails, and do about an hour in the garden. I chat to friends, usually one phone call a day. I occasionally consider my family history, planning how to present photos and integrate them with written accounts. I find dealing with digital photos confusing and frustrating and have to brace myself to battle with the complexity of the programmes. I enjoy reading and occasionally binge read a whole book in a day. Similarly I watch several episodes of films/ programmes: recently enjoyed The Queen, Pride and Prejudice and Belgravia for escapism. Box sets are very addictive and I find myself watching late into the night. I have watched the Royal Opera House production of Cosi Fan Tutti and some orchestral concerts, some with players assembled on Zoom. I watched some art tours of galleries and a quiz about the works. I enjoy some of the travel programmes, usually those with a historical slant, a substitute for the holidays we cannot take at present. This weekend I enjoyed the film The Darkest Hour with the Oscar winning performance by Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, I had seen it in the cinema but it was worth watching again, as a reminder of why we should cherish our freedom and how close we came to losing it9n 1940. This week I should have been in Jersey celebrating 75 years since the Liberation, but this was cancelled, maybe to be revived next year as 75 plus 1. I have put a Union Jack and a Jersey flag in my window for the VE /Liberation days this weekend. I remember vividly the excitement as the war in Europe ended, and our eagerness for news of our family who had been under German occupation for five years. Later this summer a trip to the Scilly Isles with my daughter and family has also been cancelled. We hope to go next year. I believe that it may be several years before international travel for holidays becomes affordable and safe. I must admit that it is hard to see how this virus can be beaten until a vaccine is available for general use and I feel my life is on hold until that time. I just hope that we have a sunny summer to help to make the wait more tolerable."

Retired from job as Manager of the local Citizens Advicebureau.Covid -19 and TimeLooking back over the past five months my principal feeling is that the pace ofmy life has slowed down and that days and weeks have merged into a formlesscontinuum.I would have thought my life was very slow before the pandemic hit us, butwithout any activities outside my home and with all shopping done by others, Ihave just drifted through each day. Reading and doing puzzles are my mainoccupations, with occasional bursts of energy taking me out into my garden totweak   a few weeds or cut back plants.I have taken a few walks outside the house and garden but generally believethat I can get enough exercise by my household and gardening activities.My gardenThe fine weather made it pleasant to stay at home soaking up the warmthunder the shade of my parasol in a sheltered corner of my garden. My plantsand the changing seasons have provided me with constant pleasure. Thespring and summer have been splendid this year, made even more enjoyableby the peace of no traffic or airplane noise. The sky was never clearer.Birdsong was audible and seemed more plentiful.One innovation I made this year because of Covid 19 was to grow somevegetables in pots. I normally go on holiday at harvest time so it is not worthwhile cultivating vegetables, but knowing I would be at home encouraged meto plant beans and tomatoes which I am now enjoying. I also grew more plantsand seeds than usual for the flower garden.I have noticed that the fruit is ripening early this year, my fig tree has ripe fruita good two weeks ahead of normal years. I cannot attribute this to Covid19,but to the warm weather.I have never been more grateful to have a garden to enjoy, the changingseasons provide constant interest as I love watching my plants develop andenjoy the tranquil environment.Domestic routineI normally go to a few meetings and out to get my shopping each week. I nolonger drive, so have to plan any excursions. This activity disappeared. MySxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B7306.pdftime has been clear of any outside intrusion and I have really enjoyed the lackof pressure to do anything.One of the effects of lock down has been that I have not adjusted my bodyclock to summer time. Normally I make an effort to have my daily routine in apattern, getting up at 8 and going to bed at 11 but this has changed to 9 andmidnight! I shall be ready to out the clocks back in October! Time is notimportant with no set activities.Mealtimes have slipped to match with no external considerations toaccommodate. I watch very little TV but have to make sure I am aware of thetime    in order to watch the news each evening or if a favourite programme isshowing. Otherwise the passage of time flows by without my noticing it.The main changes in my domestic routine were quickly surmounted at the startof lock down. Milk and newspaper delivered, a slot in Tesco delivery bookedabout once a month, initially with difficulty, but now much easier. A kindneighbour gets any fresh fruit and veg that I need when she does her weeklyshop.My store cupboard and freezer are filled to capacity. I have always been asquirrel and lock down has encouraged this trait.My medication continues to be delivered by the pharmacy, having beenrequested online.The people who formerly came into the house can do so no longer. Therefore,having lost my human cleaner, I bought a robot vacuum cleaner which doesthe back breaking task of cleaning floors while I do the rest.During lock down I really missed my chiropodist as my toenails grew very longand I cannot cut them myself. I was relieved when he was allowed to resumevisiting. On his first visit we sat socially distanced in the garden, he wears amask and has made a second visit indoors.Outside maintenance has been unproblematic. I have had planned exteriorpainting done and my handyman/gardener comes each week to mow and trimas needed. I have a big garden with lots of hedges so am relieved that he isable to visit.Contact with family and friendsSince lock down has eased I have invited friends to come for tea outside in thegarden, just a single person at a time. We sit at a distance from one anotherbut it feels quite normal.One element of how I regard time is the punctuation of the year by familyvisits and holidays. We are scattered over southern England and Jersey andthese reunions are the highlight of my life. Covid19 has brought all these to anSxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B7306.pdfabrupt halt. At Christmas we planned and booked trips and holidays together,but these regretfully have been cancelled.Just as with the weekly pattern of home life, the removal of the highlightsaway from home has meant that I have lacked the familiar markers in thepassage of time through the year so that the months have merged and dateshave become meaningless. The seasons have more significance than dates ona calendar.At the beginning of lock down the prospect of twelve weeks in social isolationseemed like an endlessly long period to be endured, but to my surprise it haspassed remarkably quickly.My life does still seem to be on hold, suspended until the vaccine is perfectedas I shall continue to observe social distancing as much as possible.Because I am dependent on public transport and would normally travel by busand train to visit, I am pessimistic about my chances of going to see my family.As I am apprehensive about the dangers of infection while travelling, I willhave to wait until they can drive to see me and even then we will observesocial distancing unless they have had a Covid test before coming.Living at a distance from all my family I have found myself envying those whohave some living nearby and can see them, albeit at a distance.During the past five months we have kept in touch by phone and email and theoccasional group chat by Zoom. I actually prefer the intimacy of the telephoneand enjoy a weekly chat with my son and daughter. I do not need to see thecaller and find the sight of myself on a screen as we talk a distraction.I have a daily email exchange with my sister.I play daily word games with my son to reassure him that I am still alive, ahabit we developed before Covid 19 struck, because I live alone.At the beginning of lock down there was a flurry of communication with friendsand family but this has settled back into its normal pattern.Inertia or activity?My internet activity has increased in lock down. My U3A interest groups havemoved to Zoom meetings so that each month I join in French conversation,Family History, and Art appreciation discussions. Singing for fun has so fareluded us.I have spent more time on my I pad playing word games and doing puzzles.SxMOA2_1_119_1_2_B7306.pdfSome people have been clearing out cupboards and decorating during lockdown. I have not been inspired to do any of these tasks although there areplenty waiting for attention.The whole situation has left me feeling frozen in time, so that I cannot plan todo                                         anything and am not motivated to be busy and energetic. Maybe the sunhas something to do with this as I do love to sit and bask in the warmth.I somehow doubt that this will change much as the weather cools!I feel the suspension of normal life is robbing my declining years ofopportunity.                                             I had expected to put my house on the market and to move to livenearer to my daughter but the property market in this area is stagnant. While Iam effectively confined to my house I am glad that I have not left my garden.However, the situation has introduced a feeling of tension as I contemplate thefuture and the possibility that I might be stuck here for another year.I have items I want to dispose of but am disinclined to initiate buyers cominginto the house. The reduction of activity in Stansted, a major local employer,will depress the local economy for some time.However, with a large house in a rural environment, the brighter side to theCovid effect is that a house suitable for home working within commutingdistance of London may have a new appeal for buyers wanting to move out ofLondon.In general I am marking time. My pleasures are simple and low key but losingthe opportunity to visit my family and go on holidays and outings makes mefeel that part of my life has been stolen."

I have been a single mother since 1999, now divorced. I have 2 children. My son lives in a shared house in London where he works for a Think Tank company. My daughter moved back home after graduating in June 2019. She has been a freelancing prop maker and scenic fabricator. She is not eligible for the self-employed government support now she is unemployed. I have been in education all my working life. I was a primary teacher until I had my family and then worked as a TA after becoming a single parent. I now work full time supplying books to primary schools. I live in Littlehampton and have lived in Sussex since coming to University in xxxxx. May 12 2020 Woke at 6am, exhausted, as I hadn’t been able to sleep very well, too many thoughts in my head. I remember the living room clock chimed the half hour at 2.30am. I must have finally fallen asleep then. Heard the interview on BBC Sussex about the Mass Observation today so decided to note down what I do throughout the day. I felt so tired I didn’t do the 30 minute cardio this morning. I’ll go out on my bike later, for my government approved daily outdoor exercise, that is if the wind dies down. It’s been so strong these last few days that I’ll be pedalling and going nowhere if I try the seafront heading east. Got up before 8am because it’s bin day and I don’t put them out the night before because of foxes and seagulls attacking them. Two of my neighbours opposite were talking to each other, about 2 metres apart, I looked across to wave or greet them, but they remained in conversation. The radio traffic news was reporting some tailbacks in the usual places! That’s the first for weeks. Hardly surprising following the Government’s suggestion that people return to work, even though over 3000 people tested positive for the virus yesterday and hundreds are still dying each day. This disease is nowhere near under control, we should have held tight another few weeks perhaps, like Scotland, Wales and NI are doing. Economic recovery would be quicker if the workforce is not fluctuating with quarantining or illness. What a shame the Government hasn’t taken this pause in life to implement positive environmentally impactful changes in our culture. Any unforeseen benefit to the planet from this dreadful pandemic will be lost in the rush to ‘get back to normal’. Cleaner water, unpolluted air and returning wildlife to some places will be lost with no effort to preserve it. I despair when I hear on the radio that Ryan Air expect to be back to 40% flights by July. International travel is a key factor in the rapid spread of coronavirus, which resulted in governments being ill-prepared to tackle it. Not to mention the pollution. We need to re-think our whole way of life on this planet, and find alternative ways to live and work that are more sustainable. We need to find other ways to work that can still be fulfilling careers. All the hoo-ha in the media from politicians, celebrities and citizens claiming the positives to this enforced lockdown in the pace of life, time well-spent with families, quiet, bird-song etc is being instantly forgotten in our misguided self-interest. It’s depressing. My daughter has emerged for breakfast. I need to get some work done before the conference call at 11am. Hoping we’ll be told we can go back to work. We have suggested shift patterns and ways to socially distance in the office, we are doing all we can from home, but somethings require us to be in the office. I’ve never used my laptop so much. I have to charge up during the day. I have an email from my colleague. She hasn’t been able to get one of the links to work in my poetry Tweet for today. A Tweet about limericks without a link to Edward Lear, c’est la vie! I have an email from the school I applied to acknowledging receipt of my job application. 10.45am Searching the internet for books with colours in the title. I thought a booklist for schools inspired by the current rainbow theme would be fun. I’m sure we have a picture book about an owl 12 May 2020 and an orange scarf, can’t remember the title. G has gone upstairs to work in her brother’s room. The light is much better in his room with it facing south. She needs good light for the intricate engraving she’s doing. My hands are actually freezing while I type, it’s so cold in the house today. 1pm Just finished the conference call then had my colleague texting me. She is as frustrated and upset as I am. How often do we have to keep explaining our jobs to our manager?  We even had to explain why it was impossible to socially distance on the mobile library van!! He doesn’t understand the process of what we do. We have so much work to catch up with. He’s told us we each have to do 2 shifts a week for the foreseeable, for the Council’s contacting vulnerable residents call service (at the public library nearest to us) where tape has been put down to create 2m distances and sprays and wipes provided to clean laptops, yet we can’t go into our basement office to unpack and shelve boxes of books that have sat untouched for 7 weeks? Nor will he say when our office will be risk assessed and sorted for us to return to because the government didn’t mention that public libraries could open. Yet the Council have opened public libraries to use them as call centres? How many times do we have to tell him we have customers who pay us directly for a book delivery service and the schools have never closed?! My colleague and I exchanged several text messages of frustration. G and I had lunch. We both forgot to get more bread out of the freezer so she finished the loaf and I had Ryvita with my cheese. 2pm G went back up to work. I reminded her to send a link to my friend M so they can showcase their different skills on each other’s online platforms. G is hoping she might hear about some work if theatres open again for the autumn I worked on some documents for my professional registration whilst listening to a webinar about school libraries returning after lockdown. Had a text from L asking how we are, had a little vent about the conference call. She wasn’t surprised. 4.20pm The wind seems to have dropped, so I dragged the bikes out of the shed, pumped up all the tyres and G and I headed out for a cycle. It was noticeably busier with cars on the roads. G struggled a little even though she had taken her inhaler before leaving the house. She says she never used it whilst at Uni so I am concerned how often she needs it now she is back home. 5 pm G helped me measure out the hole we created in the garden for the raised bed. We also measured the path through the wooded area so I can order one load of stones for both jobs. Just need to search the internet to find a local supplier who will do home deliveries. Evening G and I discussed our evening meal. We need to eat up the leftover mince from 2 days ago, so we decided to roast some sweet potato cubes and the carrot that was peeled but not used 2 days ago, with the last of the frozen roast potatoes. As we are putting on the oven we’ll have the fruit strudel with the last of the Ben & Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie ice cream. Dinner on trays while G and I watch the tv. It was very tasty. I texted my niece to see how she and the girls are doing. They were into school last week (my niece is a keyworker) and did some work about VE day. I suggested they talk to Mum as she was 12 at the end of the war and would remember VE day. Before it got too dark I popped out to do some watering as it hasn’t rained after all. The peas and carrots are looking quite dry. Find some snails in the hosta pots so I make up some garlic spray. I also spray lavender around as there were several cats in the garden today. Lavender seems to put some 12 May 2020 of them off pooing in my borders. I’ll water again tomorrow morning as I don’t want to attract the slugs to my veg overnight. Not much on the tv, we started watching a film because I recognized the title and wondered if it was a book. G knew it, and said it she didn’t think the films (it’s a series of books) had received good reviews because fans of the books didn’t think the adaptations were as good as the books. I lost interest after about half an hour and read through my library quarterly magazine. I marked a few things in articles to check out tomorrow on the internet. G made drinks before bed tonight. I didn’t want hot chocolate, it’s quite sweet so she just added more hot water to my fruit infusion from earlier today. After the last episode of the BBC show ‘I’ll Get This’ quite entertaining tonight, but then I like Sue Perkins and Jonny Vegas, I headed to bed. “I donate my 12th May diary to the Mass Observation Archive.

Gardening.MASS OBSERVATION – AUTUMN DIRECTIVE 2020Part 2 - Everyday Health and WellbeingI am in my late 70's and good health means now, after some health issues over the years, feeling well and wanting to keep well for as long as possible.	A healthy body means endeavouring, at my age, to keep fit with a healthy varied diet, with three meals a day, exercise like daily walks, weekly visits to the gym and swimming pool (this year of course these activities have not been open much of the time).My first experiences of health and wellbeing would have been over 70 years ago through my Mother cooking nourishing meals- not always easy just after WW2 with food shortages and rationing. Exercise was important then but as we didn't have a car in the family 70 years ago we all walked more, to school, shopping, We did cycle a lot but that is a good form of exercise; these last few years have seen cycling very popular again with many cycle lanes in our towns, and all roads where possible. We are often told today that our health problems, obesity , is due to lack of exercise and not eating the 'right' food, although I do realise finance comes into what food can be bought in some families, the most nutricous food may be more expensive, also could take longer to prepare and cook and in todays rather hectic lifestyle time can be important.I didn't really think much about health and wellbeing as a child, just accepting the food my Mother cooked, some of which would be called stodgy now! And plenty of walking/cycling exercise as mentioned. I am relatively fortunate as I do not 'put on' too much weight whatever I eat. I don't recall any advice about health at school - but that was in the late 1940's/1950's. We were too busy recovering from the war. We wouldn't have put weight on with sweets as they were still rationed.Key momentsMy Mother told me about having periods. I think she found it an embarrassing subject nearly 70 years ago. She gave me a book to read about adolescent subjects, and when my periods began at age 12 she just handed me products to use. I don't recall discussing bodily changes with my friends, but as mentioned things were not as 'openly discussed' as now. I just coped and accepted all the changes. I do remember having my first bra, but my Mother bought it.Of course as a teenager I did begin to think more about my appearance, what clothes I wore, make­ up, Most of my clothes as a small child were made by my Mother and Aunts, with occasional special outfits made by a dressmaker. I can still remember standing on a chair as our dressmaker - luckily a family friend who didn't charge too much, pinned dresses and skirts, and she also made my first petticoats. Everyone knitted, and I had many aunts who were not married and they knitted for my sister and myself. When I began work at age 15 and had a small wage I began to buy ready made clothes- one beautiful skirt by well known Gor-ray cost under £2. I have a photo of myself wearing it. I also went to the hairdresser more often once I began earning, a lovely experience then in your own individual cubicle. I also purchased face powder, lipstick, rouge and some eye shadow mostly from Boots where I stiJ) shop today..-2-Mass Observation -Autumn Directive (Cont'd) Part 2 : Everyday Health and WellbeingI don't think my parents, back in the 1940's/l 950's were too concerned with Fashion. My Father as a company secretary - white collar worker, had to wear a smart suit during the week and even at the weekends wouldn't have been seen with out a tie. I have old black and white photographs of my sister and I members of my family sitting on the beach in Cliftonville, my Grandmother has a smart hat and dress on, my Grandfather a suit and hat my Father does look to have an open top shirt and shorts, my sister and I have pretty dresses on, but we all look very happy! I do think back then we did all dress 'individuality' as many outfits were hand made, half the population looks the same thesedays. My parents did go to dinner/dances organised by my Father's company and again I have black & white photographs - my Father in a evening suit and my Mother in lovely, sometimes long, ballroom dresses. Even when I started work, at age 15, in an office, I was not allowed to wear trousers, but a smart blouse, jersey and skirt, no jeans and sloppy jumper. I still like to change when going out in the afternoon/evening - now retired I may have been doing housework, preparing a meal in the morning with an apron on.I do try and keep up-to-date with ways to keep a healthy lifestyle, medical advances, smart if not in high fashion, but mainly, in my late 70's, I hope my health will remain stable for a while yet. At the moment I'm waiting for the vaccine and sincerely hope next year life will begin to return to some sort of normality.."

It has been frustrating at times but there has been no choice. I was locked down from March 14th in Murcia Spain and it was difficult to return to the UK with our car and our dog as ferries weren’t running. Here’s a diary of this time 13.3.20 I am spending three months in the Murcia region of Spain with my husband. We have been watching the news about the threat of Covid-19 in U.K. and Spain but there has not been a sense of emergency about the spread to either country although we are distressed to see how Italy is badly hit by the virus. My cousin is arriving on a flight from the Newcastle UK to stay with us for a week and my sister and her husband are arriving on a flight from London later this evening. We plan a week of visiting local historic sights and beauty spots mixed with good food and meeting friends who live here. 21.00 As we are eating with my cousin in a local restaurant, we are told there will be a lockdown from midnight. This is the first we and our local friends have heard of the arrangement. My other two guests arrive to find out about the lockdown and we have a few days with three guests where we aren’t allowed out of the villa except for food shopping or medical reasons. Only one person is allowed out to shop and only to the local shop. We have our dog with us so one person can walk him with 50 metres of the villa. We are lucky to be in an enclosed villa with terraces and a pool because we are confined here with our guests for the foreseeable future. We enjoy outdoor lunches, reading by the pool and board games are pulled out at night. It’s years since we all played “trivial pursuit” and our general knowledge seems no better. 15th March -After a day or two, holiday makers are advised to return home as soon as possible and our guests leave early in fear of their previous flights being cancelled. My husband and I are on lockdown for longer because we have the car, the dog, the golf clubs and three months of holiday stuff to pack into the car to get theferry and our ferry can’t be changed. 20th March -24th April. We live in lockdown for weeks and our ferry at the end of April is cancelled. We manage to book another for the end of May and extend the rental of the villa for another month. 25th April – May We both feel safer in our little bubble of Spain with its strict lockdown rules than in the U.K. where the virus is spreading and the PM is desperately ill too. The U.K. guidelines were put in place two weeks after Spain’s lockdown and, to us, they seem lax. In Spanish shops there are 2 metre distancing markers, masks and gloves and sanitiser and there is a limit on certain items so there is not a shortage. On the news and from friends we see the U.K. is running out of toilet rolls of all things and hand wash. Didn’t we all wash our hands before this? People are stockpiling and U.K. shops are allowing it. We hear the key health workers get to the shops and they’re empty. Every evening at 8 there is music played and clapping from the roof terraces around is for the key workers in the crisis. There are not many people around us as they are mainly second homes and nobody can travel but we hear the music and applause from nearby streets and don’t feel alone. I come to Spain every February to write and enjoy warmer weather than in the U.K. but I find for the first four weeks that Ican’t settle to it. The world seems to have turned upside down and we listen to news for hours just waiting to hear something positive. Eventually we accept that this isn’t going away anytime soon and I start writing again. I write more than normal and finish my current book edits and write a novella too. The novella is about a diphtheria epidemic in a few Northern villages during the winter of 1944 and I empathise with the fear and helplessness of my characters as their children go to an isolation hospital. I discover through my research, that the ‘strangling angel’ of diphtheria was a real threat during the war years and killed more children than German bombs. The vaccine was eventually rolled out in the U.K. so by the end of the 40s this threat had been eradicated. I find myself wondering how long it will take to creat a vaccine for covid-19. My husband is 72 and I’m 68 so we both need medication and we are aware that our travel insurance has run out so it is a worrying time. The travel insurance people agree to extend cover for us and our car but we both need to access medication. Luckily, the local pharmacy orders our tablets without a prescription just on sight of the tablet boxes and we can pay for them ourselves. My tablets are aromatise inhibitors to deter cancer from reoccurring and we pay €92 for a month’s supply but feel grateful we have what we need and relax more about our extended Spanish lockdown. That is until we hear that our ferry has been cancelled for a second time. We decide that we cannot risk another booking and plan our route back through France and the channel tunnel. 11th May -Soon after the lockdown is partially lifted on 11th May, we make our minds up to leave and set off for home on 18th May. We must travel through Spain and France making three overnight stops and we are nervous at the thought of the journey but we want to get back to our own home and nearer to our children and grandchildren. We leave armed with masks, antibacterial wipes, our own sandwiches and a great deal of trepidation. We have 1600 miles to cover over four days before we reach our own front door and all three countries have suffered from the virus so nowhere seems safe. When we arrive home we will self isolate for 14 days and wait to see if we have managed to stay clear of the virus. 22.5.20 Home at last . 5.6.20 Our self imposed quarantine is over but we still can’t see our children or grandchildren. Thank goodness for technology. Govt. They’ve made mistakes but this is a new state of emergency and some of their actions have been excellent. Furlough pay, loans to businesses etc -good. PPE equipment -dire I think the govt is desperate to get the country back to work and the schools open but they have done an excellent job in scaring people into staying home. NEWS – I listen to the daily briefing from the govt. I take their data and latest updates with a pinch of salt. We didn’t know how ill the PM was until later. The Dominic Cummings debacle and the Prof Neil Ferguson breach of his own rules has been depressing. I listen to some BBC and SKY news. I ignore social media because there is always some sort of scare story circulating. BSL interpreters are the best response NS has made. We should have all acted as one nation for lockdown lifting and she has her own agenda. I’m retired from education but I write and do this at home. I’ve written more. Technology I’ve taken exercise classes with my own instructor in real time via zoom. Iaccessed classes in Spain so I had more access than if she had been teaching in my gym. I like not having to drive to a class. Time saving! I’ve spoken to friends and family regularly usingwhatsapp and facetime. I use facebook, twitter and instagram a lot already to promote my novels but ive been on it more. Shopping and Food We shopped in maskes in Spain and followed social distancing In UK we’ve used click and collect to miss out on the shhop exposure. I’ve bought clothes, toiletries and Books online We have started a HelloFresh delivery where the ingredients of three fresh meals are packaged with the recipe and delivered weekly. This is because I was bored with cooking the same old stuff and we get more variety. We used to eat out two or three times in the week. We haven’t used takeaways at all because im not sure how safe that is. Personal Hygeine We have both kept to the same routines. We dress and don’t have pyjama days like my grandkids do. We have both grown our hair over five months (no choice)and my husband has grown a beard but trims it. we havent gone feral. Sleep Terrible at first -Sleepless nights, weird dreams then exhausted and an early night but waking up at 3. I’d just get up and write. My worst vivid dream was that I’d told everyone Iwas fed up with living and I wanted to die. They all agreed and we went on a jaunt in a convoy of old cars to a dignitas place. I was in the car with my current and my ex husband and both were happy with my choice. I kept saying should I do it? and they both said yes you’ve had a good life. Myfriends and family came along in the cars for a sort of a wake rather than a funeral and a party was going on. I couldn’t tell them I’d changed my mind. Nobodywould listen. We were in a strange old house with no locks and I was frightened of sleeping in case I was injected. Iwoke up and didn’t want to go back to sleep in case it started again. I felt unwanted, invisible and surplus to requirements. Since we got to UK we have both slept much better. Relief at being home I tihnk."

The excitement when the blue envelope came through the letterbox! Husbandâ€™s was first, as heâ€™s 6 months older than me, but mine followed a couple of days later. It was so exciting that we have squirrelled away one of the envelopes in our 2021 Year file, a collection of ephemera which tell a story. Our appointments were for the first week in February, at a community centre about 6 miles away. Husbandâ€™s was on the Monday afternoon. That was the day it started to snow. It was also the day theyâ€™d double-booked all appointments for that particular venue, so he was queuing in a blizzard for a couple of hours, and got his picture in the local paper that week -one of a long line of heavily-swathed pensioners huddled against the biting wind.  My appointment was supposed to be on the following Saturday afternoon around teatime; Husband suggested I try to reschedule it or I would be outside in the dark and the cold, if his experience was anything to go by. I rebooked for 0800 on the Thursday, which was a nightmare as the snow kept coming and the ice kept thickening day by day. Husband and neighbours spent Wednesday afternoon chipping all the ice off our drive and the residential road where we live, then throwing salt and sand all over the surfaces, in the hope that weâ€™d be able to get the car out early on Thursday morning. This we did, and made it to the centre half an hour early -no traffic on the cleared main roads!  I was absolutely the first person in the waiting room, and the first to be called forward for my vaccination. I thought Iâ€™d better tell them, as mentioned in the leaflet, that I had a couple of anaphylactic shock episodes, way back in 2009, but that was enough to put them off giving me the Pfizer vaccine. I was absolutely the first person out of the place, at 0805! Having contacted our local GP surgery, I eventually received my vaccine 3 weeks later, on February 25, when a district nurse, seconded from another part of the region, came to the house to administer the Astra-Zeneca one.  I had ten days feeling terrible, with flu-like symptoms, but am so grateful to have been vaccinated. For the second vaccinations in May, Husband went to a new centre, in a disused former Marks & Spencer store in our local townâ€™s high street. Again, I was given mine at home by a nurse, having got myself unwittingly on to the list of Poor Old Souls Who Have To Be Visited At Home. Thankfully I suffered few side-effects after this one. We waited a full three weeks after my second vaccination then felt able to go out and about in society a bit more, returning to (socially-distanced masked) church services. We came out of our self-imposed semi-isolation just in time for the rules to be relaxed so that people could come into our house and could actually stay in the house: Daughter J andGranddaughter A, whom we hadnâ€™t seen since February 2020, came up from Birmingham at the end of May and were able to stay with us for a few days. What joy! We have definitely been keeping to all the rules, partly because itâ€™s in our nature, I suppose. Also, Husband did a lot of work on pandemic flu precautions and procedures when he was at work, as part of his health and safety remit; he has been responsible for Risk Assessments for local church buildings during the pandemic, and is still doing it, as the situations keep changing with the relaxation of regulations. Another reason for particular caution personally is that I have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome since 1993, following a virus, and from the start the reports of long Covid sounded suspiciously like the way I felt back then. I am slightly better now but was 42 then and a lot more able to pick up than I would be now I am in my 70th year! As it is, if I get anything in the way of an infection, even a slight cold, the symptoms abate but I am left drained and exhausted for weeks afterwards, so we were very keen not to get Covid. I have no concerns about safety of vaccines, and believe in taking everything we are offered by the medics who know more than we do. H6675 F 69 married Kinghorn, Fife Former building society cashier Spring directive 2021:  The Covid-19 vaccine (cont) I am not sure how I feel about Vaccine Passports but can see how they would help in certain situations. It wouldnâ€™t affect me much as I donâ€™t go to other countries, or do large sporting or cultural events. Having seen how vaccination has eradicated smallpox and mitigated the effects of so many formerly-deadly infections, I can see the logic in making vaccination compulsory for all but those with particular medical conditions which would make it risky. Daughter J has Covid at the moment, having been double-vaccinated. She has been marooned in the spare bedroom for more than a week, with meals left outside her door by her self-isolating husband and daughter, communicating by FaceTime and Zoom with them and with the rest of the herfamily andfriends. Vaccination doesnâ€™t prevent you catchingit; it just meansthat itâ€™s a milddose with, we hope, no nasty effects.  As Covid is something weâ€™re going to have to learn to live with, the more folk are vaccinated the better it will be for society."

Make a note of the item and the room in your house that it came from.lx prepared mash potato cardboard slip - kitchen lx prepared mash potato plastic tray - kitchen2x tin trays (mine beef and onion pie) - kitchenlx comic mailer envelope (corrugated cardboard)- opened in the kitchen!Recycling at homeWhat items of waste do you recycle at home and where do you keep them? How are they organised? How does this relate to your outdoor bins?Are there any items you keep to re-use?Thinking about the items of waste you recycle at home, how do you know that these items are recyclable? Are there any that you are uncertain about?How did you treat these items before putting them in the bin? For example, did you wash or take any of them apart?Generally all recycling is put into the outside recycling bin each day. Sometimes a small pile of boxes and plastic containers will accumulate next to the microwave before being taken.It is a small kitchen area so there isn't anywhere suitable for things to remain for long although the washing basket has been known to be used to corral various cardboard mailers that arrive fairly regularly.All food items have been washed/rinsed prior to going out and any bottles or other drink containers have been allowed to stand upended in the small side basin until dry.Pump action soap dispensers are usually given a little bit of water in order to get the maximum use out of them before being replaced. They are also washed out and the screwed in plunger part is often kept for the new bottle (or act as a replacement for broken dispensers).Most items do not present much of a challenge and everything usually goes into the recycling bin as the scope of allowed items has increased.It would help though if they listed the allowed recycling material codes (the number inside the triangle) and not just give typical examples as that doesn't guarantee the material used.Recycling collectionsHow is recycling collected in your area? Where is it collected from? How regularly is it collected?Are there different processes for paper and card, different plastics, tins, glass, textiles, food and garden waste etc?Has this changed in recent years? If so, how?Do you regularly take items to communal facilities like bottle or textile banks? If so, how do you get there? How regularly do you visit this facility?Leaving aside general waste, are there any items that you don't recycle? What stops you?In my area the household recycling is collected every fortnight (on a Tuesday). There is a dedicated recycle bin that we have to wheel to the top of the driveway. In our area this bin is a grey/silver in colour and can be used for a wide variety of materials including glass.We have also been given these small green lidded caddies {a square bucket with a handle) that were supposed to be used for food waste and be kept in the kitchen. These require a liner {not supplied) and are near useless and occupy far too much floor area. It has the same footprint as a kitchen bin but is very short making it a real tripping hazard.The accumulated contents of these bins is supposed to go in with the garden waste {brown bin) and were instigated by a local politician. You can use them without a liner but that does present other problems with decaying waste in the kitchen depending on how often you empty them into the brown bin and how much actual food waste you produce.Other than this there has been no change in the way recycling is undertaken in our area. Facilities for disposing of oil, chemicals and electrical appliances have always been available at the local Waste and Recycling Centre. However getting there has always been an issue as it is situated on a stretch of road that is on the periphery of the town. This access has recently become even harder when the luxury car plant was allowed to expand and absorb the one through road to the Waste and Recycling Centre. So access to it now requires you to approach it from the external side of the town.Why recycle?What motivates you to recycle? For instance, do you relate this to being environmentally responsible, to the climate, to reducing waste, or something else? What has influenced these motivations?Are there any times that you have made a special effort to recycle? Or are there any times where you haven't been able to recycle?What do you think happens to your recycling once it is collected? Do you think good use is made of it?It seems a worthwhile thing to do.I also find it fun in reducing packing down to its component items and folding it all flat. This also maks,for better use of the bin as you can get far more in there. Once whilst visiting my mother I saw a neighbour's teenage child actually stand in the recycle bin in order to compress the contents {no attempt had been made to fold the contents flat but he wasn't the most intelligent of kids).In some ways I have always recycled. Well I'm more of a hoarder but I usually reuse containers or protective bags to keep others things safe and boxes/padded envelopes get reused all the time.As for their eventual reuse...Well I think that glass is obviously reused but I believe that it may not be recycled by colour so it may become a brown glass or form an ingredient in some form a building material.Card/paper will become a lower grade material and most likely be for packing or cardboard. Metals are an easy one with ferrous metals being easier to extract and others are probably agitated out at a granular stage after being shredded. Unlike card this material can now be purified.Plastics I'm not sure about. They would require a lot of manual labour to separate into their categories before being turned into pellets for eventual remoulding.Shopping choicesDo you ever make shopping choices based on whether something can be recycled or is made from recycled materials?No, not that I can recall.I do look at food items where you can refill but I usually find this to be a fool's errand. Usually the refill is either cheaper (but contains far less so is actually more expensive - coffee suffers from that anomaly) or the range does not encompass the products I actually use.Pump displaced soap has been bought as refills from time to time. I have noticed that the pumps from the smaller containers may fit onto the new larger size bottles the tube that actually goes into the soap is actually too short to reach the bottom. The only workaround for this was to drain the larger bottle into the smaller one.And finally...Looking back over the past year, do you think your recycling habits have changed as a result of Covid-19?I really don't think my habits regarding recycling have changed at all.The purchases have remained the same so the amount and disposal of the recycling has therefore remained consistent.If anything I have used mail-order more for publications as I couldn't go and get things as easily so there are far more in the way of cardboard mailer envelopes now going into the recycling bin."

MASS OBS NUMBER 3412; FEMALE; 62; MARRIED; RETIRED TEACHER; MONPAZIER, FRANCE. Living through the pandemic as a retiree in a rural corner of south west France has been a very different experience to that lived by many people in towns and cities ­particularly people in Britain rather than France. The pandemic has had very little overall impact; life has carried on much as normal ­with ‘attestations’ during the lockdown, giving a valid reason for being out and about and of course a limitation on socialising. It has been rather like a time of gentle hibernation and, as such, there has been very little need to be tested. Obviously travel has been much curtailed but, grasping the opportunity last October as one confinement ended, we did travel to Zambia to see our daughters and their families. This and the return were the only occasions on which I was tested. • It began with a visit to the local GP and a request for an ordnance (prescription) for a covid test for ‘reasons of travel’. • I then went to a test centre in Perigueux (an hour away), specifically at a time for those without symptoms to be tested. • We all queued outside for about 20 minutes, all wearing masks and at one metre distance from each other. • I presented my prescription at one of the half dozen booth areas open at a counter and handed over my ‘cartevitale’ -the health card you have to use for any medical intervention. • Next was a 10 minute wait in the seating waiting area, before my name being called and following the nurse to a small room. • I sat back in the chair and had the testing swab pushed up first one then the other nostril. It is a decidedly unpleasant experience and, as so many people have said before, you feel as if your brains are going to be extracted. But it is very quick. • It is also free! • A swift ‘merci beaucoup, bonne journée’ and that was that. The results were available online the next day via Novobio, the laboratories which process all medical tests. I already have my personal code for access to this lab and it is a very straightforward and simple process to navigate your way around its system. • This time we were in Lusaka and went along to the Victoria Hospital in town. • The waiting area was an open sided tent in the car park, with half a dozen chairs. • We presented our passports and (although I can’t quite remember) I think our flight reservations to show why we needed a test. • After a wait of about 10 minutes (it was a quiet time -at other times you could be waiting much longer) I was called into an office, where the nurse was waiting. I handed over my 2,500 kwacha fee (about £100) • She examined my slip of paper and my passport again, before sitting me in a chair and asking me to put my head back. • Again the swab in both nostrils, painful of course, but again quick; and the nurse very sweetly apologising all the time for hurting me! • As we were not in town the next day, we sent someone to the hospital on our behalf, with a signed note giving him permission to collect our results. For our return flight from Zambia we obviously had to show another negative test. And that is the sum total of my personal experience of tests. I see their necessity and I certainly felt safer on the planes, knowing everyone else on board also had to have had a negative result. I think they are a vital tool in protecting everyone around. I did not hesitate for a moment to be tested -it was the only way I was going to see my daughters, sons in law and grandchildren. I would not hesitate to be tested again, if I needed to travel. However, as I read in The Times this morning, I think it’s disgraceful how much money is charged in Britain for compulsory testing, even for those double vaccinated. I’m glad I live here, where the tests are free. I do not have lateral flow tests in the house; neither have I self-administered any other diagnostic test. Obviously, living where I do, I have no direct experience of the British test and trace system. However, I do have the ‘Tous Anti Covid’ (the French equivalent) app on my phone. This gives daily updated statistics on numbers of infections nationally and regionally, numbers of hospital admissions and numbers of those in intensive care (again, nationally and regionally.) It also shows numbers of those vaccinated. The app tells you if you have been in contact with anyone infected; at least, it is supposed to, but I’m not sure how that works. I have never been warned or told to isolate. (But numbers here are very low and, as I said, our socialising has been limited.) My husband, after a trip to Britain to see his elderly mother, was identified by the app as having been abroad and told to isolate, but with the provision that, if he didn’t feel poorly, he needn’t bother! I also have my vaccination status on my Tous Anti Covid app -it was very simple to take a picture of the QCR code and upload it to the app. I now have to show this proof of double vaccination for entry to theatres, concert venues etc and for any outdoor event with over a certain number of people present. I know you are asking about the actual testing, but I also thoroughly approve of this idea of showing proof that you are vaccinated and protected. It helps everyone to be that bit safer."

Working at home in my job is quite straightforward, given when I was in my offices I would use the same laptop that I’m currently using and many of my team that I speak to most often are spread across Britain anyway.  Before this I’d often spend a lot of time on-the-go, travelling to meetings, my two offices in south Wales or the one in London, to see friends etc. During the lockdown (particularly in the first phases) a lot more things have been happening remotely via technology, both work and personal contact. This time ‘saved’ has allowed me to do more: e.g. activities like cooking that I enjoy; time to rest; house jobs or DIY; and allowed some aspects of my life to slow down. That said, the daily anxieties of the outbreak and spending a lot of time in front of screens has left me feeling tired and a bit foggy more of the time. The change has allowed me to try some new activities/classes/events though as I’ve been able to dial into them online rather than trying to fit in travelling to a new place to do an activity. We’ve spent more time in our local area for obvious reasons. We were always quite rooted here as we’re quite centrally located and have access to cafes/restaurants/pubs, local shops and parks but these have become even more important to us lately. That said, we used to do more travelling (both within UK/abroad), day trips to surrounding areas for walks or city visits etc so we’ve tried to recreate those experiences by trying a new takeaway/delivery for food, and watching travel programmes and documentaries.  It’s really remarkable how little it rained during the lockdown, only a handful of times. We’re both generally quite active so we’ve been trying to go for a walk every day with some longer walks from the house on the weekends. The weather has been really good over summer 2020, so that has made things a lot easier. During our walks we enjoyed the weather and it did mostly feel like spring and summer. We had a number of different types of walks, such as more physically active with hills, strolls in parks, quieter or busier streets, or walks to go via shops on the way around. As a result we started to take more notice of plants, animals in the street or in people’s windows, and building features. In some cases we’ve taken photos of plants to try to find out their names and either admired historical features on buildings or taken photos or mental pictures of those too as inspiration for potential changes to our own home.  I’m a keen cyclist too and my bike/s have been a lifeline to keep active and also to see different places from my immediate local area. It’s given me easy access to beaches/seaside and hills but also with the quieter roads during the lockdown I’ve explored the wider city and seen and documented (with videos and photos) the effect of the lockdown on the rhythms of city life. As the lockdown eased too it has given me social opportunities. Before lockdown friends and I would go cycling and then go for a pub pint or a coffee, and while we haven’t done so many group rides until very recently, we started meeting up for a coffee outside before going to work. That sense of normality of doing something separate from work or home life was refreshing and it allowed me to get out on my own also. One of my early anxieties with the lockdown was that days would lose their meaning and that I’d be in more of a routine. On my first day working solely at home (mid March) I started to keep a short diary, quite practically focused, just to make sure each day was given some extra significance at least in the diary. Before lockdown I’d plan our meals in advance a bit and we have a small blackboard in the kitchen where I write down our ‘menu’ for the week. That has been a real help as it’s given us something to look forward to and also practically helped us manage our resources as I was making only weekly trips to the local shops for supplies. Ordinarily we’d go to the same shops but more often so there was room to be more spontaneous before. As a result I think I am able to recall individual days because of what we ate that day. Mealtimes have also introduced a new rhythm to our days and we’ve eaten lunch and most other meals together. It has ensured I’m taking more of a lunch break not long after midday most days as I have more access to other activities than I would’ve in the office, e.g. going out to our garden, watching TV, or doing some light housework. The only thing that disrupts that plan a bit is if either of us has a work meeting. It’s also given us a chance to chat about how our work days are going and it means that when we get to the evening we sometimes talk a bit more but we have more time in the evenings to talk about other things. Our walks have given us more time to chat about things as well. We’re fortunate to have a lot of space and not really any home caring responsibilities beyond our cat. Writing in September, this is due to continue as my partner’s employer isn’t rushing to have people back and I’m responsible for my own office (with only two others in it) and we’re not looking to go back much before Christmas 2020.    Despite using technology a lot more during the lockdown I’ve also started using a paper notepad for work. Previously, as I mentioned before, I was often in different offices and places during the week and it wasn’t that practical to carry around a notepad with me. And when I did try that previously I’d often forget it or not have enough space in my bag, so would inevitably end up with lots of sheets of loose paper and notes scrawled on other documents. But being in one place has allowed me to go back to the future and keep a notepad. We’ve bought a robot vacuum cleaner during lockdown. As we were home more often, and we have a cat, we ended up having to do more cleaning. In the end we splashed out on an automated vacuum to keep on top of things, so we only need to put the manual vacuum cleaner around less often for a deeper clean. I’ve noticed people feeling a bit fatigued by spending so much time on screens/teleconferences and conscious that it’s not quite as good as face-to-face contact. I’ve felt that a bit too. There are some aspects of my life that feel a little bit ‘on hold’ at the moment. We like to travel and like many others had to cancel plans. It’s on my mind as I spent quite a busy few years working hard and now feel ready for a bigger break but am not able to take a longer one. We managed to get away for a few days elsewhere in the UK (within 2hrs drive) that was very refreshing. I’ve also been casually looking at other work roles recently, as I do feel ready to move on. Things have been ridiculously busy this year and for my previous years in my current job and some of the same obstacles are starting to get to me a bit. I’m ready for a bit more career progression having dedicated myself to progressing projects.  Waiting to see family early on was harder than I expected. We were counting down to the dates when non-local travel was permitted in Wales (I think it was early July from memory) and we saw both sets of parents (in England) very early on. The hardest moment was when a maternal aunt died very unexpectedly and she lived abroad, so my mum wasn’t able to see family and we weren’t able to see her. We took part in the funeral and burial service remotely and a family member arranged for it to be live-streamed to family abroad and those who couldn’t make the ceremonies in person. They’re in quite a different time zone, so it was in the middle of the night but felt weirdly like a communal and helpful experience. It was the closest we could get to supporting my mum as well. I’ve always tried to avoid queuing when I can. I often live at quite a pace and I don’t like it but I am a scrupulous queuer who gets annoyed with people who don’t queue ‘properly’ by standing at 2m distance and/or making sure they take notice of others more generally. I also didn’t like busy places at the best of times, less so during the pandemic. As a result I tend to do our food shopping early or late, when the local shops are much quieter and feel safer. I don’t understand why people who don’t have to go to shops on a busy Saturday do so. The shops are very busy where we live and there’s often a queue to get in."

So I will simply describe the whole process as part of this late entry. My first dose was administered on 27/01/2021 & I received it so early because I am a front line worker who cannot work from home.  I was called on my day off & asked if I wanted to go & have my vaccine as it had been offered to front line  staff due to 8 people declining to have it on the day, so it was all very last minute. I was picked up 2 hours later by a colleague & we travelled to Westpoint arena at Clyst St. Mary near Exeter.  We were give a number & name of an HR contact to give as we were checked in & told to take work ID.  West point had only opened to do vaccinations the day before so we were very fortunate to be some of the first to go there.  I felt guilty though to be having my jab before my Partner who was 75 & had yet to be called in for hers.  We parked & went to the main door & were asked a series of questions about our health, our temperature was scanned & our hands squirted with antibacterial gel.  We then went in & were booked in & told to go through into the main hall & queue.  Considering that it was 13:00 I was amazed to find hardly anyone in there & went straight to the front where I was asked more questions & issued with my vaccine card on which was written the date & Astra Zeneca, which I was pleased to see.  I went into a cubicle & an NHS nurse gave me the jab & I then waited 15 minutes before we both drove back to Sidmouth & I was dropped off at home.  An hour after I got home my Partner received a call from the surgery & her vaccine was booked for the following Sunday at Exmouth Tennis Centre. Her vaccine was arranged through the surgery & was administered by her own retired GP. Other than a slight headache & feeling a bit rough the next day I was fine, but 2 of my colleagues had terrible headaches overnight & had to miss work the next day.  My Partner had Pfizer and suffered a much worse headache which lasted for about 48 hours. In April I was advised that I needed to have my 2nd vaccine so booked my appointment online on the Government website which was very simple.  I booked it for the 15th of April at 08:00 & this time my Partner drove me in.  The process was exactly the same but it was much busier even at 08:00 with a mix of people having fist & second jabs.  We were told by a friend to take a couple of Paracetamol before we went as it eased the headaches, so I did & it was good advice as I had little to no side effect at all. I had AstraZeneca again & again it was administered by an NHS nurse.  The only side effect was a very painful arm & pain up into the shoulder & neck on the side of the injection. My Partner was called by the surgery & went back to the Exmouth Tennis Centre for her jab on the 16th April also at 08:00 & again it was much busier.  The vaccine was administered again by her retired GP & likewise she had no headache after but did have a painful arm for several days. Even now we are still being very careful when we do go out in public which is not often.  We still keep a distance & always wear a mask indoors in public places. We have been on a train in October to see my Aunt on her birthday & both wore masks on the train at all times & in the taxi. Although the train company asked people to wear masks only a few of the mainly older passengers did.  I still have to wear a mask in all mixed areas at work but not in our control room itself.  We moved from an individual building to the main council offices in July so now have to work in an open plan office, with no opening windows or fresh air.  Not ideal at all so I am very careful, & enormously grateful to have been vaccinated.  I again booked online for both of us to go & have our booster on the 27th October this time at the newly constructed Greendale site near Woodbury. We had an 8 Oâ€™clock appointment & the procedure was the same.  We had to produce our cards & proof of booking on our phones.  This time we both had Comirnaty (Pfizer) which was a first for me, so I was given a leaflet to read.  We both took Paracetamol before again & after answering the usual questions about general health & if we had tested positive recently we received the jab again from NHS nurses & after 15 minutes came home. This time we both felt pretty awful, thumping headaches & aching all over, very painful arm, shoulder & neck again.  But after 48 hours we felt better again & as I had it done while I was on annual leave I did not have to take time off work. I have no worries about the vaccines safety & we both feel so blessed to live in a country where so many have been able to receive it so quickly, it was I feel one of the few things that the Government managed to get right."

There are tacit ones, driven by tangible events, such as before school, after school and dinner.  Dinner is a variable, the others not.  I have tried to book time in my calendar for lunch, though this is varied in quality and duration.  Most are into the house for a sandwich and back to the desk.  Through October there were a few lunches out with my wife.  This section has been compiled after the ‘Waiting’ section below, which I have not edited.    My work takes priority, over the internet connection and space in the house, I am the only income of the household (by choice) and I have been seen to be a little prissy when conference calls have been ruined by my children playing bandwidth hungry games between 4 and 6pm.    Depending on new lockdowns (today is November 2nd, we have a one month one that begins on Thursday, but children continue to school) I suspect in our household we have made the adjustments we need, as it relates to space and access to technology.  I have moved to our garden office/gym/outside space, which has internet, so I am a little isolated, in my own bubble.    Time in general is ruled by school, work and children’s recreational activities.  During the earlier lockdown evenings were our own again with do need to ferry children about.  This has returned, until this week, where we have needed to be a little more organised.    I’ve noticed I shave less, and I wear more informal clothes than I would have done prior to COVID-19.  I have worn jeans and shorts through all of march to today (Nov 2nd).  I suspect my trousers and shirts will go under utilised until a return to the office.        04521 Due to work projects I took to booking personal time between 6 and 9pm to protect some personal time through June – September, this wasn’t very successful, but I can state that work did take all the time allocated to it, and more.  Things have slackened off a little now, thankfully.    Media and technology    There have been a few mundane changes in our household.  Primarily we switched to ‘click and collect’ shopping from our local supermarket.  We had not done so until this year and I’m pleased that the service exists.  Supermarkets are essentially the breeding ground for science experiments and extinction of the stupid experiments.  No rules, limited decorum and overwhelmed, yet well intended staff.  Click and collect allowed for orders to be made on line and picked up without entering the store, thus reducing human contact.      We have also bolstered our household technology through online purchases.  I have ordered equipment for the children and my own ‘office environment’ a space that did not exist before lockdown.  Most of it will retain use for years, so it’s not money wasted in my opinion.    The growth of collaborative platforms such as Zoom should be recognised and Zoom is quickly becoming the common noun (and verb) for video conferencing.  The first product to become a sector noun since Google became the verb for internet search.  I have zoomed with friends and we have deployed the technology to our village football club allowing us to have virtual monthly meetings.  This is a first in the 20 years the club has existed, in fact we are sticking with it for now.  The technology works well and to that end I am grateful for it.      Waiting    Thankfully nor I and those dear to me have been unwell as a result of this madness.  However, on a personal note life absolutely feels like it’s been put on hold. I have put off and found myself waiting for many things.    Dentist:  My original check-up was for march this year; I have a check-up once every nine months.  This has thankfully been rescheduled to September the 14th, so it will be 15 months since I’ve had my teeth checked.  As it happens, I think they are ok, nothing to report.    Nov 2nd.  The above turned out not to be true.  I needed a filling in my lower left 7.  This was a fete of major engineering on the part of my dentist.  The check-up and the     04521  filling were performed in an environment a heart surgeon would have felt familiar in.  The controls to access the surgery, including waiting in the car, a temperature check, signing two wavers and cleaning hands twice before sitting down insured: 1, I was probably safe and 2, not going to take this anything but seriously.  That I needed a filling upset me greatly.  Back in the chair 2 weeks later after the check up for 45 minutes was not where I wanted to be.  Kudos to the dentist and the wider staff, they were lovely.    Haircut:  I had my last haircut first week of March.  This will be the longest I have gone without a haircut possibly ever.  I think I look like Don Johnson in the US ‘cop show’ Miami Vice, a hit in the 80’s.  My wife thinks I look like a cross of Robert Peston (political commentator) and Jarvis Cocker (singer in pop band Pulp).  Neither is particularly complementary.  I might get my hair cut tomorrow (Aug 29th).  It is long.  I have adopted a curtain look, way too much grey and the hair on the back of my head is starting to flail about.    It should be noted that I did manage a haircut a week later it took years off me and my wife talked to me more.  I will not repeat this follicle escapade again.  I will ask for clippers this Christmas to keep the hair on my head in check for the remainder of COVID-19 life    Eating/drinking out:  Not done so since February, so 6 months.  I have no desire to eat in a restaurant either, the experience would be too strange for me and why do I need a mask in a shop, but not a food retailer, it makes no sense.    Travel:  I have not been on a plane for nearly 11 months (now 13), the longest time since 1997.  I have not been to London since January, the longest since 1990.  I took a day’s holiday on Monday, the first this year, probably the longest time since 1997.  We went to the seas side – Wells-net-to-the-sea, in Norfolk.  The town was mobbed, I queued 30 minutes for the car park ticket machine, everyone was pretty relaxed about it.  This is the first daytrip we have had since October last year.    General info:  Village life has changed, we have all queued for many things, including access to shops, which I would not expect normally where we live.  Queues and masks have challenged many, me included.  I have seen queues run for 100’s of metres in the formative weeks of lock down to enter our village co-op.  They’ve mostly gone now, though the smaller shops, with greater restrictions on numbers still have them – our green grocers will only take 3 customers in the shop at any time and our butchers 4.    Work:  This has not stopped, we switched to home working and this will continue into the new year, so 9 months at least.  To that end I have not worked from my employer’s office for 9 months.  I don’t miss this, our environment was poor, open plan, noisy, presenteeism based.  I do miss contact with those whose company I enjoyed and not in my immediate sphere of interaction."

I got my first dose on the first of Feb 2021. This was very early considering that I am only 47! I was working all through the second lockdown in a school environment and working with vulnerable students. As a local authority there were some spare vaccines at the local hospital but you had to attend at odd hours but I was quite happy to do this. I will be getting my second dose next Monday (19/4/2021). A lot of my fellow teachers (who only taught using Zoom and were under lockdown) were really quite angry that I was able to get the vaccine. I went to the local hospital and I took my colleague in the car, who does not drive, with me. I am sure we were not supposed to go together...but we did or else she would not be able to get the jab. The hospital is only 4 miles from where I live. It was administered by hospital staff. The set up was very good and very well organised. There were a lot of people and, given we were under proper lockdown it felt slightly scary but it was OK. There were lots of people there to put you at ease. You were strongly encouraged to squirt your hands with gel. You then had to fill in a form with as much information as you could. I received the Pfizer Vaccine. I felt absolutely fine afterwards and had no side effects (much to wifeâ€™s annoyance. She felt very bad after her jab!). I am doing exactly as I did before. I go out as infrequently as possible. I always wear a mask. For work I have to do a lateral flow test twice a week and I am only allowed to come in to work if it is negative. This information goes to track and trace. When going out I will always take my own hand sanitizer (it has a lovely smell and is not greasy). I give very little thought about the guidelines and restrictions because on the few times I go out there are so many people who are not following any guidelines that it just does not matter. I will not be going to pubs or meeting up with lots of people. If people want to put themselves at risk that is fine so I will just look after myself. Again, it is a moot point as to whether the vaccine is safe or not. I think that so many people (30 million?) having the vaccine with side effects being one in a million. There are side effects with every drug and I wish people would understand that. There is a much greater risk in not having the vaccine. I think the vaccine seems to be rolled out well in my area, but it is a city and places are relatively easy to get to. There seem to be lots of sign posts around to get to places, lots of GPâ€™s surgeries and pharmacies are being used. It seems to be good. I got my information about the vaccine from the vaccine centre itself. They gave you a little booklet but also encouraged you to go onto the government website if there were any other questions you had about the vaccine. What really depresses me is the amount of airtime that people who are against vaccines, for whatever reason, get on the radio and TV. It is not a balanced argument and a lot of them are just plain wrong. But if you give them so much airtime then people will start to question the vaccine and then less people will take it. The information is there if only people would educate themselves and look for it. MO P5366 Male, 47, Married, Portsmouth, Teacher I am also getting sick and tired about the discussion of â€˜vaccine passportsâ€™. Even the idea of them is abhorrent. They are very divisive and possibly discriminatory. The whole point of having a vaccine is that you yourself are unlikely to get the disease. However there is a possibility that you could carry the virus. There are some people who are unable to have vaccines (immunosuppressed for example) and so this is why you try to get herd immunity. The very idea of having a piece of paper that â€˜provesâ€™ you have had the vaccine, proves nothing. It just shows that you have a piece of paper. I am sure that if they become real then you will just need the paper (easily faked I imagine) and not the actual vaccine, which is the important thing! And there will always be people who will go into a crowd, will have the disease (either knowingly or unknowingly) and they will spread it. If everyone behaved properly then disease would be easily controlled. Vaccination should always be done by consent and trust. They are, without doubt, a common good. If you look at polio, small pox, TB these disease and now very rare in the world mainly due to vaccination and science yet some people want to undermine this. It is down to the choice of the individual balanced against your social responsibility to the many. I myself didnâ€™t really want the vaccine but I, like many others, saw it as my duty to have it mainly to protect me but also to protect others, others that I may never know! I think this is a question of education and with society becoming very much focussed on the individual there are less people willing to help out their own society in a selfless way and this is very sad. Needless to say...I have not booked a foreign holiday this year. In fact I havenâ€™t booked any holiday at all."

I had a hard time deciding if I would have it or not. I am currently breastfeeding and the advice for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding changed at the point the vaccine became available to women who might fall into those categories. From what I could tell, the change in policy was mainly prompted by lobbying rather than a change in scientific advice, which made me nervous. The reason why women who are pregnant or breastfeeding canâ€™t take most over the counter medication is that it hasnâ€™t been tested so there is no data. This seemed to be the same situation, but rather than telling people not to have the vaccine, the message was suddenly â€˜thereâ€™s no data to say itâ€™s dangerous so have itâ€™. This made me quite suspicious and wasnâ€™t helped by different people in the medical profession giving me different advice. In the end, I decided to have it as a read a study that confirmed antibodies produced in repose to the Pfizer vaccine did transfer into the breastmilk and would therefore offer my little by some protection. When my appointment arrived, it was scheduled for the same day as my husbandâ€™s. I decided to change my appoint me time as I didnâ€™t want us to risk having side effects on the same day. I rang up to change my appointment and was thrown by the fact I was being offered times on that day or the next. In the end I booked it for a week after my husbands. The vaccination centre is in a sports hall about 10 â€“ 15 minutes bike ride away. I got on my bike for the first time since having my baby and headed down for my appointment at 10am on a Sunday. It was a lovely sunny day, but was such hard work cyclying for the first time in over a year! The centre was pretty quite when I arrived and I was able to go in 10 minutes early. There were maybe 3 people in front of me in the que and another 3 behind me. There was a bit of a nervous energy to the que as no one really knew what was happening. I was also surprised to see some army personnel helping out directing people. Although, the people giving directions outside the centre were all council workers. I was directed into a big hall and told to sit infront of a small cubical which basically included someone at a computer and two chairs. I only had to wait a few minutes before it was my turn. A couple of quick questions to ensure I was the right person and then a quick jab and done. I was then directed to sit in a different part of the room for 15 minutes to make sure there was no reaction. There wasnâ€™t, so I cycled home. I had a sore arm for a couple of days, but otherwise, no bad side effects. Since having the vaccine, I have kind of been following the guidelines, but where things are beginning to loosen up Iâ€™ve been finding it quite difficult to keep up with that is and isnâ€™t permissible. I donâ€™t really think the vaccine makes me invincible. Maybe Iâ€™ll feel different after the second one, but to me, vaccines mean that you either donâ€™t get something or donâ€™t get it as badly. When success means that you donâ€™t die from an illness, it means that I could still end up in hospital. Iâ€™m not in a high-risk category, so Iâ€™m not overly worried about becoming really ill, but still. Summer Directive 2020 S4002 Female, 41 Married, Cardiff Manager The vaccine in our area, like most places, was rolled out by age. I think this was the wrong choice. I can easily work from home and control who I spend time with so it made no sense to me that I would receive the vaccine before some key workers. I need my kidâ€™s teacher to be in school and would happily have given up my place for a key worker had I been given the choice. Iâ€™m against mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports. Especially for people to travel abroad. At the moment, I donâ€™t think there should be much foreign travel, especially as there are still countries where the virus is running rampant. I also think it is really ridiculous for people to travel not to expect to self isolate for 10 days when they get back. And to act surprised when the rules change. Itâ€™s almost like we arenâ€™t dealing with a virus that canâ€™t be controlled by human beings."
