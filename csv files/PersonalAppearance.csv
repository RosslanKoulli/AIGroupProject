A healthy body. Me when I was younger. Me, I was fit, healthy, not ill very often and only then with a cold. I was flexible, toned and looked after my body, physically and nutritionally. I was slim and fit right into my 50s. I do still look after my body, physically and nutritionally but age has taken its toll. Identity My daughters say I affected their view of diet as I was always on a diet, counting calories, keeping fit. We had a variety of famous people issuing fitness videos e.g. Jane Fonda and Cher (both of which I had) encouraging us to ‘go for the burn’ which we now know is wrong. I only weighed 7.5 stone, so my obsession was silly and my daughters do blame me for their feelings about weight and diet. I do not think social class had anything to do with it, many of the females in those days were the same, also regardless of ethnicity. Of course, there was feminism and who were we doing it for, men! Although I really think I was, and am, doing it for myself as I always want to look the best I can. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My parents certainly were not influenced by these words as they went through WW2 and were living on rations. I do think the nutritionists who created the diet for the rationing did a good job. Almost everyone was thin and healthy! When they married, my Dad was a farmhand, so we had milk straight from the cow and eggs still warm from the chicken. He grew his own vegetables, we lived in the country and were out all the time in the fresh air. No snacks, hardly any sweets. So unbeknown to us, we were living an extremely healthy life. We did not even think about it, although my brother and I say we were often hungry. We were poor. I did not really become aware of dieting until I was in my twenties which would have been in the seventies. I could not live without mascara, which would come with me to the desert island (not that I would ever want to go to a desert island…) November 2020 L7499 Female 69; Divorced; Thurnby, Leicestershire; Floral Designer/Semi-retired Getting ready to leave the house My Mum did not work properly as a wife (she had been in the Land Army in the war and worked in an office previously) until we were teenagers and then worked in the evenings in a lighting factory. She stayed at home and looked after us. I cannot really remember her having any ritual as such. She just got her coat and went, perhaps added some lipstick. My Dad got up in the early hours to milk the cows. He came home for breakfast with us then went out again. So, I did not really see any rituals, other than when he went to play football in his long shorts, he would give my Mum a kiss before he left. My own routine is showering, cup of coffee, read emails, write diary, leave for work. However, my work is now in my office at home nearly all the time as I lost a lot of the work where I would go into a business centre to cover due to Covid-19. In addition, I have started a new business as a floral designer because there is too much competition being a Virtual Assistant and I wanted to do something more creative and fulfilling. I have always had flowers in my house and enjoyed arranging them. I am doing a floristry course to assist with this. It is definitely different and I will spend less time in the office, more time being creative in my kitchen! So my routine is changing. November 2020"

Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). Part 2:  Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? For me, “health” represents the physical body – joints, organs, muscles etc, while “wellbeing” is a state of mind: if our body is injured it can affect our feeling of wellbeing, while – for most – a reduction in our wellbeing doesn’t usually lead to a physical manifestation. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. . Pain-free . Working . Normal . Individual . Regular Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. No particular person comes to mind, just someone who, for their age, is reasonably well with no serious health concerns. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I am aware that some ethnic groups are at greater risk of specific health issues, as are many who, for whatever reason, are on low incomes or reliant on benefits. I count myself as working class but am fortunate that when I worked, my lifestyle was such that I was able to pay into a private pension so I will have some money to contribute to elder care when/if required. Certainly I do feel that my gender – female – has brought me specific health issues in the past that are likely to have had a long-lasting detrimental effect on my health Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). now. Specifically, fertility treatment in the 1980s which left me with ovarian cysts and endometriosis, leading to a hysterectomy at age 33, with removal of last ovary at 49. A sedentary (office) job, and a genetic disposition to low obesity levels (most females on my mother’s side were short and apple-shaped) have given me high blood-pressure and I am classed as pre-diabetic. I have never smoked, though my mother smoked (while pregnant), as did all her siblings. None live to see their 70th birthdays, so I do have a concern about lingering passive smoking effects. I consider myself reasonable healthy for my age, though a bad back and knee (after a fall in 2010) limit the exercise I can do, I do attempt Pilates (not as often as when there were ‘live’ classes), I walk a mile most days, and we have now dug-out our old Nintendo Wii-Fit for those days when the weather is too wet and windy to venture outside. Gardening has helped immensely with plenty of physical activity in the fresh air this year, and I am lucky that I have the time and the space (though small) to grow some vegetables. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I’ve always been aware of my own health (you name a childhood disease, I probably had it) but “wellbeing” seems to have come to prominence only in the last ten years. I remember in work, there was a lot of discussion about taking personal responsibility for your own wellbeing (the inference being that if you didn’t and then had a lot of time of work with ‘mental health’ issues, this would not be an acceptable reason for them NOT to get rid of you). Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? In reality, it was my mother. My father hated illness, it annoyed him. But when I was a child, everyone looked to their GP as the final authority on health. We were lucky, our GP was very ‘child friendly’, which meant he gave us sweets (a luxury) after an injection. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). Not really. Maybe in primary school. The nit-nurse came once a year; and maybe the school dentist told us about brushing our teeth. Secondary School biology classes taught us (girls only) about periods. Otherwise it was all “eat everything on your plate. Remember the starving African babies”. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? I was 45 before we had the internet. My go-to before that was women’s magazines, though I did buy a book that explained quite well about hysterectomies and what to expect afterwards. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I was a late developer. Fifteen for boobs and periods. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? This sounds like a generalisation, but I believe that such rituals are more likely to be dependent on your parent’s level of education and disposable income. Generally, people go with what they know and just get on with it. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Probably concerned that any pocket money I received would now have to be spent on sanitary products, and annoyed that these were subject to VAT. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I probably do less exercise now than previously, though I am conscious of the need to keep moving. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). Definitely the internet. And some TV programmes specifically about issues of health and wellbeing (but not ‘dieting’). Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I am more aware of my body now because Covid has made me re-evaluate. Health has suddenly become such a fragile thing, I’d forgotten that my childhood illnesses – measles, chicken pox, German measles, mumps – were killers. Covid has, for my generation and older, been our wake-up call. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the generations who came after who don’t understand, or wilfully deny, the dangers coronaviruses pose. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? It depends what changes occur in my own health. Generally, I will try to move more and eat less. Both my husband and I have recently been told we have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to try the Mediterranean diet. We’ll see how that goes. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? I’m probably the same as most people, if I see someone looking unkempt or maybe a bit smelly, I might think either they are just lazy about their personal hygiene. Then again, depression can do that to some people. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Not as such. The issue I’ve found is that other people want you to look a certain way. When I was younger and went to the hairdresser, the choice was a ‘Purdie’ (short bob) or a ‘Farrah Flick (long hair layered at the front), then later – for short hair – it was mousses and gels (for spikes). The same with clothes. I bought what was available, and fitted. Though I avoided the 80s bubble and ra-ra skirts, I did wear platform shoes and I did have huge shoulder pads. The only way to have something ‘classic’ to wear was to make it yourself. It is true what they say about fashion – if you wait long enough, it will all come round again. Female, 64. Married. Lives in North-East Wales. Writer (and Open University Masters Student 2020-2022). Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Not at all. They grew up in WW2 and with rationing. They made do and mended. Couldn’t afford to do anything else. My father would have been ridiculed on the factory floor for wearing winkle-pickers and drainpipe trousers, let alone a velvet jacket. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? My Desert Island item would be a never-ending supply of eco-friendly shampoo bars (and a sneaky pair of tweezers). Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? No, to both questions. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Shower, dress, dry hair, go out. No change now, other than I no longer work, and socialising is on hold."

The word health has multitude of meanings, that we have a National Health Service suggests it is a common good to be nurtured for the benefit of the nation. Indeed a common plea during COVID 19 has been to stay safe from the virus to protect the NHS. On a personal level health represents being able to go about my everyday life without impediment and to do the things I want to do. If I feel unhealthy I will stay at home and nurture my body such that I can resume normal like. Wellbeing relates to the way I think and feel about things; it is not physical but my sense of wellbeing can be curtailed by physical ailments, dull and grey weather, feelings of lack of self worth and loneliness. Healthy Body: clear skin, height weight balance, ability to exercise, clean mouth, odour free Identity I am a white, well educated female who was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 1998, and high blood pressure in 2000. I now take drugs to manage both of these conditions and receive regular check ups with an oncologist and my GP. As a child of the Welfare State I have grown up to expect access to such expertise in the same way as people access education as a right. However I am aware that because of my education and an awareness of the need to seek help at appropriate times. My access to such services is distorted by where I live and my gender. I also have private medical cover as part of my pension such that I do not have to wait to see a consultant or if the need arises certain medical treatments. I am thus privileged. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Such distinctions were background noise at school….my only activities were swimming and walking. Ball games and I were never good bedfellows and team sports were only watched alongside supporting current boyfriends. Part of the background noise was that the players were healthy, clean mind, clean body syndrome. The compulsion to engage with sport disappeared at University and beyond except as a spectator. I continued to swim think it was good exercise and it would keep me healthy. It was difficult to associate this with wellbeing though I admit to feeling virtuous when I completed sponsored swims for The British Heart Foundation. L7591 I seriously began to unpack what these two terms meant when I started teaching the Sociology of Health and Medicine and enjoyed exploring these ideas with sixth form student s and undergraduates. Variations in experience based on gender, ethnicity and social class became very obvious as did access to health and wellbeing support. I began to associate wellbeing as to about feelings but also recognized that there was an impact of health. The intellectual division of psycho and soma seemed less clear in a valuable way. I learnt much more about health and well being by exploring it with adults than I ever has as a child or an adolescent. I had taken bodily changes for granted, I really have very little remembrance of my puberty but was much more aware of that of my daughters and no my grandchildren. There was a strong silence around bodily matters in my parental family. Growing Older. Until very recently I was a regular swimmer and I continue to walk with relative ease (not much good at inclines). I suspect vanity plays a large part on the need I feel to exercise. I am now much more aware of the interaction between health and wellbeing and this is regularly informed through my volunteering. I have learnt a great deal about the need for oral health and of the implications of not attending to this.  One of the hardest things about the two lockdowns we have experienced during lock down is not being able to go to concerts. I greatly missed The Proms this summer; listening at home is not the same as live music. This also deprived me of human contact and for the first time since I was widowed I experienced an at time frightening sense of loneliness. The ability to form a bubble has in part alleviated this anxiety but with the current tier restrictions a different degree of loneliness has crept in. My wellbeing is being compromised but my health is safer if I accept the constraints I am being asked to undertake for the nations health. Health, wellbeing and appearance. The fashion industry is a clear driver in this relationship and in conjunction with a gym/exercise culture a range of body types emerge as ideals. I do acknowledge tospendingtime thinking about whatI wear togo “out”.There have beendays during this pandemic when I have dressed up to feel better. I was very conscious of the unruliness of my hair at times and greatly relieved when I could have a haircut. A luxury of old age and a good pension is that I can afford to buy clothes I feel good in and here is a link between wellbeing and appearance. The feedback from others about appearance reinforces a sense of well being which is different from being vain. Parental Influences. My parents experienced growing upinthe Great Depression of the 1920’s and 30’s. This colouredtheir sense of selfworth and engendered attitudesof carewith money, make do and mend; they always saved and made few frivolous outings or L7591 purchases. The investment that they made in me was my education and my health. I benefited from the development of the NHS, visits to the dentist were regular, medical checks routine and expected. They also had almost total respect for health professionals and these people were key to their sense of well being when their health was being looked after. They were always carefully dressed in and out of the home."

My health has been influenced by my gender because of all the particular problems a woman has to deal with.  I suffer now because of the harm done to my body by the births of three large babies. As a child my parents were responsible for my health.  I remember my father taking me to a particular dentist and to an optician.  After my father died my mother became responsible. Looking back, I realise that it was because she did not want a little girl with a patch on her glasses that my eyes became neglected with consequent problems in later life. I was aware that I had health problems with my ears being a real problem.  For years I had to be very careful not to get water in them so swimming a problem. I had my tonsils removed and adenoids twice. I had sinus problems. In my teens my appendix was removed in an emergency operation. This made me realise that my body was a problem. Friends seemed to be OK. I started developing bad headaches and later migraines. As far as I remember nobody talked to me about well-being. I was very anxious about the whole idea of periods and tried to keep them secret. I have done yoga on and off, joined a gym for a time.  I loathed games and gym at school and only at drama school learnt to enjoy movement classes.  I do not enjoy exercise for its own sake, but I do walk a lot, or did when possible.  I try to keep up with a few exercises for my arthritis and in preparation for a hip op if I ever get on the waiting list, but I get very bored with exercises.  I am a vegetarian and try to eat healthily although during lock-down I’ve consumed large amounts of comfort eating, cakes and biscuits.  I take extra vitamins and minerals. I am now doing a brief meditation and Tai Chi session every day. I do think health relates to external appearance to certain extent, but I have never been influenced by popular ideas. No products I couldn’t live without.  Routines?  So long since I went anywhere. I keep clean, brush my hair…..That’s about it. This is brief because at the moment the subject bores me. Sorry."

Wellbeing – More concerned with the emotional and psychological feelings and being happy and content so you can live life with purpose and meaning. A healthy body – age/ physical/ mental/ emotional/ functioning An image that comes to mind might be of an athlete/sport person In terms of health and wellbeing, I feel that my gender has brought me the opportunity of having two daughters, and thus going through the obstetric and post-natal experiences of the healthcare services and being aware that my own health and well-being would directly impact on the health of the babies. I realise that maybe my social class has had an impact on my experiences. I had a good education and so am able to use knowledge I learnt if I need to question anything about my health. My education and upbringing also encouraged good communication skills, so I am able to communicate efficiently about my own health concerns, am able to widely research about health to seek out the correct advice and can ask questions of medical professionals in a specific and detailed way. I cannot think of any experiences that may have been influenced by my sexual orientation, and in connection with my ethnicity, my white British background does not make me prone to any specific diseases or conditions, as for example certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to sickle cell anemia. It is difficult to pinpoint where and when I first became aware of health, or wellbeing, but I assume as a child, learning from my parents and family around me, either through direct information or being aware of illnesses of relatives etc. I lived with both parents and they would have had responsibility for my health and wellbeing, probably more focusing on my mum as she did not work so would be the parent who took me for doctor’s appointments, give me vitamin tablets etc. I don’t remember them talking to me specifically about health, but I assume this probably happened generally all the way through childhood and it doesn’t stand out for me as a distinct memory. School health education that I can remember involved a hearing test with a community nurse at primary school, after which we were encouraged to tell a parent or a teacher if we ever thought we couldn’t hear properly. Similarly, school sight tests were also a point where we were told to make it known if we had trouble reading books or seeing the blackboard. Sex education lessons came at secondary school, and I seem to recollect the focus being far more about the physical and practical side of sex education and far less about relationships and self-care. W4376 Secondary school meant I had specific lessons in cookery, and sometimes these would look at nutrition, what to cook for a balanced diet, and the consequences of eating a poorly proportioned diet. I did read teenage magazines which often had articles or quizzes about hair care, skin care, fitness and exercise, and I would also imagine that conversations with friends would involve discussions about health, yet I don’t remember them ever focusing on mental health issues and were primarily about physical health. As an adolescent and knowing about menstruation and periods from a conversation with my mum, I remember the day I woke up and realised I had my first period. I stayed in bed, not wanting to get up, and when my mum came in to see what was happening, I remember crying. This might have been down to the shock of this finally happening after quite a while of knowing about periods, or maybe out of embarrassment and not being sure what I needed to do when I got up. Either way, she reassured me, sorted me out, and it then just became part and parcel of life. As I have grown older, I try and pay attention to diet, activity, maintaining a strong mental resolve and keeping everything balanced and proportionate to what is going on in life around me. I learn information about health and wellbeing from radio programmes, podcasts, news articles and talking to friends of varying ages about their experiences. I would say I am more aware of my body as I get older, both from the sheer fact of aging or as of now, because I am hopefully at the final stages of being peri-menopausal and has this has brought about the greatest changes in my body I am aware of. I understand the side-effects that make me feel different to how I might have done twenty years ago and feel lucky that they do not cause too much disruption to my life but are both physical and mental changes that I think you only can truly understand when it affects you. I would hope that my attitude and approach to my health and wellbeing stays the same in future years – actively aware but not obsessive. I am aware that for many people, how they perceive their external appearance impacts on how they feel about their inner selves. Poor physical and mental health can arise from concern, or low self-esteem over appearances. I know I feel better about myself when my hair is brushed and tidy, but if it is not, I do not suffer because of this. I have never been influenced by other peoples ideals of beauty and physical appearance, believing that I am who I am and am confident with myself. The internet and social media are blamed for putting pressure on people to conform to expectations of beauty and while I don’t think my daughters did/do now have problems with this, I would hope that their children never become trapped by the pressures of how society around you expects you to look. My parents were not influenced like this and at the age of 80 now, probably also see the advent of the internet as being a worrying factor for peer pressure about looks. There are not really any health or beauty products I could not live without but if castaway on a Desert Island, I would prefer to have moisturizer, toothpaste and sun cream. When I was little, I remember my dad getting ready to go to work, always shaving in the morning with a face full of lathered up soap and using a blade razor, and it always looked to me a very careful, delicate job which I loved to watch. And for him, going out for the evening would involve just one extra thing; a splash of aftershave which in the early days was always Old Spice, a smell I can still conjure up now. W4376 My mum didn’t work but would still wear make-up every day, and the main memory I have of that time is that block mascara was easier to get on to the brush and apply with the application of a little bit of spit. It seemed normal to me at the time, and then as make-up developed and mascara sticks and wands took over, spitting on the block mascara then seemed a strange thing to have done. I have read in articles and heard on radio discussions just how many women thought it was only their mother that did this, for us suddenly to realise this was what most women did. I remember a Radio 4 ‘Women’s Hour’ discussion on the progression of cosmetics when the penny dropped, and I think a little of the magic of my mum putting on her make-up disappeared for me at that point. When going out for the evening, I can visualize her filing and painting her fingernails, waving her hands and blowing on her fingers to try and get the nail polish to set quicker. This always seemed so glamourous as she would not wear nail polish during the week so signified an evening out or something special. My routine does not really change whether going out to work or socialising and has never done in the past. General skincare each day involves washing with warm water and never soap, toning with alcohol free toner and then moisturizing. Make up is a light touch of foundation, translucent powder over that and then a light coat of brown/black mascara on my eyelashes, small touch of blusher and lipstick. Always the same look, I don’t have the inclination to spend extra time and energy on different looks. My take is that provided I look clean, presentable and my make-up is neatly applied, I want people to like me and take an interest in me for who I am, not what I look like. My routine did change once on my wedding day when I was persuaded to wear some eyeshadow, eyeliner and a slightly different shade of lipstick. I gave in a little way but was still insistent I wanted my husband-to-be to see the same person he knew when I got to the top of the aisle in the church, not a woman who looked completely different. The most recent change in my routine has been since the first Covid lockdown in mid-March 2020 when I decided if I were going nowhere and seeing no-one, I would not bother with make-up and apart from a treat on Christmas Day where my family made the effort of dressing smartly for Zoom catchups, I have not worn make-up since. I feel that on my once weekly trip to the supermarket, the gap between my fringe and the top of my mask is so small, no-one would appreciate the make-up and I am more than happy for the natural look for now and may continue this once the pandemic is over for the routine days when nothing special is planned."

My husband and I both developed ‘symptoms’ of COVID in April, but were not sick enough to be tested or to require hospitalisation. On the Friday he came home from shopping for his parents-in-law in their local Sainsburys (not our usual Sainsburys) and said he thought he’d got COVID, as he was experiencing a tight chest which had suddenly come on as he left the shop, and he also had slight breathing difficulties. In line with his usual practice when ill, he went straight to bed. I took his temperature, and it was slightly up. On the Saturday morning he said his chest was better but he’d found it more difficult than usual to breathe during the night (he usually finds it harder to breathe at night because he is overweight). However, that was the worst of it – by the Sunday morning everything had returned to normal except his temperature, though he felt very tired. On the Monday he got up and worked for four hours, then returned to rest, and did the same on the Tuesday, and was able to work normally on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Two days after that, on Easter Sunday, I awoke in the early morning feeling ice-cold and I could not warm myself up. By mid-morning I was experiencing such fatigue and weakness that I couldn’t even sit up in bed, and had to watch the Zoomed church service lying down. My temperature, which is usually below normal, started to rise, and I had a headache. I couldn’t do anything other than stay in bed for the next ten days – besides the intense fatigue I also had severe muscle pains, particularly in and around the site on the left side of my chest where I had had a lump- and lymphectomy 15 years ago. (Although no cancer was found in my lymph glands, the whole set on my left was removed, and since then whenever my immune system has been fighting an infection I have experienced pain and swelling in my left arm, as the lymph fluid builds up.) These pains were the worst part of this particular sickness. Once I was able to get up again it was a further two weeks before I could manage to stay up for a whole day, and even after that I would need to spend a day in bed recovering once or twice a week for some time. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. When lockdown started I had already been in therapy for a resistant depression which had been my normal state for the past 30 years; other treatments had failed so I had self-referred to a private hospital and begun this intensive course of treatment, which was just beginning to work by the time lockdown began. I have continued my regular therapy sessions with my psychologist throughout lockdown, although they now take place remotely rather than in the hospital. This has worked very well for me, saving a very early start once a week and a lengthy journey to and from the hospital. I have also had consultations with the psychiatrist who is overseeing my treatment, again remotely using video conferencing technology. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Lockdown has been a tremendously useful period for me because it has removed many of the day to day stresses which were perpetuating the depression – physical stresses and social stresses, plus the sheer exhaustion of having to keep going. It was as if I’d been struggling to keep up with life for years and suddenly it stopped to let me catch up. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Initially my emotions were no more unstable than before lockdown, but as I began to relax properly for the first time in years I noticed that they were more stable and on a handful of occasions I have experienced very clear positive feelings such as hope. I hadn’t been able to feel anything positive for years before this. As the end of lockdown nears, however, I am noticing less stability. Sometimes I feel restless, at other times I feel very sad at the thought that this time of peace and rest is coming to an end, and I feel scared and stressed and burdened by the weight of obligations and expectations that seem about to descend upon me again. I am deeply angry that things seem to be returning to ‘normal’, and I desperately want to avoid my life returning to ‘the old normal’, because for me that was horrible. I feel as if I was just getting sorted and now it’s all about to be ripped away from me and the noise and chaos are about to engulf me again. I realise, however, that my experience is pretty much unique and for most people this has been a time of fear and loss and grief. We are comfortably off, and although our jobs are both uncertain at the moment we are in no immediate danger of long-term unemployment. Similarly, to date we have not lost anyone close to us to COVID19, indeed amongst our family and friends we hardly know anyone who is even sure they have had the virus. So we really have enjoyed very pleasant circumstances and this has obviously coloured our emotional reactions. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Introduction of lockdown – too little, too late, but glad when it finally happened. Easing of lockdown – too much, too soon, driven in part by populism. Deaths in care homes – despicable neglect, blatant ageism, chilling. Defence of Dominic Cummings – shameful. Attempt to get children back in school in June – not thought through at all. There has been an increasing reluctance to listen to the advice of the chief scientists, for which I expect the entire country to pay in terms of ongoing risks to health. However, Furlough scheme – surprisingly generous. I have now given up thinking about or engaging with political news, as I find it only upsets me and there’s nothing I can do about it. I did not vote this government in and they have not won me over by their handling of the crisis. Having said that, I doubt the Opposition, with its (then) inexperienced and autocratic leader, would have done much better – they might have made different mistakes, but they would still have been mistakes. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I really do not want to think about this. It is too distressing. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Radio 4. BBC news online. We do not have a television and we do not take a newspaper. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. We do not have a television, and if we did I would not have watched them. There are many more positive and beneficial things I can do with my time. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? No. There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? It would certainly be more inclusive, and I would welcome it on behalf of my friends who have televisions but rely on BSL. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Both my jobs initially moved to ‘working from home’. However, there were only so many ‘back office’ jobs I could do remotely for the library, as most of my role is to do with interacting with customers, so once my colleagues and I had exhausted all the jobs we could do remotely we were furloughed. My other job is office-based and I was already working from home on occasion so it has been easy to adapt and I have continued to work through the whole lockdown period. I have found working from home more efficient than working at my places of work, because home is a quiet environment and I do not have to cope with the multiple distractions of an open-plan office. However, that has meant that although I have been productive, I have also found it more tiring as I have achieved more with fewer breaks. Being on furlough has been a real blessing, freeing me to get much-needed rest and focus on my mental health. I have also appreciated not having to commute to either job. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Lockdown has been very positive for me and my husband. We have no children so have not had to worry about home schooling, or (more recently) when we feel it’s safe to let them go back to school. Similarly, we haven’t really had to worry about caring for elderly or vulnerable dependents. My parents-in-law are elderly and somewhat vulnerable, but they live about 17 miles away. They’ve been able and keen to shop for themselves (it’s the one time each week when they leave their housing estate) so we’ve only actually started seeing them again as restrictions have loosened – fortunately around the time of their birthdays, so we have met in their garden and kept 2m apart. My husband and I have enjoyed spending more time around the house and more time together. The only real adaptations we’ve had to make are around working practices: as soon as he started working from home my husband took over my study as his computer laboratory, while continuing to use his own study for church business (processing the finances etc.). This meant that I have nowhere to work when working from home, so he generously spent some of his profits on a corner desk for our bedroom, which has become my new work area. I’m very contented with this, as it’s a very nice piece of furniture, and our room is my favourite room in the house, being cool and light and comfortable. We’ve also had to make an effort to synchronise our breaks and mealtimes, as we were starting to drift out of sync and never really sit down together, despite living in the same house. My husband likes to listen to the news on the radio at mealtimes, so we have come to an arrangement whereby I set my alarm for 1245 and 1745 Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist each day and we get to the kitchen as soon as we can after that, with the aim of sitting down to eat together by the time of the weather forecast (shortly before the hour, at which time the news is read). Similarly, if one of us decides to take a break the other will usually stop what they’re doing and join in. This was initially hard for me, as I’m used to my breaks being at set times and for a maximum of 15 minutes, but I’ve learnt to be more flexible when working from home. We have both enjoyed being able to spend more time with our dog and our cat, and I have made an effort to teach our (rather elderly) dog some simple games and give her special times of petting. Our cat joined the family about a month before the lockdown, so it has been very good to spend so much time around the house bonding with her, and she is now a very friendly cat who actively seeks me out and demonstrates her affection for me. This is very rewarding! We have several vulnerable friends who have been shielding, so we have made an effort to phone them once or twice a week or more (as with my in-laws). Our friendships have thus become slightly more intentional as we would usually see these friends in the normal course of the week and now we have to make the effort to remember them and set aside time for longer telephone conversations, but the relationships haven’t changed all that much. Some friendships have perforce been put on hold – in all but one case this has come as a relief to me, as it is one less source of stress and frustration and worry – and I am looking for new ways to manage the number of demanding friends I have, and to be more selective in future choices of friends when lockdown lifts. I have kept in touch with a few special friends through emails and/or Facebook Messenger, and I have developed one new friendship (with someone I knew of but had never really talked to) and rekindled two old ones – the latter as a result of reading their posts on Facebook and realising they were in need of encouragement and/or support. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience of this? Before lockdown I was already au fait with IT communications, so emailing and Skyping were no problem. I soon added Zoom to my repertoire, as most of the meetings I needed to attend were using Zoom rather than Skype. It was surprisingly easy to adapt to having my psychology/therapy sessions using online facilities – in fact it has suited me rather better than going to the hospital for them, as it has dispensed with the 2-hour round trip this used to involve. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? The job from which I have been furloughed uses MS Teams to keep working (senior) and furloughed (junior) members in touch with each other. Initially this worked well, but as the terms of our furlough mean that we must not respond to emails coming into the account which is linked to MS Teams the incentive to log on simply to check Teams has decreased and those of us not currently working hardly ever seem to post on it. I haven’t used Zoom or any other e-conferencing software to keep in touch with friends individually – I think most of my friends are more comfortable with written communications than ‘live’ online ones. We offered my parents-in-law help setting up What’s App so that we could all see each other and spend time together, but they refused; my mother-in-law prefers telephone, text and email communications and my father-in-law distrusts/can’t be bothered with computers and will rarely spend time on the phone due to difficulties with his hearing. Both of them immensely prefer ‘in person’ visits and are prepared to wait for them to become possible and regular again. I have kept in touch with a few special friends through emails and/or Facebook Messenger. I have developed one new friendship (with someone I knew of but had never really talked to) and rekindled two old ones – all three as the result of reading their Facebook posts. One was offering support and two were in need of support at the time. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have occasionally used Facebook to escape from current events, but it is hard to avoid posts referring to them, and I find Facebook quite stressful anyway; it feels as if I’m being bombarded by (mostly useless) information delivered too loudly. Having said that, I am very aware that when I feel frustrated I spend too much time aimlessly scrolling through Facebook, and this is neither a feel-good activity, nor a productive one. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? For most of lockdown I haven’t been further than our local Spar, where I’ve been pleased to find some things that were unavailable in the main supermarkets. The first time I went to Waitrose again I lost the plot and instead of buying lots of sensible everyday food I hoovered up lots and lots of the reduced-price chocolate left over from Easter. I really felt quite dizzy with the freedom of being able to go to a big supermarket again and the amount and variety of choice available for each product type was mind-boggling! My husband has done the regular supermarket shopping, and instead of visiting various different supermarkets, has stuck to Sainsburys, and used our local one every time. Normally I would visit Tesco when I was in town for work, and we would go to our local Sainsburys whenever we needed a big shop. On average he has made 1-2 visits to Sainsburys each week. At the start of lockdown we decided not to stockpile, as we felt it was selfish and should be unnecessary if the supply chains continued to operate as they should. However, on my last afternoon in work he came to pick me up and visited a Chinese supermarket on the way home, where he bought 3 trade-size boxes of noodles. He has eaten a packet most days since then, and there are still plenty left. (Originally these were for use in emergencies, but we soon realised that there were way more noodles than there could possibly be emergencies!) Similarly, on that day I visited a delicatessen near work and bought six small bars of my favourite chocolate. That was as near as we came to stockpiling as such, though we did try to keep two of every ‘staple’ in our cupboard whenever possible, and aimed to have enough food in the house at any given moment to be able to sustain us for 7-10 days, in case both of us had COVID so neither could shop for a week or more. We experienced the same difficulties as other people in our area – first, the shortage of toilet paper (we had just bought a 4 pack before lockdown and fortunately this lasted us through the shortage), then eggs (we thought we’d manage to avoid this as we already had regular deliveries of local free range eggs from the milkman, but there was a handful of mornings when we received a note saying he couldn’t get any, and a couple of days when we had normal, rather than free range, eggs), then flour (as other people also caught the home cooking bug) and refried beans (great to keep in the cupboard and very good for diets) and, finally, Quorn products (presumably new converts to vegetarianism/veganism were catching on to the good stuff by then). We didn’t manage to get any hand sanitiser for the first few weeks of lockdown, but my parents-in-law, who live 17 miles from us, found their local shops got supplies before ours did, so provided us with our first two bottles. Our local Spar had hand sanitiser and facemasks long before any of the large supermarkets in our area did. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist A year before the lockdown I reached my target weight with Slimming World, and I maintained this successfully by continuing to follow their ‘food combining’ guidance for at least two meals out of three each day. The restrictions of lockdown have made this more of a challenge, but I have succeeded by dint of restricting my choice of meals down to a few tried and trusted staples, for which ingredients are relatively easy to get hold of locally, each of which I have once or twice a week, where before lockdown I would experiment more with Slimming World ready-meals and/or recipes. I have continued to have salad with lunch and supper each day, and to snack mainly on fresh fruit. This has meant that we have had to shop a little more often than we would have liked to during lockdown, but it has meant that we are eating a high quantity of fresh fruit and vegetables. Before lockdown we ate out on average once a week, and treated ourselves to Marks & Spencer calorie-counted ready meals about once a week. During lockdown we have completely stopped eating out, and have only made occasional trips to Marks & Spencers for ready meals (and other treats). One of the few things I have actively missed during lockdown has been going to coffee shops for coffee and (sometimes) a chat with friends. This was my regular treat while I was travelling to work, and for obvious reasons has now stopped. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? I started off really well with exercise in lockdown, given that I hadn’t done any since breaking my ankle 18 months earlier, although as a non-driver and a dog-owner it was normal for me to walk on average about 2 miles each day. Having heard that physical fitness could increase the chances of surviving Coronavirus I decided to start exercising again, and removed the clothes from our cross-trainer, which had been doubling as a wardrobe since the last time we had an indoor exercise fad. I found I could just about manage 5 minutes on it, and my first target was to be able to complete 10 minutes without a break. I achieved this after about a fortnight of exercise sessions every other day, and was moving towards 15 minutes non-stop when I went down with ‘symptoms of Coronavirus’. As I had a fairly straightforward, if long, recovery process I’m inclined to think that my gentle start at getting fit did help, but since then I’ve got out of the habit, and my only exercise is our daily walk with our elderly dog, who can only manage to keep going for 20-30 minutes at a gentle pace. I think some of the problem is the residual lethargy and feeling of nausea which I haven’t completely shaken off since being ill, but I’m also finding it hard to motivate myself at present, and easy to make excuses and find things I’d rather be doing! If exercise hasn’t kept me occupied, what has? As soon as I heard that the church at which I am Organist was moving to online-only services which would focus more on contemporary worship music than hymns I made the decision not to take a sabbatical from playing the organ, but rather to use the time for learning new repertoire that I would enjoy. There are two pieces of the usual repertoire of a wedding organist that I haven’t yet had the opportunity to learn, so I have started on the easier of the two, ‘The Entry of the Queen of Sheba’ from Handel’s oratorio ‘Solomon’. This is being quite time-consuming, as I’ve been unable to find a version I like either in hard copy or online so I’ve had to create my own arrangement (basically a mash-up of several other versions, none of which was exactly what I wanted) as well as learning the actual dots on the page. I’ve nearly got the arrangement completed, and have learned the notes of all the sections apart from the ones I’m still arranging. Once the arrangement is finished and I’ve got all the notes under my fingers I’ll still have to increase the speed and work on interpretation, so there’s plenty to keep me busy yet. In terms of new skills, need has forced me to become familiar with using Zoom, and various video recording and editing software. I’ve also started an online course in Jazz Piano offered (free) by FutureLearn, though this is a fairly recent development and I doubt I’ll persist beyond the first module. Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? I’m not into DIY at the best of times, and lockdown hasn’t changed that for me. However, my husband got quite into doing things around the house in the early weeks of the lockdown, and completed a number of the niggly little jobs that he didn’t have time for when he had to travel to work. As well as clearing out and Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist cleaning his study he has given away a spare computer desk, brought the wifi into our bedroom, mended the front door bell and rehung the airing rack in the sun room. We’ve looked at some of the bigger jobs that we’ll need to get people in to do for us – tarmacking the front yard and driveway, repainting the front door and window frames and re-roofing the sun room – but as yet we haven’t decided which is the top priority (they’ve all been urgent for a while now!) and, as neither of our main jobs is as secure as they were we don’t want to commit to the expense at the moment either, so project House Improvement has stalled for now. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We have been watching old episodes of ‘Dad’s Army’ (on the computer), which I am finding very comforting in this uncertain and anxious time. It does me good to see something as terrible as the 2nd World War treated with gentle humour, and I feel encouraged by the mix of the everyday trivia and the raw courage exhibited by the hapless volunteers. I also enjoy the period detail of the sets. We are currently watching the televised version of ‘Wolf Hall’, again through the computer. A friend has introduced me to the NY Metropolitan Opera nightly streaming and on-demand services lately, and so far I have seen ‘The Marriage of Figaro’ (Mozart), Akhnaten (Glass) and Satyagraha (Glass) through this medium – operas I would never be able to afford either the time or the tickets to go and see ‘live’. I am hoping to watch ‘Wozzek’ (Berg) this week. I have enjoyed re-reading some old favourites – especially the Daisy Dalrymple mysteries by Carola Dunn (mainly through Audible audiobooks) and the four books of E.M. Delafield’s ‘Diary of a Provincial Lady’. I have also read some books for the first time, including the entire ‘Wolf Hall’ series by Hilary Mantel, the entire series (to date) of Lord James Hamilton mysteries by Lynn Florkievicz (through Kindle) and three books that I was given (at my request) for Christmas: ‘Why do Shepherds need a Bush?’ (David Hilliam), ‘Sussex, Kent and Surrey 1939’ (Richard Wyndham), and ‘Lost England, 1870-1930’ (Philip Davies). The last of these has become my ‘go to’ feel-good book, mainly because its splendidly atmospheric reproductions of old photographs make me imagine what it was like living in a different time and place. In order to sustain my spiritual life I have continued reading part of the Bible most days, and have enjoyed reading ‘Every Job a Parable’ (John van Sloten) and ‘The Introvert Charismatic’ (Mark Tanner). I have also taken out a trial subscription to ‘The Church Times’, as I find the articles bring an element of challenge and growth to my devotional life. I have used the mobile phone app ‘The Bible’ to follow several series of Bible studies by various (mainly American) authors, and I have also benefited greatly from watching the daily podcast by Bishop Andrew Rumsey, ‘Going to Ground’, which (sadly) has just finished, having reached 100 episodes. Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Before lockdown I would have a very hot bath every night, but since lockdown began I have noticed that I am bathing much less frequently, and showering roughly every other day. Personal cleanliness was, and still is, very important to me, and I have wondered why my habits have changed. I think it’s partly a seasonal thing – during the hot weather in the spring the idea of a hot bath wasn’t so appealing – and partly to do with my lack of stress now I don’t go out to work: a very hot bath was part of my de-stressing night-time ritual when I was commuting to and from work, but now I don’t feel in need of this comforting evening habit as I am much less stressed at the end of most days. I still wash my hair once or twice a week, as I did before, but obviously I haven’t been able to get it cut since early March. This hasn’t been too much of a problem, as I was planning to grow it down from a short bob, and I have been able to cut my fringe myself with reasonable success (for a first time!). Spring 2020 Directive Part 2: COVID 19 UPDATE MO C7425 Female, Age 53, Married, Chester, Music Librarian/Organist Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? I have experienced some difficulties sleeping, but no more than I would have normally, as the regime of anti-depressants I was prescribed long before lockdown has side effects which include disturbed sleep. I have dealt with these difficulties as I usually do, by listening to talking books or getting up and doing puzzles until I feel sleepy. Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I have had no COVID related dreams, so far as I can remember, but I have had quite vivid nightmares set in my school or university days, in which people in authority (teachers, bosses from previous jobs, baddies from films I have watched) are chasing me with the intention of harming me in some way – usually raping or killing me, or both. I have been in desperate flight when I have woken up. Sometimes I have cried out in my sleep and my husband has had to wake me and reassure me."

I had to drive to the urgent treatment centre in the nearest hospital in order to have it extracted. The ‘operation’ took aminute and I waited onlyfive minutes. But it was alittle unnerving tomix with people for the first time for weeks even though there were relatively few day patients around. My underlying conditions – low level diabetes, risk of heart atrial fibrillation, tendency to high blood pressure and mild COPD are largely managed with medication. During the crisis, however, I have been told by my GP practice not to attend the surgery for routine appointments or monitoring tests which have been placed on hold until the lockdown ends. My one current problem is the sudden deterioration in my hearing which makes conversation and, especially, using the phone all the more difficult – and increases the sense of isolation. Just before the lockdown, I planned appointments to have this seen to but now I have to wait until normality returns. My emotions vary. Being almost totally isolated, as instructed by the NHS, due to age and underlying medical conditions, does, inevitably, induce feelings of loneliness and anxiety and sometimes lethargy. Most of the time I manage to cope by keeping busy or diverted and keeping in touch with family and friends by email and text etc. My emotions are, though, still affected by grief over the death of my wife of 50 years about three years ago. The sense of her absence makes isolation all the harder to live with. If we were still together, we would have found isolation much easier, even though we might have worried about each other, other people and the state of the world. We could have found enjoyment in doing things together and just securityin each other’s presence. Enjoyment and joy – very much in short supply these days. Increasing age doesn’t help either. I suppose this all amounts to a mild form of depression but at least I know why that is – it is not an inherent condition. And it helps a little to know that I am isolating to keep myself as safe as possible and to help protect others. Iamdoing ‘my bit’. I was made doubly aware recently of the seriousness of Covid-19 and the danger it poses when for some reason (possibly stress caused by technology) I suddenly felt hot and feared for a moment thought it could be the virus. Thankfully, when I checked mytemperature with aforehead thermometer, Ilearned that it was normal. Maybeit was nature’s way of reminding me to stay indoors. The Government It seems strange how a small news report about a virus outbreak in one part of a large country thousands of miles away (in January I think) has suddenly taken over and threatened and disrupted our lives. It seems that is often the unexpected dangers, the ones from the blind side, that cause the most harm. Certainly, the government didn’t see this one coming. During the early period when the virus began to spread, the government was still obsessed with leaving the European Community (‘Getting Brexit done’) and were late in the dayin taking action. The crisis has brought brough problems which would be almost insurmountable for any government but the present Tory administration could have done and could still do much better. We have not been well served, compared with other countries like Germany and South Korea. It is difficult to know where to start. I suppose with the fact that a wiser prime minister than a narcissist who thought that it was enough to sound like Churchill, instead of acting like him, would have chosen a more talented and less subservient cabinet. A better government would have coordinated public information more tightly so that the vital information it gave out was more consistent and less confusing. And an over reliance on saying that they are led by the science brushes over the fact that, as is necessary, scientists do not always agree with each other. Praising the NHS every five minutes is no substitute for acting effectively and in a timely fashion and presenting care workers with a badge is insulting when they are among those most at risk and up to now the least protected. Other concerns are: . A contingency planning exercise in 2017 seems to have largely been ignored which has prevented adequate stockpiling of medical supplies and personal protection. . The plight of residents and staff in care homes, especially vulnerable, has been virtually ignored until recently resulting in a high death rate which could have been prevented. . Anearlybeliefin the theoryof ‘herd immunity’ (allowing less vulnerable people to be infected and to mix so that they helped spread immunity) delayed the onset of social distancing measures, lagging behind other countries. . An inability to initiate testing for the virus early enough. . Confusion and inconsistency in the selection of ‘vulnerable’ people for ‘shielded’ isolation (as I am when I know older people than me with more serious conditions have not been selected) . The earlier cuts to health and social care funding of previous Tory administrations. As a result, the UK has recorded the highest total death rate in Europe (as I write we have just topped 30,000) and almost in the world. And, the UK economy and all local communities will suffer all the more damage. I think the government has now realised what is at stake and is probably acting in a more coherent and cautious manner. They have to find a way to balance managing the social distancing policy with the desperate need to re-start the economy. Relaxing the former too soon could risk the spread of the virus starting up again, forcing a second lockdown. But delaying economic regeneration too long could do even greater damage to the long term economic and social fabric of the country than it has already done. And if course, continue to increase the huge cost of supporting business and workers and the enormous public financial debt. It will not have helped to have left the European Community, of course – international cooperation has never been more needed. Now the government has their eye on the ball at last, I think (or maybe hope) that they will manage to restore normality gradually, using sound information and advice. News I read The Guardian daily – as I have done for 60 years and often monitor the news on the various news websites on my i-phone. In addition, I watch BBC News bulletins and their news channel almost obsessively. It is depressing but not so depressing and anger inducing as the daily TV news briefings on BBC TV which do little but to demonstrate the inadequacies of a singularly weak set of cabinet ministers. Most of what is said by government representatives is little more than cliché and waffle, learned by rote almost. The useful element is usually the contribution of scientific and medical advisors and their visual aids. I know no-one who has trouble accessing the news but many who don’t watch the news because they feel it is too depressing. Having hearing impairment, I always use the subtitles and I find that adequate. I am not sure if signing is also essential but have an open mind. Work and Home Life Being long retired I don’t, of course, work but before the lockdown I spent a good deal of time as a volunteer: as a befriender to vulnerable people and as a trustee and secretary of a small charity. The befriending is suspended. I am still doing a little work for the charity with writing and editing policy documents and promotional literature and will be joining meetings via video conferencing (Zoom). Much of the work and information is conveyed by email. Home life has changed a good deal in that all life is confined to the home: no visits to friends and family, no outside walks, reliance for exercise on an exercise bike, no pub visits (though those were infrequent anyway), more watching TV, a little more reading. My world has shrunk. One significant change has been the evolution of a strict daily routine to get me through the day, based on meals, writing, emailing people, exercise and treats (tea and biscuits, coffee, wine). One problem which I know is common to a lot of people in isolation, is not knowing what day it is. To solve that I have just bought a digital clock which displays time, date, and day. Technology Before the lockdown, I was already using a variety of online technology: email, text, WhatsApp, and Instagram (the latter only for sharing photos with family members). I do not (and still do not use) Facebook, Twitter etc. A distant friend uses WhatsApp for a weekly video call but I have not yet attempted to find out how to use that. I am having to learn to use Zoom for the charity but have found it difficult so far – I am getting to my limit in learning new technology. It does not come naturally! Shopping and Food My daughter has been very helpful and brings me small amounts of food and other essentials (I originally moved to live near her but never imagined quite how useful that would be). And several friends have offered to get me things. But for most food I use the Iceland delivery service online. I do though have great trouble in finding available delivery slots. I am told that the time to do this is at or after midnight but that so far has been a step too far. I have never managed to find a Tesco delivery slot. Many local shops now deliver but have limited resources. If all fails, my daughter will add to her normal weekly shop for me. She has one of my bank cards to use or for cash. But I have a full freezer and most of the time a reasonably full food covered. I have had to learn how to plan my needs a week or two ahead. My cooking has not changed a good deal. I am vegetarian (with occasional fish and chips). I am not a keen cook and no longer use recipes though I have learned some basics from my late wife who was a superb veggie cook. For about three or four days’evening meals I make a large pan of pasta sauce or other mixture of vegetables, meat substitute (eg Quorn) with herbs etc and make it last with variations – eg with pasta, rice, potatoes. This saves time and trouble. Breakfast and lunch are still pretty minimal if healthy. I know that is all the wrong way round (breakfast should be larger, tea smaller) but habits stay fixed after many years. Entertainment and Leisure This area has taken the biggest hit, not necessarily because of the lockdown but since my bereavement. I have not felt able to do anything new – I have dabbled in many things in the past and most,thanks to mypermanent state of ‘aloneness’, I no longer have the motivation to attempt: poetry writing, painting and drawing. I do write in a notebook – ideas for poems which never come about or observations and, of course, Mass Observation writing which has been helpful in giving my writing a purpose. One new activity is entering writing and photography competitions, many for the over 70s in isolation. Photography is now limited by having to stay indoors, though I still take phone photos of skies and interior images and now and then have the chance to photograph birds in the adjacent trees. But I have always done that. DIY is now unnecessary: there are things in the flat I could improve but I can live without them – ‘its only me’. Ss already noted I try to stick to a session on my exercise bike every day now with some floor exercises – this as a substitute for daily walking around town. Myabilityto concentrate is now limited, even affecting myTV watching: if a programme doesn’t grip my attention then I’m off channel hopping, looking for something better or, like a teenager, looking at news or You Tube on my i-phone. But there are times when a programme holds me. One recent example which I have seen through twice is a new serial drama about the on/off love affair between two teenagers / students set in Ireland. SallyRooney’s ‘NormalPeople’ (adapted from her novel) has received critical acclaim and I can see why. The acting and direction and spare script are remarkable and sometimes almost make the viewer hold their breath. If this is still available in fifty years’ time, it maywell be a classic. I watched it twice in quick succession using the BBC iplayer catch up service on the digital TV. There are few programmes of that quality and the virus crisis has caused the creation of many new programmes to be suspended, meaning more repeats for the next year or so. Already I am seeking out older programmes but there is, frankly, a lot of dross to wade through to find the odd gem. Currently, as well was the BBC i-player, I have access to Netflix, More Four (Channel Four archive), ITV Hub and Amazon Prime. But most of what is on offer does not appeal. I have noticed that, during isolation, I am instinctively drawn less to crime dramas and more towards family dramas, even comedies – ‘people stories’, seemingly a kind ofsubstitute for meeting real people in the flesh. And subtitles are essential to catch all the dialogue. I do read a little more than I did before isolation, preferably sitting outside in the sun, though I often fall asleep! Day time reading is non-fiction: history, politics, biography, art etc. Friends have lent me books and I have returned the favour. I read novels, mainly on my Kindle e-reader in bed before trying to sleep. I can become lost in them. I have been reading a lot of books about bereavement – somehow this helps, especially in isolation, but reminding me that I am not alone in my experience ofgrief: one impressive novelin these lines is Sebastian Barry’s ‘Secret Scripture’, set in Ireland and centred on a 100 year-old woman in a mental hospital and the hospital director who has recently lost his wife. It reflects many of my feelings and experiences in losing my wife. Grief has become a fascinating subject recently. I no longer listen to radio since my hearing impairment makes this too much of a strain. Personal Hygiene In the light of health advice, I have been washing my hands more often and for longer. As a result the skin on my hands has aged, dry and creased! I now use a barrier cream to try to offset this. Just before the lockdown started, a friend advised me to get a haircut before it was too late. I managed this with a day or two to spare. It should last me another month at least – I try to keep it a little trim using an electric shaver. But I do not want to cut any more drastically than that. So, if I emerge from isolation with shoulder length hair, so be it. I have thought of growing a beard. I wore one for most of my working years and shaved it off, at mywife’s insistence when I retired, asymbolof a new life. But electric shaving is no trouble and is an entrenched habit so at present I will stick with the status quo. Sleep I have had sleep problems for several years – mainly waking up two or three times a night needing the toilet, as a result of an enlarged prostate. Bereavement has made this a little worse. And my hearing impairment makes listening to the radio with earphones, which used to help send me off again, less effective. There has been little difference in isolation – I can normally get between six and eight hours sleep (in instalments). I have recently developed a routine to help go to sleep initially – to read, then relax and then run through in my mind the events and activity of the previous day and what I need or want to do the following day. I tend to go to bed later now and sometimes I do sleep or doze late – with no incentive to get up. But I think most of this is common to a lot of people. I rarely remember dreams. Those I do recall – waking up in the middle -often feature my wife as if all is as it was. She is sometimes warning me about something or telling me something. So far, no nightmares though. But I have had such dreams ever since she died. Isolation has made little if any difference."

AUTUMN DIRECTIVE . HEALTH AND WELLBEING. I am a 53 year old woman married to another woman. I live in a small village in Saddleworth near Oldham. I am a retired Detective Police Officer. What does health mean to me. I suppose it means that you are not in pain,not in hospital or needing medical treatment. Not over or underweight.taking some exercise ,nourished ,hydrated . Getting enough sleep. Wellbeing means to me more about how you feel mentally and emotionally and around stress . Both have a connection and a poor situation in one affects the other. What do I imagine when I think healthy body first 5 words….Strong ,able bodied,medium build,nourished,rested. My identity is based upon a Northern,working class background. My parents were both from very working class origins,both starting work in cotton mills aged 14 so they could only pass on their life knowledge to that extent. Knowledge of different food and cultures was very limited in my childhood years due to my social class and poverty but in my adult years totally reversed as my massive interest in travel and since my mid 20,s in cooking has increased my awareness of all types of foods and ways to live as I have travelled extensively. Being female has made a difference in that I had years and years of difficult periods and eventually a hysterectomy in my late 40,s which was well overdue. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing when and where first aware? I grew up in a 3 bedroom council house . Before my parents divorced aged 9 we were working class but better off and after when my mum was alone we were a lot poorer. There was no spare money . In relation to food we didn't identify it as it is now with either proteins,fat,carbohydrates etc it was either meat or fish,vegetables,potatoes or pasta,fruit or cheese. We knew that it was healthy to eat vegetables but no mention of 5 a day growing up. (I was born 1967 ). having 2 veg was considered acceptable. Salad was a healthy option but we mostly had what I would describe as Northern staple,stodge and filling type dishes. We would have a Sunday roast usually lamb or beef with Yorkshire pudding,roast potatoes veg and gravy but not every week and it was a treat. We had things like meat and potato pie with a suet crust or cheese and onion plate pies. Beef mince broth with dumplings. My Mum had a limited cooking repertoire and taught me the basic things she knew. School home economics didn't really teach me much more . It was only in my mid 2,s when I had 2 close friends who were chefs that I started to learn a lot more and became really into cooking and a self described foodie. Chocolate and sweets were regarded as a treat and bad for your teeth if you ate too many. School dinners were dreadful and put me off some foods but they served a purpose . Milk was seen as healthy for strong bones and my first role of responsibility at junior school was to be milk monitor. I fondly remember the cute little bottles and in the winter they would freeze at the top and bubble over the rim when they iced up or sometimes the birds would peck them. I always enjoyed my bottle of milk with my straw. There was no mention of full fat milk or semi skimmed /skimmed options…it was just milk. Probably not until my late teens early 20,s that concept became more popular and I only started drinking semi skimmed milk later on in life. My parents were responsible for my care when I was younger until about 9 years old when they divorced acrimoniously and then it was my mum who I lived with and an older brother. She took care of me for any medical appointments of which there weren't many as I have always been quite healthy .She had a universal bottle of TCP for any scrapes and grazes . H7512 I cant recall my parents talking about it much at all. Perhaps only that you needed to eat enough so you weren't starving and fruit and veg so you were healthy. Never any conversation about mental wellbeing with them. I gained more education as I grew older from sport mostly. I swam competitively so that gave me more information.I knew that sporting activity was good for you. As far as key moments adolescence puberty I can remember having to get my first bra aged 13 and I was mortified. I was quite happy playing football or cricket with the local bunch of lads as I was a tomboy and the appearance of small breasts marked a difference I really didn't want as it made me different. Mum took me to marks and spencer for a proper bra measurement as was the respectable practice and done thing. A nice older lady helped measure me and I knew it was seen as a milestone event. I found the new item of clothing to be less comfortable than just having a vest or T shirt on and to be honest I would have rather not bothered. As for my first period. I can still cringe with embarrassment and blush at the thought and memory. I started my period unexpectedly when I was 13 . I was away on holiday with my mum staying at a hotel in Bournemouth. When I realised I went to speak to my mum who was in conversation with a group of women in the lounge. I tried to whisper quietly what had happened and wanted to die on the spot when she loudly and proudly announced to the assembled knitting circle that I had started my period. They all made proud remarks about it. I was really embarrassed as I didn't want a load of strange people knowing in public. So she dragged me off to the nearest chemists and I was bought some really old fashioned and massive sanitary towels. The sort with big loops on that were really thick . My mum probably used them and in her day they were the thing . For that week of the holiday I had no choice as they were the solution but for me as a regular competitive swimmer in the pool almost every day they were not practical . The towels were also massive and less than discreet . I knew my friends used tampax so for the next period I got some myself bravely marching into Boots and buying them .My mum didn't want me to use them as she thought they could be bad for young girls. I think she had some odd idea that my virginity was in question using them but I was adamant i was not using the towels she gave me. This week in 2020 I see the Scottish government has announced free sanitary products for all . Good for them. I could never understand why they were always taxed why ?when 50 % of the population are female. Starting your periods is seen as a milestone and also raises the concept of pregnancy. My mum gave me a book about sexual education. It was handed over in an embarrassed fashion and I was invited to read it . It wasn't a big book and was very medical ,with biological instructions about how people breed. She wasn't comfortable having a conversation with me and to be fair neither was I. I cant remember ever talking about it with my Dad at all. School sex education was equally limited. We had THE class in biology and it was old fashioned medical descriptions about pregnancy . No real instructions about condoms or how to use them properly . The pill being mentioned as contraception and absolutely no discussion about sex being for any solely pleasurable reason. No mention of STD,s and absolutely no mention of same sex relations. So for me as a gay woman, a less than expansive educational experience. Amongst my female friends there was conversation about the topic and I think the lads had what would have been described then as dirty magazines but they were an illicit thing. Not like now where young people have so much internet porn access its scary. H7512 I have never,unlike many of my female friends ,dieted. I like my food and I have a sort of resistance to dieting to suit other peoples expectations. I don't like the problem of anorexia you see in society and see it as a slow way to kill yourself. People who are too thin worry me.So I have probably always been a bit heavier than ideal BMI weight but still strong active and able to do sports . Also working horrendous shifts for 32 years you end up eating crap at odd times and its hard to eat healthy at 3am sometimes. I have never liked going to the gym and hate the posing lycra gym bunny types. I have always enjoyed team sports and played football,squash then badminton until my knees started creaking too much .Now as I,m growing older I do exercise at home or go for a walk. I know that taking some exercise is good for me but I don't do that much . I have a variety of foods and try to eat plenty of fresh vegetables in my cooking. I would say now people generally are much more aware of being healthy and much more emphasis is given to it. In future years my expectations are that I will be less strong and will have to take more gentle exercise . As for how people relate to external appearance I can see that being fit ,thin and athletic,suntanned etc is popular . Across all types of media the modern image of women in particular is not something I like. The pouty selfies and lip fillers etc in my opinion look dreadful and it must be hard for young women coping with the perceived pressures of how to look. For me I have never been that bothered with fashions and decided a long time ago I will dress in a way I ,m comfortable with. So i,m usually in jeans,combat pants or walking type gear. I have never worn make up and I don't want to comply with the stereotype box of how a woman should look. I suppose in a way I don't care. Partly my sexuality has influenced that as Ive never felt comfortable being girly . My desert island item would be a hammock with a mosquito net attached as I get bitten to death by them and at least I could sleep at night and hopefully use my watching of Tv about Ray Mears or Bear Gryls would have given me the other skills to live my castaway life . In getting ready to leave the house rituals. My parents would have always made sure they were washed,hair brushed and clean clothes before leaving the house. Dad would have always shaved and applied aftershave like Old Spice or Brut…yes I know…how cliched but true. I am the same in that I would have a shower ,dry my hair ,apply deodorant and some perfume . Clean clothes always before leaving the house. My regime would be speedy though and practical. Especially when I was working I had perfected getting up at stupid o clock times and a whirlwind of throwing myself in the shower,dressed,coffee quick breakfast and out. WELLBEING. I think these days there is so much more knowledge about the importance of it and impact on our lives. Growing up it was the opposite. Perhaps peoples attitudes were more stoic and just got on with it or just didn't know. H7512 Particularly through my work I know the importance of wellbeing. I have lost count of how many suicides I have seen in any manner you can imagine. Grisly,nasty and tragic. I cant imagine ever feeling that bad and I feel really sorry for the family and friends left behind with guilt and unanswered questions. I have seen people who are just broken including,sadly ,several colleagues who have taken their own lives. I have always had a strong thought that I never want to be like that and want to take care of myself. Through work in 32 years the effect of stress is well known to me . I have operated in very high and sustained levels of it. I believe some stress is healthy and can drive you to perform but too much can have some very bad results. I have seen many people just burn out from it. Fortunately I am an emotional person and if something is wrong I have to deal wth it and get it out. I wear my heart on my sleeve. The downside to that is you care and you feel things deeply. The upside ,in my opinion, is that I process it in one way or another instead of bottling it up. I worked as a family liaison officer on homicides and natural disasters or accidents. Part of the role and training prepares you for the difficulties , it is a demanding and emotionally challenging role. We had a mandatory yearly counselling session as a welfare check as well as the opportunity to request counselling at any stage if we needed to. In my role investigating homicides we also had a system where some or all of the team would be automatically referred if it was a particularly bad case.This probably happened 6 or 7 times for me. I never felt overwhelmed or that I had problems with these cases,bad though they were as I saw it as my job. On 2 separate occasions I have felt overwhelmed and that I needed some counselling for trauma and they both involved the sudden,random and unexpected murder of 3 colleagues on duty. The first happened when I was 22 and resulted in 1 of my colleagues being shot dead and another very seriously injured but he survived. I was present in the immediate aftermath to help them and it was undoubtably traumatising. What I found hard was the realisation that someone could kill them and worse perhaps me. It made me feel generally unsafe going forward doing my job. I had some PTSD dealing with the sights and emotions of the night . Guilt that I couldn't save them,anger that it had happened and fear that it might happen again. I had some counselling sessions whilst still working and they were helpful but in hindsight I always had an unresolved fear and memory of the event for years after. Then it happened again 24 years later …totally out of the blue . This time 2 young female colleagues shot dead. I knew both to say hello to and was based at the same location. This time I wasn't present. I was actually on holiday in Devon and when I heard I drove back home to offer my help to the staff. This event just magnified my feelings from the first time and I sought counselling sessions again as it hit me really hard even though I wasn't present this time. It brought up all the same emotions . Attending both funerals was the worst experience and it hit us all really hard. About 300 staff based at the location and our shifts were very kindly covered by colleagues from all over the UK so we could attend the funerals. That was so nice of them. I had several counselling sessions and eventually I felt better. My stress inbox had reached its limit and needed help. I was not ashamed to admit it. I kept working the whole time and it was a bad and difficult period. I feel if I hadn't sought some help it would have been bad for me. Sadly a couple of years later one of our colleagues took his own life on the anniversary. He filled in his own death report and left it in his pocket. Tragic and awful in equal measure. When I retired a couple of years later I felt glad that I had done so relatively intact . I know so many people who drink heavily have multiple divorces and are damaged and a lot of it involves stress and lack of wellbeing. I had long planned a big retirement trip and I took the unusual option of taking a freighter ship from Hong Kong to New Zealand via China. 25 days at sea. It was the best thing ever. I read 9 books . My only responsibility was to attend meals and safety drills and the crew looked after me really well as their only passenger. I got the idea from watching Around the world in 80 days and researched how to arrange it. H7512 During the trip I let go of and deleted loads of thoughts,memories etc. I took it as an opportunity to let go. The end of a long hard working career and the start of my new life. It did me the world of good. Since retiring my wellbeing balance is in my opinion very good. I have very little stress now,only normal life admin things .I sleep and eat well at normal times . I have time to relax and do things I enjoy . I think in our modern lives things go so quickly and we are almost always connected there is no off switch and its a bad thing. Attaining a good work life balance is almost impossible .For women with families I think that challenge is even harder.Being a great mum and having a great career are often at odds and I have seen many female cops who did not complete a full career and concentrated their efforts on family but they were very capable in work . In the future I think the focus will change and I think they will look back and ask what the hell were you all doing to yourselves? it was too much…but that will take a long time I suspect. At 53 I feel Ive learned over the years that you need to look after yourself and you only live once . 30.11.20"

To be able to work, look after your family and enjoy recreation. It is maintaining this by making healthy choices. Keeping fit and eating a good diet. Since Covid it also means staying fit and well in difficult circumstances including social distancing. Well-being is how you feel about your life. It is acceptance, contentment, positivity, having a purpose in life. It is also preventative action such as enough sleep, healthy eating and exercising. Again, since the start of the pandemic, it means taking preventive measures against catching the virus. “A healthy body” – strong, slim, flexible, muscular, positive walk. The image of a person who is able to move without pain. Is smiling and positive to others. Clear skin, shiny hair. Good posture. Healthy weight for height. Dressed in clean clothes. Looks alert and interested in life. Identity I think gender has played a part in my experience of health and wellbeing because women read a lot more about healthy choices, as the physical attributes of a healthy body tend to involve weight, fitness, and diet. Also there are a number of press articles on healthy choices, alternative medicine and preventative action largely aimed at women. Attractive women are healthy women. I think social class has also influenced me as many places which promote healthy exercises (e.g. Gym, swimming pool) are expensive and so are not somewhere I could imagine myself going to regularly. Growing up and learning about health and well-being Health was something I became aware of whilst growing up by the things my mother taught me regarding healthy choices. I was also influenced by my father’s ill health; he suffered a serious heart attack when I was a child. I learnt about wellbeing as an adult – when I had reached burnout myself. Before receiving advice, I thought of well-being as a luxury. I now see it is something we all need to think about. P7500 My mother looked after my health. Conversations about health were generally about illness at the time of the illness e.g. what to do if you suffered a cold, stomach-ache etc. I do not remember any conversations about why. I think the conversations were about practical action. We did learn about puberty and some information about health in our biology lessons. Sometimes there were health education lessons. I have learnt a great deal from magazine articles, NHS website and the internet generally. Key moments My mother gave me a book about puberty. She never talked to me about bras or periods (or childbirth or the menopause). I felt embarrassed and it was not something to be spoken about. I am not sure about what specific rituals would be, it was not something I experienced. Growing older Due to past physical illnesses, I have tried to keep a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep. I think this has become more important during the pandemic. Mental health – I am in recovery from a mental illness. I sought help when thing got very difficult and received therapy privately for several years as there was very little short-term help available on the NHS. I was taught various ways to maintain good mental health which I regularly practise. Before seeking help, I did  not think there was anything I would be able to do to help myself. It changed the way I live. At present I get information from trusted medical internet sites and medical professionals. I am more aware of my physical and mental health now as I know how important it is to maintain good health all the time, not just when things go wrong. In future years I expect to slightly adjust my expectations as my body gets older but continue to maintain good health to the best of my ability. It is about living the best life you can. Health, wellbeing, and appearance I think the media encourage us to believe appearance, health and wellbeing are all interconnected in a particular way. This usually involving youthfulness and good looks. I think they are interconnected but  visible in expression, positivity, and curiosity rather than popular ideals of beauty. When I was in my 20s, I was influenced by popular ideals of beauty and worked hard to try to achieve a certain image. I believed looking ‘healthy’ would mean I was liked and popular. This was not about healthy eating, healthy exercise, or good mental health. The inner beauty this can give is far more important throughout life. P7500 My mother was always worried about my weight when I was a child. She was very slim all her life and ate very little. Even in her 90s she was worried about her hair and gaining weight. I do not think she ever stopped worrying about her appearance during her entire life. She read a lot of health magazines, but these were about looking good rather than a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps this was indicative of the times she grew up in (1920s), when women were valued almost entirely for their appearance. The only health product I couldn’t live without is my Fitbit. It ensures I am aware on a regular basis of exercise, sleep, and diet, which I find really useful. I would take it to a desert island with me, provided I could charge it! Getting ready to leave the house I particularly remember my mother leaving the house. She would always brush her hair and put on some more make-up. There was always a full length mirror in the hall so she could check her outfit before leaving the house. Even as an elderly lady she would always check in the mirror before leaving the house. My routine has changed over time. Before having children, I would do something similar to my mother. I would not be happy to leave the house without makeup and hair being right and having makeup etc in my handbag. After children I did not have time to check my appearance as much, there wasn’t time. I would only change into a different outfit if I was going out somewhere very nice. Since my children have left home, I am more likely to get changed and put on makeup again and check myself in the mirror. However, since the COVID 19 pandemic I hardly go out and the lack of socialising means again in my life I rarely bother with makeup or to change my outfit before leaving the house. When I look around me, I think I am not alone in this! I expect I will again become more careful about my appearance before leaving the house when the pandemic and social distancing ends."

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Health means being fit enough to do all the things that I want to do – run, walk, gardening, going out, being comfortable in my own body at all times. Wellbeing is more of a mental state, accompanying health. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Strong, slim, active, toned, blooming Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. A female athlete like Serena Williams or Jessica Ennis Hill. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? It has been influenced by social class in that I can afford to buy myself quality foods and access support networks such as masseurs, trainers to help me keep fit. Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I have been influenced by my husband in that he has always been a committed amateur athlete. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? In my twenties when I took up running. At the same time I read an article in the Guardian about animal welfare and decided to become a vegetarian which I remain. Wellbeing is a more recent construct. I tried meditating but could not settle to it. I have been doing yoga for twenty years. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My mother Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? No. I can remember my mother going on a diet – The Drinking Man’s Diet – when she was in her mid-thirties. If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? There was much talk in the family about the diet as it impacted on our meals. Other than that there was no discussion of health or wellbeing. Did you receive any education about health in school? No And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Magazines of the day – Jackie – discussed skin, teeth, body odour etc Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? When I was eleven Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? For young women their first period. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I was very frightened. My mother had warned me but it was worse than I had expected. None of my friends ever talked about it so I was clueless. I remember the paraphernalia surrounding periods was a real bind. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? I have had a regular routine of running four or five times a week since I was in my mid-twenties. I did several marathons and triatholons. My most recent marathon was when I was 66. Before I had children I cycled to and from work every day and swam twice a week. I have been vegetarian for forty years. I now do yoga every day. Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Having children meant I curtailed some of my activities. I would say I am still as active but at not such a high level as in my twenties. I do set myself goals and enjoy that aspect of running. I am fortunate in that I still maintain the same healthy weight as I had as a young woman Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? The Guardian and online. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? More aware as I can feel I am slowing down. I am more anxious about falling over when running. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Only in as much as my body might not let me do so much. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? There is a tendency to equate health and wellbeing with a certain body type, a certain agility of movement and demeanour. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I don’t think so. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Not at all. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? Lip balm which I make myself. What would be your Desert Island item? E45 cream. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? None come to mind and I have asked my siblings if they remember anything. Our parents never went out in the evening as far as we can recall. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Keys, mobile – check. Front door – push against it to be sure it’s shut. Look back at the house from the street to check the windows are closed. Only became this security conscious after being burgled. Otherwise no other routines now that I am retired and have more time for things."

D.’s symptoms were more long-lasting than mine – I would say he has taken a month to recover and only now is saying his chest is no longer tight. I tried to get medical help for D. but the doctor’s number was always busy and we were advised to use NHS 111, which I did. I took their advice and it seemed effective. If anything I have felt better mentally and emotionally than I was expecting. I am enjoying the slower pace of life, and feel that while have I a garden and allotment and company of D. then all is well. I miss my daughters but have been able to see them at a distance when they deliver food. The Government I am totally exasperated by the Government as they seem utterly inept in comparison with Germany, New Zealand or even Scotland. I realise these are countries all led by women but they seem so much more competent and rational. We seem to be being softened up for a considerable relaxation of the lockdown rules to save the economy. I will not be following them unless I am convinced that they are right for me and D. as he is in the vulnerable category. News I am listening to the daily briefing via Radio 4’s PM programme. In the beginning I watched them live on TV, then switched to radio. I feel it is disrespectful to send out minor politicians to front up the briefings. They seem to b e completely out of their comfort zone and just mouthing platitudes. I have only seen Johnson do one since he returned from sick leave. We need a leader with gravitas and dignity. Sadly he has neither. The media, with a few exceptions, seems unable or unwilling to challenge the narrative that is being formulated from Number 10. I would feel much happier if Cummings and his entourage were removed totally from the seat of power but the waffle we are given at these briefings seems to come direct from them. I think that using BSL at these briefings is a good idea. I read the Guardian every day. I subscribe to the Politico daily emails and I have found them very useful. I look at Twitter less and less. Work and home life I am retired and my daughters do not live with me. My home life has not been impacted adversely. Technology I have been using Zoom to do my yoga and exercise classes, my bookgroups and family/friend meetups. I have found the experience very rewarding, especially with the yoga classes. I am doing three a week instead of my normal once. In my bookgroup the participant who normally tends to dominate the discussions has let everyone have a go and this is an improvement. Family ones have been a godsend. We have a quiz, a meal and some drinks for about two hours. We have done this twice so far. Houseparty – we used this at first but now I speak to my daughters on WhatsApp video call. I don’t use Facebook. I play Words with Friends 2 with my sister every afternoon and we then chatt for about half an hour .on WhatsApp. We did this before lockdown. Shopping and food In the first week of lockdown the handle broke on my oven and it is impossible to get a repair or replacement oven at the moment. So I found an old oven from when we went camping and am using that if absolutely necessary. It has meant I am not doing all the baking that others are doing. The shortage of flour (I make my own bread) has been a problem but I have now ordered a 16kg bag from a mill in the Cotswolds. I heard about the problems with flour on Farming Today and the millers national association has put a useful set of links to local millers on their website. I have only been shopping locally. I have not been to a supermarket since mid March. Our local Budgens has almost everything I need. We have been ordering alcohol from the local brewery who deliver the same day. I think prices have gone up but I accept that and am not spending my money on anything else. We are eating and cooking much the same as before – apart from not being able to use an oven. Entertainment and Leisure I have been watching much less television as has D. (no sport). I have been listening to much more radio. I am working my way through Neil MacGregor’s History of the World in 100 objects; listening to the Gresham lectures when I go for a walk; going through the Drama category on BBC Sounds and listening to one of those a day. Music – I am not a music lover but have been playing Bob Dylan’s Murder most Foul several times every day. I watch the live streamed National Theatre productions every Thursday evening. I was a regular theatregoer before the lockdown. I have continued to run every other day – I was due to do a 10K race this month but that has been put on hold so I just keep ticking over doing no more than 20 miles a week. I do yoga every morning – Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube and three days a week I do a Zoom session with my regular yoga teacher. I also do an exercise class once a week with my regular exercise teacher. Reading – I find it difficult to concentrate. I have read the books that my book groups are doing. I started the latest Hilary Mantell but finding it hard to read a complex, multi-layered book. I had a pile of books set aside to read when the lockdown started but not one has been touched. I do some crochet every day. I am making Twiddle Muffs for the elderly from odds and ends of wool that I have left over. Personal hygiene I am lucky in that my hair is completely grey so I’m not worried about my roots but I could really do with a hair cut. I may have to attack my fringe before very long. Apart from that my hygiene routines have not really changed. Sleep My sleep has surprisingly been better than normal. I usually have real trouble with insomnia but have hardly had any problems for the whole time. I wake early – 5 – put on the radio and listen until six when I get up. I go to bed at 10."

I don’t know who comes to mind when I think of a healthy body. Perhaps my friend S who is very keen on exercise. She does yoga, runs in 10k runs regularly and also volunteers for a scheme called “Good Gym”, where you run several miles to meet up with other volunteers, carry out a good deed, like doing shopping for an elderly person or clearing up leaves in a park, then you run home again. A really good idea. If only I enjoyed exercise... I really don’t get the endorphin rush which everyone talks about and I just end up feeling uncomfortable and overheated. Identity I’mnotaware ofmy healthand wellbeing being affected by gender, class,sexuality orethnicity. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I don’t know when I first became aware of health and wellbeing. I don’t think of it as being very prominent as I was growing up, although my mum always struggled with her weight, as does my sister, so there were always low-fat versions of food around, or “Slimfast” products.  My mum doesn’t enjoy cooking someals would be quite simple. I rememberher nagging my grandparents a lot about eating too much fried food, and she even went round and confiscated their frying pan on one occasion! So she certainly had an awareness of health, even ifI’m not aware of her doing proper nutritional balancing of ingredients or anything.  My dad has honey and cider vinegar every morning and believes it is good for a lot of ailments. I have just remembered that they used to buy health supplements from a company called Shaklee quite regularly – I think perhaps some friends of theirs were salespeople for the company. I suppose my first awareness of health would be through my grandparents –apart from the fried food, my grandad had a number of heart attacks and was a smoker, and my grandma had a stroke, so these would have been the first people I knew who had serious health problems. I’m sure my parents must have a healthier lifestyle than my grandparents did. Awareness is much better now. Key moments For girls, the key moments suggested – buying a bra and the first period – spring to mind as significant. I have a vague memory of being in a changing cubicle with my mum when buying a bra, but don’t remember any conversations about the subject. I expect we would both have found it embarrassing. To teach me “the facts of life” I was given an Usborne book called something like “How YourBody Works” – Usborne books were (are?) excellent at explaining all kinds of subjects clearly and accessibly, and of course it avoided us having to have a conversation about it!  My mum asked if I had any questions after I’d read it and I said no.   When I got my first period I think I struggled by myself for a while, going to the corner shop to buy sanitary towels etc, before finally justleaving a note on my mum’s bedside table to tell her (and again, to avoid an embarrassing conversation).  After that, she bought sanitary towels for me.   Female, 45, single, Walthamstow, stage manager Growing older I have been vegetarian since I was 9, although this was motivated by animal welfare concerns rather than by health considerations. I feel likeI’mvery mainstreamnowthatvegandiets have come to such prominence, but when I first went vegetarian there were very few choices when it came to prepared food and eating out in cafes or restaurants. My mum is not a great home cook so I ate a lot of microwaved veggie lasagnes when I was growing up. Nowadays I do not have a microwave and eat very few processed meals (perhaps a microwave meal during a busy week at work occasionally, but it’s possible to get much healthieroptions now). Iamconscious of eating healthily but itis also what I naturally like. I don’t have a particularly sweet tooth so it is quite easy to avoid too much of those things. I usually have oats with almond milk, chia seeds and a banana for breakfast, and other regular meals include rice noodles with veg, or a stew made with root veg, lentils, pearl barley, tinned tomatoes and various spices. Very easy but also healthy and cheap. There is an excellent cheap veg market near me where I get all my fresh food, and also a vegan “refill shop” has opened this year, where I get all my dry goods and discover new products.   I used to drink regularly and probably too much because theatre is a very sociable profession, but I more or less gave up nearly two years ago. I just wasn’t enjoying it as much and would often get a headache after one or two drinks so there didn't seem any point in having any. I have tried many non-alcoholic alternatives and now buy a range of alcohol-free beers from an online company called Dry Drinker or sometimes I will just have tonic with a dash of angostura bitters – delicious! I was more aware of drinking being an unhealthy habit as I got older, and it was easy to stop once I’d made the decision.   I am probably more aware of my body now, but also more relaxed about it and happier with it. I used to be bothered by the fact that I didn't have a flat stomach, even though I am a fairly “normal” weight, and I would try to do exercises for this, but now I accept that that will never happen. People have different natural shapes and that is still not publicised, in spite of backlashes from time to time against the beauty industry. I think it’s irresponsible of magazine articles orinstructors onfitness videos to say things like “do this and you’ll have aflat stomach in six weeks” whenactuallythat may be beyondsomeone’s capability,depending ontheir body shape and metabolism. Now I can accept my body shape and just choose clothes to suit it. I expectasI get older I will carry ondoing what I’mdoing with diet etc, and itwill become even more important. As I said earlier, I dislike exercise so that is one thing I could do to be healthier. Perhaps as I get older I will be more aware of being active and at least go out for walks quite regularly. I do have a deep fear of health problems and how serious things can arise with no symptoms, even in people who live a so-called healthy life. I try to put these things out of my mind but I imagine this fear could get worse as I get older.   Health, wellbeing and appearance People can perhaps feel more confident if they know they are well-presented or if they are wearing a flattering item of clothing. Perhaps if someone has got into a rut, a change of hairstyle or wardrobe can give them a boost, but there has to be some change under the surface as well. I don’t think I am at all influenced by popular ideals of beauty and appearance. I don’t read beauty magazines and actually get quite riled if I do see one of these magazines which just has endless pages of beauty products or expensive fashion items. I think people waste so much money on products and procedures which aren’t necessary – colouring their hair, having nails done, pricey skincare products. I do not have a Desert Island beauty item! The only products in my bathroom are shampoo, aqueous cream washing bar (soap equivalent for eczema), toothpaste, and Aveeno moisturiser. Perhaps this partly comes from my upbringing, although I just don’t think it’s in my character to prioritise things like that. My sister is slightly gothic and wears a bit of eyeliner and also experiments with different hair colours (currently purple!). My mum and aunty never wear makeup or perfume and nor did my grandma. My grandma always used to say “Nice faces don’t need makeup”. My mum is the least vain person I can think of and I wouldn’t say she was influenced by beauty ideals at all, but she did dye her hair for a long time. I’m not sure when she actually started going grey, because for as longas I can remember she always used a wash-in brown dye which she did at home. She only stopped doing that a few years ago (she is now 80). On the other hand, I have started going grey and have no intention of starting to dye my hair. Once you start, how do you ever stop? And it wouldn’t feel that I was being “authentic” if I did that. I think more women should be open about the colour of their hair, otherwise nobody thinks that it’s normal to start finding grey hairs in your 20s/30s/40s, which it is. After all the hairdressers closed down earlier this year there was a backlash against hair dye but I fear that it won’t last and people will go back to dyeing their hair very soon, if they haven’t already. Getting ready to leave the house My dad worked as a plasterer so the time he left for work would vary depending on where he had to drive to. He wore work trousers and jacket, work shirt and boots and didn't have a particular routine in the morning, but when he got home he would always wash his hands with Swarfega – there was always a pot of this green gel by the sink and the smell of it is one of the pervading scents of my childhood. He also had a shower every evening rather than in the morning, and got changed into corduroy/moleskin trousers, a checked shirt and a jumper.   My parents often went out in the evening but didn't have a particular routine. They didn't usually go somewhere which involved getting dressed up so once they had eaten their evening meal at 6pm they would be ready to go out if they were just going to a folk club or a ceilidh. My mum sings in a choir so if she was performing in a concert that would involve putting on smarter clothes – a blouse and a long skirt – and perhaps going as far as to put some lipstick on! (This is the only occasion I can think of her using any sort of makeup.) Female, 45, single, Walthamstow, stage manager I don’t have a complicated routine for getting ready for work or to go out – just get dressed, have breakfast and go. I prefer to have a shower in the evenings so I can let my hair dry naturally rather than faffing with wet hair in the mornings, so it doesn’t take me long to get ready."

Look at me on Instagram drinking 2 litres of water a day. When I imagine a healthy body I imagine someone who is a healthy weight, has no skin lesions, a full head of hair, is smiling and is standing upright. I guess Claudia Winkleman? I can’t think when I first heard the word “healthy” -I suppose as a child it was “Eat this, it is good for you.” My parents were very attentive and put a lot of effort into me, giving me a good home cooked diet and taking me for walks and bike rides. Unfortunately I ended up quite plump as a child – for the time, which was the 1980s. I was always . My parents had both been skinny children and were not especially sympathetic. When I was 8, my class teacher said to me “H-----, you are too fat!” As he was virtually spherical himself, this seemed rich. I can just imagine the furore if a teacher said that to a child per now.  One of my information books contained a height and weight chart which I used to look at in horror as I was way over what it claimed I ought to be. Among today’s children, I would be relatively thin – I look back at photos of myself and don’t know what I was worrying about. As described in the first part of this directive I did not go through a normal puberty due to a condition called XX gonadal dysgenesis. When everyone else began developing, I managed to persuade my mum to buy me a 32AA bra that I wouldn’t actually need for several years! Finally diagnosed, I went on HRT when I was 17 and had my first “period” a month later. I found it messy and uncomfortable and still do. Growing older A year ago I was taken to hospital with a suspected TIA and that was the first time I really realised that one day, something in my body will go wrong and kill me. I expressed this thought to my younger sister and she replied “Don’t worry! You don’t look anything near your age!” but that wasn’t the point I was making. I have never been reckless with my health, or anything else really. I’ve never done drugs, and I’ve had fewer than 50 cigarettes in my life. I spent my 30s drinking half a bottle of wine a might but then introduced one dry night a week which is now two or three nights, and my example has persuaded my husband to do the same. I eat plenty of fruit and veg, I don’t have a sweet tooth and my weight hovers round the top end of normal BMI. I have never liked exercise though. I don’t go to the gym or do anything that makes me out of breath. I won the class running race at 5 because I was a head taller than anyone else, but that was the pinnacle of my sporting career. I’ve never had much aerobic capacity. That said, I walk fast, and I walk the dog twice every day. When I turned 40 I started going to vinyasa flow yoga which is hard work, and did that diligently until covid struck. I have done one such class since March 2020 and was so out of shape that I felt like I was wearing a suit of armour. I don’t have the discipline to do it at home with a YouTube video. I worry a lot about my health in future years because I work with family carers, so I have a skewed view of what level of health people can be expect to be in when they’re older. I have to specifically remind myself that not every 76 year old has dementia and two knee replacements. I worry about MOA C5847. I am 43, married, no kids, live rurally in Leics and work 3 days a week for a charity. getting rheumatoid arthritis, which my mum suffers with, as I don’t have much of a pain threshold. My husband calls me “flimsy”. Last time I went for routine bloods, a year ago, I was almost pre-diabetic, which seemed mightily unfair as I have a normal BMI and don’t eat much sugar. Covid means they are not doing routine blood tests at the moment so I have no idea of my current blood sugar level. I am cross about my teeth too.  I only have one filling but it has caused me a lot of gyp and will probably need crowning. At the moment I can’t chew much on that side. My oral hygiene has always been at least silver, so again it seems unfair. For all that the government doles out health advice I think it’s largely the luck of the draw, genetic destiny. We lost my dad unexpectedly earlier this year to a cardiac arrest which shouldn’t have happened. He was only 66, still working, gave up smoking at 38 and was in good health. He had prawn sandwiches for Sunday lunch then basically died on the sofa. OK he was rather fond of processed meat and whiskey, but I see men who are much older, fatter and l than him and they are still walking (waddling) around. It is not fair.  Health is the modern day Puritanism – you may not worry about the state of your immortal soul but you sure as hell worry about your body fat percentage. I used to work with a woman who, along with her husband, was obsessed with the body beautiful. It was quite tragic really, they were so vain, in the gym at 6:30 every day and very controlled with food – although she’d sometimes go mad and eat an entire cheesecake in one go. She is a size 8-10 at most. She once found her husband crying over his reflection because he didn’t look as good as he used to, and once she dieted before going on holiday because she didn’t want to look fat in a bikini next to her son’s girlfriend. If you’re 55 and trying to look as good as a 25 year old you have a problem. My cousin is a recovering alcoholic who found the gym two years ago and seems to be smaller and tighter every time I see her. It has done great things for her mental health. I’m not anti-exericse, I just don’t like it myself. Health, wellbeing and appearance When people say they want to be healthy what they often mean is that they want to look thin in photos. We all know models smoke to suppress their appetite. Of course I have been influenced by popular ideals of beauty, that is inevitable in any culture. However I think I am more inclined than most to decide what looks good to me and dress to that aesthetic. I like to look like a rag doll, or a Tim Burton creation, so I have found the shops and manufacturers that work for that – I would never go to Next or Zara. I hate the outfits I see in magazines. I don’t know anybody else who looks like me. I have a great interest in skincare, it is a hobby really, as the leaning towers of beauty boxes by my bed will attest. I love buying toiletries and I’m knowledgeable, it’s a shame I can’t turn it into a career. If I stopped buying products tomorrow I would literally be okay for 3 or 4 years – sometimes it is a race to use things up before they go off. I have worn make up on and off since I was 8. I used to race to the school library to get to “The Usborne Guide to Make Up and Beauty”, I’d kill for a copy now. I had awful skin in my 20s, really bad acne (this was before I got into skincare) for which full coverage foundation was a lifesaver: I wouldn’t have even walked to the papershop without covering up my spots. Unfortunately, my make up is now again to conceal as much as enhance. Objectively I have great skin but also dark MOA C5847. I am 43, married, no kids, live rurally in Leics and work 3 days a week for a charity. circles, hooded eyelids, invisible eyebrows and the beginning of barcode lines on my upper lip (yet again I will use the word “unfair” as I shouldn’t have barcode lines when I don’t smoke!) I find it quite interesting that my husband, while nobly pretending not to mind either way, prefers how I look with a lot of make up on. (I don’t mean Ru Paul’s drag race, I mean “office” make up as opposed to “Sunday” make up. This has not been the case with previous partners. Getting ready to leave the house is infinitely variable in terms of make-up and clothes. Some days I look lovely and some days I look like Worzel Gummidge. The non-variables are that I will shower, wash my hair, clean my teeth, moisturise my face and body, and use deodorant. My mum, who considers anything more than a quick strip wash immorally self-indulgent, is bemused that my husband and I never ever skip a morning shower, and is aghast that I use body lotion every day or as she puts it “go through this rigmarole”! I would never go camping as I would feel gross all day if I wasn’t properly clean. MOA C5847. I am 43, married, no kids, live rurally in Leics and work 3 days a week for a charity."

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. ‘Health’is an absence of illness, ‘well-being’ takes into account your circumstances. So I can be healthy, but if I’m in a stressful job, or lack material resources, or am not respected, then my well­being is suffering. I think there’s a slightly forced nature to the terminology though -‘well-being’ is something which we talk about in normal discourse but which isn’t normally defined. We can have meaningful conversations about it (“I am concerned for their well-being”) without the term ever being specified. The recent ‘well-being agenda’, particularly as expressed statistically (by the ONS, OECD, Eurostat, various think-tanks and charities, and by academics) is a political manipulation of language. It takes this vague but common term and specifies it in ways which serve those wielding the term but very few others. ‘Well-being’ is one of those terms which itis almost impossible to oppose –so when ‘well-being as defined’ becomes ‘well-being’, it becomes impossible to protest the definition without appearing to protest the concept. The same is true of ‘health’ but to a lesser extent, partly because the discourses around ‘health’, and so the fixedness of its definition, is more established. That can partly be seen in the fact we don’t really have antonyms for either term. Ruskin had ‘illth’, which encompassed things like pollution or materialism – the things which capitalism foists on us for its own survival –and had a vague moral sense. It’s harder to fill out ‘ill-being’ though – and if we’re not sure what that means, then I don’t think we can be confident that we really have any grasp on what its opposite means. A healthy body is one free of illness and impairment. That’s going to take any number of shapes – from the taught muscles of yoga practitioners through soft comfortableness of people who are active but not overly concerned about social norms of ‘beauty’. Having said that, one of the first words that came to mind when you said ‘healthy body’ was “celery”, so clearly I lean towards the ascetic rather than the comfortable. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? J5734 I definitely hold in my head ideas about the way I am ‘meant to’ look. I’ve always run to skinny, and used to run regularly to maintain that. Now I use a gym, partly to keep my body within the dimensions I’m used to, and partly now to build muscle. I’m slightly embarrassed by that, but what definition I have gained has made me a little more secure in my own skin. I’m still pretty puny, but I feel a bit more ‘normally’ shaped. I think that might be a gender thing – the guys on the cover of ‘Men’s Health’were always svelte and muscular (and not at all unlike the ones on the covers of gay magazines), shot in sexy starkly lit black and white. Everyone knows the Hollywood trope of the ‘ugly’ girl taking off her glasses and letting her hair down to be transformed into the ‘beautiful’ girl at the end of the film – but there’s a corresponding trope that even the nerdy men fall within a range ofmuscularity. That’s not, in any way, to compare the masculine pressures around body shape or beauty to those of women – there is a difference of many degrees between the two –but it is something which I’ve always been conscious of. I’m not so sure aboutethnicity, social class or sexual orientation. I think given my positions on those – white, middle class, cis and mainly straight –I’m allowed a wide range of possibilities within that broad hierarchy of bodies. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? My mum always made us eat fresh veg and salad. Carrots for our eyes, lettuce because it was good for us, that sort of thing. That was a normalised thing, we never really questioned it (there’d be no point in questioning it anyway, we’d still have to eat it), and so by the time I was feeding myself it was just common sense. I don’t think there was anything in school, maybe something vague in science. As a teenager, I wanted to take Home Economics as a GCSE, but my school didn’t offer it and my efforts to do it on my own petered out quite quickly. I can’t really remember why I wanted to do it(apart from an argument with the school over an additional GCSE I was taking), beyond thinking it was probably an important set of life skills. Health more broadly wasn’t really a subject we discussed. We had to be properly ill to get a day off school – generally the sense was we should power through and stop being such a wimp about things. It’s taken me years to get that out of my system and to take days off when I’m ill, and I still don’t feel comfortable about it. I will have done so much poor work and infected so many people over the years because of that. There wasn’t really any pressure on us to be physically active either. We weren’t really allowed junk food, so it wasn’t like we had weightpiling on us anyway. I was always pretty bad at PE because my co-ordination wasn’t great and I wasn’t getting the practice of running around in my spare time. Doing sportdidn’t really interest me, and nor did watching it until I was much older. I did develop an eating disorder when I was a teenager, but I think that was more a result of my J5734 mental health generally than anything to do with my body image. (I stopped eating because eating made me feel nauseous. It wasn’t a conscious thing, I don’t think, I certainly wasn’t trying to control my weight.) I’ve always taken  daily vitamin supplements since then, just to make sure I’m getting enough of everything. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I don’t know when I first became aware. I did start shaving quite early, because my dad had a load of the kits they used to give him flying business class, and because I found the fluffy early facial hair quite unattractive. I’ve never really had bad acne, although even in my 30s I still have bad enough skin thatI regularly get spots. I’ve tried doing things about that over the years, but nothing has ever really worked (or maybe I’m not actually worried enough that the cleansing regime has seemed worth the  time commitment). I do remember the first time I was embarrassed about my body in public – me and some friends had been playing a ball game topless when we were about 12 or 13 and a group of girls walked past. It was too late at that point, but I put my shirt back on to make me feel less exposed. I wouldn’t even sunbathe in my own garden topless now –I’d still feel very vulnerable. There are situations in public when I become aware that I don’t have an attractive body –I’m not unattractive, but I’m nowhere near the ideal. I feel uncomfortable around attractive people for that reason, which is ridiculous. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I used a gym as a teenager, I think as a means of trying to achieve a more ‘normal’ body – less rangy, less puny. It didn’t really work, I don’t think – potentially a metabolism thing, potentially a lack of protein thing, probably a not really knowing what I was doing thing. I was always never really working towards that sort of hyper-muscled body, I always thought people like that looked a bit freakish, and were a bit sad for having devoted so much time to something superficial. So probably I was going at things half-arsed Intermittently I’ve run. I did that when I was a uni studentthe first time – university felt very structured around appearance. In hindsight, I’m not sure who I thought I was impressing, but I suppose I was hoping that there would be someone. Later I ran with a group to make friends, and stopped as soon as I moved away. I never enjoyed running, and I think by now it’s probably messed up my knees, but it felt like something I should be doing. Returning to the gym as an adult was largely about burning off excess energy – I was doing it for my mental health rather than anything else. I think that mental health has benefited from the changes in my physique now. I have a set of tattoos I got when I moved to my new house, because J5734 the mirror on the bathroom cabinet was opposite the shower, and I had to see myself every morning. Having the tattoos gave me something better to look at than my body. I’m a lot more comfortable with that reflection now though – it still looks pretty puny by most standards, but it seems a bit more human-looking. Now the gyms are shut again for another COVID lockdown, I’m doing yoga every day. That doesn’t really feel like exercise, but does feel like I’m at least making an effort and not letting myself slide completely. I’m still careful about getting my vitamins –that’s partly because I’m a vegan, and want to make sure I’m not losing anything. Now I’m using the gym, I’m also taking a protein supplement to make the gym a bit less purposeless. I think this is probably something I’ll keep doing for the rest of my life. I don’t want to end up with a beer gut, or struggling to walk up the hill to my house. It’s not anything excessive –I’m not going to start running marathons or getting into competitive sport – but is more a maintenance of the sort of body I’m used to having. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I think the relation between health and wellbeing and appearance is probably quite loose. At the extremes – obese, anorectic or bulimic, hyper-muscular bodies; the over and dried-out sun-tanned – unhealth can be read from the appearance, but most people fall in a range of ‘good enough’, hiding whatever else they’re doing (the lung cancer, the sclerotic arteries, the gin-soaked liver, or whatever). I’m not sure what my parents thought abouttheir bodies –I’m not really sure I ever saw them as having that sort of internal life. (Like, it’s obvious that your parents are thoughtful and caring individuals, but it doesn’t really occur to you as a child thatthey think or care about similar things to you. Their mental life is alien and largely unreflected on, I think.) My dad now walks his 10,000 steps a day, largely as part of a calorie control against the beer that he drinks, so he’s clearly concerned about his physical condition. That, I think, is probably to do with his fear of age and mortality, which seems reasonable. I don’t think there are any health or beauty products I could do without. I use face masks, but that’s more about taking 20 minutes out of my week to not do anything than the skincare benefits. (Which would be nice, but at this point in my life I’ve sort of given up on the idea that my skin will be anything other than occasionally eruptive.) I think if you’re stuck on a desert island, skincare is probably the least of your worries. At that point, maybe, a yoga mat, just to give me a flat surface to exercise on. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? J5734 My mum worked at home, and my dad worked away a lot, so I don’t really remember them going out much. When I worked in an office or in university teaching, I always wore a shirt – I think I thought it made me look more ‘professional’-and often glasses to make myself look ‘clever’. My current job is a lot more informal, and now we’re working at home in the middle of winter, I’ve got to the point where I’ll do Zoom calls while wearing a blanket. Beyond that, I don’t think there’s anything special I do – I think if I were going out for a meal I might dress up, but only if there was a risk I couldn’t get in dressed normally. I’ve reached the pointin my life where I’ll wear trainers with a suit and only keep a pair of shoes for funerals. I have a set of clothes I feel comfortable in (primarily jeans, slightly baggy t-shirts and hoodies), and I wear them for all occasions."

Covid 19 and time March to August I was working on the bed apart from one day a week when I went into the office to collect and process the post.   In August I took an extended DSE (Desktop assessment) and was given permission to return full time.   I explained that MDW was also teaching from home, with video and there was no more space for another desk and chair that I was having to take meetings and calls in the bathroom, for security and privacy, since the students could hear me, and that my back was hurting.   The boss made it clear the other 3 officers and 5 assistants should continue to work from home, and that I had to jump through a lot of hoops to return.  At the start I was shopping once a fortnight in gloves and mask; this changed to once a week.  MDW did not go into a shop till about September. I did not always take the daily exercise since by the river, where we live was very busy.  Homelife I had never worked at home before lockdown. The VPN was a pain, and much slower working on one screen rather than the business need which is 2. There was no clear airlock between work and home. Normally the 25 minute walk back with music, is my chill out time.  I did take my full hour break, rather than working through as usual, since I was preparing a mid day meal for MDW.  As we live in a studio flat, it is quite cramped.  I bought a special, very heavy bag, to store my work stuff at home.  The summer was when we could not go out, our friends from Sweden had to cancel their visit, once I was back the weather turned.  Lots of rain.  Very cold.  Married Cambridge Admissions Officer Now I am back to work, I carry all my folders on my back and have to carry the laptop in my hand. There are 38 steep stairs to my office, the lift is out of order. The heating is turned off as apparently this does not meet covid requirements so very cold in the office.  I have been wearing 2 cardigans and a scarf - but still better than working at home. I am up and down the stairs all the time. The cafe nearby, Area, is open so I mask up to get my takeaway lunch - a hot chocolate with plant milk, and a grilled mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich on brown bread. MDW is my priority - he had first dibs on the workspace as teachers always do a lot of work at home even in normal times, prepping lessons and marking. His school is in the top 1% of the top 1%.   My office meets 3 x a week on Skype, no video to check in on workload and everyone.  However we chat throughout the day for work related matters on pop up Skype messages.  Appraisals, which I administered to TC and PA for the first time, and my own were done on Skype meetings.  The same is true for 121s.  We MUST have 4 a year though pre covid it was once a month.  As my line managees are part time I do theirs every 6 weeks.  Homelife  When I was working at home for 5 months I logged in at 9, and took full lunch break 1-2. Then finished work 5-5.30 and started tea. I did do less laundry, as we went out less and I could wear an outfit for more than 1 day, as I have a new outfit every day at work.  This is just as well as when I went to the bank for change for the laundrette, I was in the queue for 2 hours.  I was not impressed.  Even now the only bank open on a Saturday will not give out change.  26 years a customer and they refuse change which I know they have.When the shutdown first happened there were a lot of shortages - could not get flour, eggs, pasta or toilet rolls.  Even when supermarkets put restrictions on them.  TC brought me eggs and flour in exchange for an Ipad cover.  This must have been what it was like at the start of WW2 before rationing.  I spent ages going to shop to shop for items.  Married Cambridge Admissions Officer At least TC meant I could bake my own cake in May. We have not saved money as instead of being able to borrow library books every week I bought them from Ebay and Amazon. Also other things we could not get in the shops.  Mealtimes are mostly set by me but also to fit with lessons breaks for MDW. We only had a couple of arguments.  Luckily we get on well so much - many of our friends are divorced. I read and he games or we watch Netflix or Amazon Prime. Our favourite restaurant near work has closed forever. They did amazing steaks for him and salmon for me.  My brother in law, nephew and niece all lost their jobs.  The latter 2 are young and have got some work now.  Our best man, who has a high flying job, was unemployed for 10 months.  Media and technology Yes.  Skype meetings only for work.  Have not seen the majority of my colleagues since March and those that came in for IT since August were for 10 minutes.  So weird not to hug them.  PKA was fed up so I posted nail varnish set to her for her birthday. VPN log in when WAH. Online medical appointments do not work for things that need to be looked at e.g. cancer, injuries.Also I pay for flu jabs and cannot get one for love or money. Shopping online OK for Iceland but not for other shops - cannot get slots/prefer to shop in person/do not like their substitutions.  I always use a paper diary, I made more notes from calls, I use notepads to log the books I read, and I have a gratitude diary.  I am not a fan of working at home - I get that if you travel a lot to work, it is a big saving on time, and petrol.  But I walk.  I am also the first aider and deputy evacuation controller.  On the first day in August I was called to a collapsed female.  She only needed to go home, as it was faint.  But if I had not been in, work would have called 999 - as they would not take a chance.   Most of my call outs involve ambulances, or A and E/GP visits.  Cambridge  Admissions Officer It is rare only a plaster or Icepack is needed. Waiting  Yes - very much so.  Not seen mother in law since last Christmas - we would normally have seen her at least 2 or 3 times and taken her to the coast.  We afraid in case we take the virus to her. Saw my mother twice - short train journey away.  But not my 5 year old nephew whose party was just Mum and Dad. MDW has been to the pub a few times with a workmate - I am too afraid to join them.  We are waiting to see if we will go to tier 2, as the students have had parties/not distancing and are up to 180 cases per 100, 000.  Before term started it was 43. Waiting for a virus vaccine. Waiting, always waiting. Delays in getting drs and hospital appointment. NM is in hospital - do not think she would be if had been seen in time.  I need some painkillers but such a pain to get through and then get phone call back.  There were huge queues for Tesco at the start BUT they had a second queue for keyworkers, which I am and have the card, so got in sooner.  The bank - horrendous queues."

However, after 2020, I am even more aware of the importance of mental health. So many people have struggled with mental health issues during 2020, particularly during periods of lockdown. I hope this will highlight to the government the need to invest more in NHS mental health services. The word ‘wellbeing’ seems to encompass both physical and mental health and one’s ability to lead a contented life. ‘A healthy body’ conjures up the image of not just a body free of disease but a strong and physically fit physique. The first five words which comes to mind to describe a healthy body are: muscular, toned, powerful, fit, disease-free. These words make me think of the children’s PE guru Joe Wicks. My parents had responsibility for looking after my health and wellbeing when I was young. This was done in a perfunctory manner and certainly didn’t cover feelings or mental health. I suspect I picked up most information from the wide range of books I read as a child. The only information about health given at school was a series of three sex education lessons at the age of 13. I was left pretty much none the wiser afterwards. I went to an all girls’ school and we were taught about the reproduction of rabbits and then told the same applied to humans! I received a book for Christmas from my parents about growing up and sex when I was 13. I read this in private and absorbed the information, but there were no conversations about it with anyone. Puberty was not discussed with my parents, so I just accepted it and got on with it. I have always tried to actively maintain my mental and physical health via yoga, Pilates and frequent walks. I suspect this is why I am told I don’t look my age. I am a healthy weight and physically very mobile, although not an athlete. I would say I am just as aware of my body as ever. My parents were physically fit when they were younger and often played tennis as adults. However, now at 88, they are not physically strong, having not maintained their fitness levels during their middle or later lives. They don’t understand why my husband and I enjoy long walks in the outdoors and think we are wasting our time. I’m struggling to think of a health or beauty product that I couldn’t live without. I guess, because I suffer from very dry skin, it would have to be a heavy-duty moisturiser. As for getting ready to go out for work, I do remember my parents’ routines. My father would get up and cook himself bacon and egg at 7pm. (If anyone else wanted a cooked breakfast, they had to make it themselves). He would follow this with toast and marmalade which would be so liberally applied, the marmalade would ooze out onto the plate. Radio 4 would be on the radio and my father would have his head buried in the newspaper (usually the Telegraph). My mother, who was a teacher and not a morning person, would surface around 8.15 am, drink a strong coffee, smoke a cigarette, then speed off to work in the car in a foul mood. She was so grumpy in the mornings that my brother and I were not allowed and did not dare speak to her. My parents rarely went out in the evenings but when they did (for formal dinners or dinner dances) my mother locked herself in the bathroom for an inordinately long time beforehand and invariably emerged in a glamorous ballgown, high heels and plenty of makeup.  My routine for going to work or socialising is taking a shower, choosing comfortable and appropriate clothing and putting on makeup if I remember. I have never owned a ballroom gown and have no desire for one."

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Health – your body being in the best physical and mental shape it can be according to your personal circumstances – assisted by whatever intervention is necessary to achieve that eg medication, aids, therapies or support network. Wellbeing – treating yourself as well as possible within your financial constraints – nutritionally, physically and mentally What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Body type, ethnicity, age, life-style, maintenance, accepting Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Gaby Logan (Yorath) springs to mind. I realised she is possibly fine-tuned by a team to look presentable on screen but she always looks radiant, clean and bright with a great haircut well presented. Nor does she look starving and deranged like she spends her life trying to keep up her image and appearance with countless preachy fitness videos. Naturally attractive with no signs of plastic surgery or other surgical intervention. It’s possible that in reality she might have to put in a lot of effort to maintain her look. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? I continue to be astounded that medical charts such as the BMI chart illustrate the expectations based on one racial and body type. I have never been a waif and in my youth, I competed in 100m for my school and played on the netball team. Different ethnicities come in a variety of body shapes and sizes eg afro-Caribbean women, like myself, tend to have quite shapely bottoms a Caucasian woman the same height and weight as me is likely to look a completely different shape from me. One health professional presumed that I must consume large quantities of rich and oily Caribbean food and suggested I “control my portions” better and, of course, do more exercise. She certainly looked more “stout” than me I barely managed to hold my tongue. Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Yes, most of my siblings and lots of their children are diabetic. It is a condition that is rampant in Afro-Caribbean and Asian cultures and is quite often hereditary. I am probably the heaviest person in my family and became diabetic in my 40’s whereas my x2 string-bean, former nurse sister’s became diabetic in their 20’s. One profile certainly does not fit all. My eventual diagnosis with diabetes was probably pre­determined and starving myself was never going to prevent it or make it disappear. At a local level (I live in an area with a negligible non-Caucasian community) my diabetic health professionals stick rigidly to the generic guidelines. This is not the case for other family members living in more ethnic diverse areas. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? My father was a diabetic as far back as I can remember and three of my siblings were nurses. We were aware of healthy eating and living from an early age and played outdoors lots. We grew all our own fruit and vegetables – as my parents also did in Jamacia. There was usually a minimum of 8 of us living at home so our diet was heavily plant biased. Both of my parents were factory workers so we did not have a huge income to buy treats such as sweets, crisps and pop we knew that these were only for treats like Bank Holidays, or when other children were visiting, as they were not good for people with ‘sugar diabetes’ in the family. We did not have a car so walked everywhere. We knew we were living a pretty healthy lifestyle and didn’t question it. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My parents and older siblings – there’s about an 18­year age gap between me and my eldest sibling. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Not very often. Mostly on feasting occasions when there might be treats eg Christmas with chocolates and sweets around. Warnings about diabetes and danger of over indulgence. These talks would take place at home when the goodies were being handed out. Did you receive any education about health in school? I remember primary school lessons about food groups, drawing plates of food in portion sizes, drinking milk advice, eating up our school dinners etc In Biology at senior school lessons on vitamins and nutrition and video on health and hygiene and sexual health. And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Jackie and Cosmopolitan magazines shared in groups at school – spots and breath freshening advice in preparation for kissing. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I’d already started getting pubic hair in year 6 at Primary School so I knew that changes were afoot. Started my periods at about 12. I first registered I had breasts when I was walking across ‘The Gap’ between the girls’ school and the boys’ school across the lane one lunchtime in my netball kit. I heard a boy shout “cor look at her tits” I looked around and there was no-one else in the lane but me. I looked down and there they were. I think they must have manifested over-night. I implored my mum to take me to buy and bra that weekend. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? First period. Exciting information to share with friends – comparing notes etc as is modelling of first bra. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? My younger sister is almost one year younger than me we shared a bedroom until I left home at 19 and are very close. She had her first period the week after me and my mother bought us both our first bra on the same shopping trip. Identical but different colours (mine was a slightly larger cup though). I felt cheated and devastated at both of these. Yet another thing I had to share with my little sister! Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Shopped for, cooked and eaten good quality food. Do no drive so I have always done a lot of walking. Gave up smoking but continued drinking – in moderation. Enjoyed myself and lived a busy varied social life and kept good close friends. I was prescribed anti-depressants when I had depression after my father died unexpectedly. I also welcomed the opportunity to have counselling and CBT which was very helpful and came off the anti­depressants after about a year. Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Continue to buy the best quality food I can afford. Have taken and adjusted accordingly health supplements over the years. I have had bouts of anaemia so sometimes have to take extra iron which can be hard on the guts. I became very anaemic at the time I needed a hysterectomy. After my surgery I went into full medical menopause and have had to use HRT patches since then – I was having hot flushes every 30 minutes 24/7 and was exhausted and felt terribly ill. I tried to reduce the strength of patches and the flushes returned almost immediately. I continue to wear the patches as this holds them at bay and keeps my sanity. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? NHS Choices on the internet. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? More aware of my body now. This is because there have been significant physical changes with age. I now have osteoarthritis in my both hands and both feet which are now all mis-shaped and constantly painful – which I am now accustomed to. I am waiting for a series of steroid injections in my right foot and potential surgery for my left and I now walk with a stick since my balance is so precarious and I am not able to walk great distances and now have a Disabled Blue Badge. The important thing is that none of this is life-threatening it’s annoying. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Not much different. I have some of my consultations with health professionals on-line via video-calls. I hope that I can occasionally see someone in real-life. I think that demonstrating flexibility of limbs online doesn’t always present a full picture. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? I tend to shuffle more when I am in a lot of discomfort. I always try to dress smartly and try to walk with purpose and confidence when I go out and am beyond being embarrassed about my stick. When parking in a Disabled parking bay there is nearly always someone who ‘tuts’ as they assume only wheel chair users can use these spaces. This either makes me feel livid or embarrassed depending on my mood and the volume of the ‘tut’. I always insist we park in the bay furthest from the entrance/exit to wherever we are headed. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Nope. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My parents were always very well turned out. They felt it was equally important that we were dressed smartly and cleanly in public. As Ethnic minorities they did not want Caucasian people to be able to find any fault with us or any reason to be hostile ie to be able to call us dirty and slovenly. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? Aldi Lacura day Q10 Day Cream. Palmers Fragrance Free Body Lotion. What would be your Desert Island item? Palmers Fragrance Free Body Lotion. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Mum getting ready for work – headscarf tied under the chin, looking in the lounge mirror and putting on lipstick usually and aubergine/brownish shade from Avon. Popped her lipstick in the bag. Does up the clasp with a click then out the door for her lift-share to work. Dad getting ready for work -jacket on, polish of glasses put them on then popping on his flat cap. Work bag over his head and across his body off out the door for his lift outside the front of the house. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Taking for ever to decide what to wear. Go downstairs. Decide which shoes are likely to be the most comfortable to wear that day. Change over any insoles as necessary. Gather bag. Pack spare disposable mask. Check Disabled parking bag is in the bag. Take glasses off and position mask adjusting nose wire for comfort and elastic around ears. Glasses back on. Glasses back on and demist as many times as necessary. Head out the door. Back in the door. Collect walking stick. Back out of the door and start journey."

Also currently staff at and Wellbeing Community Hub Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Health means to me the status of being fit and well, or possibly of moving toward that. Wellbeing means to me more esoteric striving towards contentment, quelling of anxiety, prioritising things which are good for the soul or the spirit. A healthy body: . Fit . Young . Able . Thin . Regimented. The person that comes to mind when I think of a healthy body is a sort of aryan, smiling person, white skinned and blonde haired and with no extra flesh, no strangeness, perhaps no personality. The sort of person who would be a cheerleader in an American film. Kind of vacuous but smiling, always smiling, with bouncing hair. If it was a man they’d be gay and muscular, the woman would be adoring, either of them would go out with someone called Brad or Chad or something. Identity My experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by my identity. I was a fat kid and am a fat adult. This was always blamed on some deficiency, rather than a natural aspect of my gene expression (which seems more likely, looking at my family). I would be belittled in PE class and started skiving off to avoid it at middle school (around age 12). Any part of showing my body made me fair game for bullies. When I was a kid I used to love cycling and do it a lot. People don’t get time to comment on your body as you whizz past them. More recently bikes fall apart when I try to ride them. I’m 17 stone or thereabouts. There are plenty of people who are my weight, and we’re told we should be exercising, so why aren’t bikes and exercise machines built to take our weight? Anyway, I was very unhappy as a teen and lost a lot of weight, also becoming a goth. So far as I could see, goths didn’t exercise (although later I had a boyfriend who was a skater goth, which was weird!). A couple of years ago I joined a local gym. I was so scared to go that it had taken me that many years to join. I was terrified to go in, but glad that I did because nobody mentioned a thing, it was fine. As for wellbeing, my dad was a buddhist, so I came across meditation early, although I found it quite dull. I myself was a pagan as a young adult and so didmeditation with others. I enjoyed it, but I won’t generally put myself forward for anything I feel like others will be looking at me and judging me at. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I remember my parents had a book of exercises -Canadian airforce I think, I did those when I was really hating on my body, and lots of running on the spot in my bedroom. Earlier my mother gave me a keep fit album for my tenth Christmas, which was kinda crap of her. We had gone to a lodgers keep fit classes before that, but that was to support her, rather than health. Wellbeing I think I learned about from conversations at the buddhist commune my dad took us to. I don’t remember ourparents talking to us about health or wellbeing, although I do remember my mother praising my brother for wanting to keep fit by playing tennis with his friends. Key moments I remember a girl at middle school getting boobs ahead of everyone else and everyone talking about her, how the showers were supervised by a teacher who pointed out armpit hair and the like. I did not want my body to be subject to the gaze of others. My first period started when I was off school with tummy ache. I now suspect my mother must have known, I knew when my daughter was going to start. I remember the humiliation of starting when I was wearing the wrong day of the week pants. I told my mother and she told the neighbour and I was mortified. I remember my dad wouldn’t buy me pads and only sluts used tampons according to what people said in my school. My dad said that men didn’t buy things like that. One time I started at his house and my brother said he’d go because my dad wouldn’t.I remember a boy at middle school’s voice breaking while he was doing the assembly and everyone laughing at him. I went with my mum to buy my first bra, I don’t remember it being a big deal, but I took one to my dad’s house to wear for school and it caused me to come out in an itchy rash. Obviously I couldn’t talk to dad about it, but I talkedto mum when I was back at her house and we had to change our detergent, I’m not sure why it caused such a reaction though -something the shop had coated it with or just me being stressed? I remember my mum making a big fuss about my brother shaving. Actually she was passing remarks to my fifteen year old son last time we saw her, saying he should shave. I feel I’m a lotlessjudgey than my mum, although I judge her for being judgemental. My son doesn’t need to shave if he doesn’t want to, and he doesn’t want to.Other people’s mother’s have told my daughter that she should shave her oxters! I found that stunning, and told them to back the fuck off, and they laughed and said that all that feminist nonsense wasn’t suitable for young girls. What the actual fuck? My daughter didn’t want to shave her oxters before that point. Now she does. I feel she’s been worn down by daft bitches.Health, wellbeing and appearance Health and wellbeing might be somewhat related to external appearance, although I know you can be fitand fat, it’s bloody hard to be. That said, being unfit seems to be a stick to beat people with in our society and that to me seems ableist, and classist. Have I been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Of course! I live in this society. I spend my life fighting against these ideals and failing. I dislike myself vehemently for not conforming to these ideals even while I say the ideals are nonsense. I have a friend with multiple disabilities who fell down the stairs and did herself many harms. Now she has a massive scar seaming her face, as well as being fat and having an electric wheelchair. The first time I saw her I felt scared, which isn’t fair, but we all internalise these associations of ugliness and evil.She gets prescribedmakeup to cover the scar, that’s how important beauty isto our society. But to be honest, her only child has grown and left home now, if I was in her shoes I think I would have killed myself. It’s a terrible thing to admit, but I don’t think I could get through the days.My parents are of course influenced by these ideals too. My mother doesn’teat carbs until she’shad a few drinks, in an effort to stay slim.It works. She goes on holiday and tops up her tan. That works too. My dad, whenever he speaks of a woman, starts off by telling me whether he finds her attractive or not. Last time I spoke to him he was talking about Olivia Colman. He doesn’tfind her attractive. I told him I don’t think she cares what he thinks, but I guess it constantly being the first thing has made me really consider it. I would hate to not have access to makeup and hairdye. I tried to stop dying my hair when lockdown started, and managed for months, all my dye faded and my hair was a drab beigy grey. It was so nice when I got given some purple dye from a friend to colour it. I guess if I was on a desert island I could live without dying my hair, and without many other things, but I would like to keep a good eyeliner. Getting ready to leave the house My mother would put her hair up before she went to work, twisting it up into a chignon and putting a comb in to keep it in place. If she was going out she’d put on a bit of lippy and some eyeshadow. She wasn’t very good at it, she hardly ever wore / wears makeup. My dad would put on his jacket, check he’sgot his keys and walk out. If I’m going to work I’ll make sure my hair is not too frizzy, sometimes I put it up,tonight I’m going to wash it ready for work tomorrow. I will wear BB cream, eyeliner, sometimes some eyeshadow and always earrings. I usually do my eyebrows too, so that they better match my hair. I do the same kind of thing if I’m going out. Although I hardly ever go out. If I’mdoing a poetry reading I get my nails done with shellac beforehand, something dark. I make sure my hair is good and definitely wear makeup. I have certain clothes which are my poet clothes -they’re more expensive and more voluminous. It’s freaking terrifying being on stage in the first seconds, I find it easier if I get into a fabulous poet character. This hasn’t changed much.

Currently staff at Community Hub. Health Physical We’ve had runny noses, I’m finally beginning to think I must have some sensitivity to pollen because what else could it be? It’s not going away. I’ve always put it down to spring colds before. My daughter seemed to get a sickness bug, although where from I don’t know. She is general quite anxious, and I wondered if that played into it, particularly as it came at the beginning of the new term (of homeschool) which is always a difficult time for her. Mental I had a period of feeling pretty down when the lockdown started. I was dismayed at being so powerless in the face of things, and feeling like my employer wasn’t concerned about my safety. I had a little while of not wanting to get out of bed, but a neighbour noticed and made me up a care package and reached out to me, really sweetly, and that made me feel like people did care. I talked to people at work about how I was feeling and that helped too -nothing much changed, but it was good to know that other people were feeling similarly powerless and just doing what they could, and also my colleague pointed out things that I did well and that really helped. Me speaking up about how I was feeling ended up leading to a workplace where we all spoke up. It’s been weird. I’m not working with any of my former colleagues, although I’m in the same place. I miss the regular library stuff! All the kids have periods of anxiety (especially my youngest (9) who has developed a morbid fear of dying and is often needing a lot of extra support. We have all been grumpy sometimes, and we’ve all found ways of carving out our own space. Often for us that means going on screens, and I think that’s OK. I’m a bit worried about my husband who has been very angry lately. He had a month during which he couldn’t work, and he really stepped up to help the kids with their schoolwork. He did great, although he does have a tendency to micromanage! Anyway, last week he finally got his secure computer set up so he can work, and he’s really fed up about it. I don’t think it seems to him like there’s much point in anything he can do, mainly because he can’t do much while he’s at home. I can hear his frustration in his very loud phone calls, and he keeps on shouting at inanimate objects, and at us. He is sleeping badly, but he often sleeps badly, usually of course, we all get a break from each other. The Government To be honest, I thought that the herd immunity thing was quite sensible. I had an argument with a friend about it. She has health issues, and she felt like the Tories were just trying to kill off the sick and the old. I might have agreed with her that they’d be happy to have a bunch of sick people killed off, but it’s the old people that vote for them! Anyway, I could understand the decision to delay lockdown, and it has resulted in more deaths, but I can’t see that the deaths are going to stop when lockdown ends, we just need to keep them as low as possible, and keep working on treatments and hopefully immunisation. What will they do next? I think there’s an app in the offing that will trace who we come in contact with. Obviously there are lots of people who will feel that that breaches their liberty and lots of people who don’t have the tech savvy to use an app. I see there are loads of jobs associated with this, but I don’t know what they’ll look like yet. I think things will open up but in a different way. So much is going to be different. I hope that the government will no longer be able to rest so much on capitalism, which is failing all of us. I hope that they continue giving people decent financial help and that this leads to a universal basic income, also I hope that the way we work will change so more people can be based at home. In the next year or so I imagine there will be a lot of change, distressing change, I can’t imagine how schools are going to work with social distancing, I guess we will find new normals, and I guess like with a baby that everytime we think we’ve got it it’ll change again. We’re kind of used to things always changing at work now. I hope the libraries open up again. Hopefully we’ll have to live like this for a year or so and then we’ll find a vaccine. Hopefully the governments will not follow this avenue they seem to be latching on to of blaming people, and will take the opportunity to make massive changes to improve our society for everyone. It’s a shame there’s a Tory government, but that’s what we’ve got. News I’m getting my news through what Google feels the need to tell me, what I’m told through my work, Simple Politics on Instagram, and I check the Scottish stats daily on an article in The Courier (which is for the East of Scotland, but the stats cover the whole country). I use that article because it’s updated daily and is very clear about what could be improved about the stats. I haven’t watched daily Government briefings at 5pm. I thought the daily briefings were at 2pm? I have no problem with access to the news, except there is too much of it, I’ve stopped listening to podcasts on the coronavirus, it just stresses me out and there’s no point in that. You mentioned a petition for a sign language interpreter. It is beyond my ken why the English government wouldn’t have such a simple thing, but they do seem to be biased against people who aren’t rich white men so that might explain that. I’m sorry, but the English government doesn’t seem especially relevant to me. Hopefully the elections will go ahead as planned and we will be able to move on with independence. Work and home life The library has obviously closed to the public. One of my colleagues was in the process of leaving to go somewhere else, but she had been waiting on a start date, now she’s just been sent home and told to take her stuff. I guess I won’t work with her again. Another colleague has asthma. I was at work with her when we all got told to immediately report if we had any health conditions. I didn’t. She was having to fill out forms about her health. I’ve not seen or heard from her since. I guess she’s at home. Since the library closed it re-opened, although not to the public. It’s now a community hub. People call us if they need help with anything during the coronavirus ‘situation’, and we do various things to help out. We get a lot of random nonsense calls, which we’ve always had at the library. People basically asking us to google things for them. As library staff I’ve always just done that. That’s part of what we’re for. However now we have more phone lines and more staff. I’m not working with any of my old colleagues, but more senior staff from across the council who do stuff around communities and schools. If they answer the phone to one of the old dears asking something random they tell them to google it and then laugh at them when they’ve put the phone down. I guess that helps them look after each other, and they’re not used to public facing roles. I’m used to just doing eye rolls to the wall, lol. A lot of what we do is helping people who are poor or self-isolating and so have trouble getting access to food or medicines. Here in Largs we have lots of wonderful volunteers, who are actually organised by Miss 9’s teacher, who has really stepped up in the situation. If someone needs some shopping picked up, or some medicine getting we pass their details on to the volunteer coordinators who get it sorted out. We’ve managed to arrange fresh food deliveries to the island of Cumbrae with the help of a minister and the ferry people (not the company, the people), we’ve made sure that all the people who got free school meals now get at least the equivalent in food delivered. We also have free food deliveries for people who are self isolating, shielding (that’s when they have a condition which means their doctor says they should stay at home and not go out for three months), or who are struggling. We have a mini food bank too, so that we can get emergency supplies to people while they’re waiting for other things to get into place. Yesterday I helped a family with four kids to get sorted for regular supplies and got them an emergency drop of provisions including nappies. I’m also using the counselling training I did many years ago when I worked at a university, helping people to calm down and feel listened to. Lots of people are just scared and overwhelmed. At home we’re homeschooling. The big kids are pretty good at getting on with it. This morning they’re particularly motivated as it’s the last day of S1 & S3 for them. Miss 12 is just doing the last check ins with teachers now. She started early this morning to get schoolwork done. Mr 14 is already getting a ramping up of work, but this is his last day of doing languages, and he’s delighted about that! Miss 9 needs a lot of attention and is feeling pretty rubbish about school work. She’s very clingy and is sitting next to me now. She’s on BBC Bitesize now because I was getting really annoyed with her, and I love how the BBC have gameified learning so she doesn’t really feel she’s doing work. This morning she’s done art, hairdressing (on me), and checked in with her teachers. She’s also found out how to extract DNA from strawberries (thanks Glasgow Science Centre)! We haven’t had much contact with friends, mostly, although K--has been chatting with his friends a lot, us not so much. Me and the kids are all hanging out (quietly) together. Technology I’ve learned to use Zoom lately -I used it a lot early on in the lockdown for the Stay at Home Literary Festival. We had a few trolls, but it was mostly fine (although one of the poets got upset because of some racist trolling). Usually at work I’d do writing workshops and the like so I’ve been trying to do those online, in keeping with the rules I have to follow for work, which are annoying. I’ve done one of these just as a video to the computer camera, and others I’ve used iMovie, which has involved lots of going to and fro between my computer and work’s really annoying ipad, which is not up to date and I’m not allowed to update. I swear, sometimes the security rules make things so much worse. I’ve also (for work) being doing iDEA training courses, which are incredibly boring. K-- has been using Zoom to talk to his family a lot. I find it somewhat tedious. They are nice enough but I don’t get the in jokes. I’ve been using WhatsApp video calls to speak to my siblings, especially since my brother’s job was under threat. That has been nice. You get to really speak to them, connect better. I do feel like a teenager though! I’ve been using Instagram quite a lot (and Facebook and Twitter too, but mostly Insta). During April I shared a poem a day. I’ve stepped back from that a bit now. I think I need to stop being so outward looking. Shopping and Food. We haven’t tried to buy groceries online because there’s a big waiting list and there are so many people who actually need to do online shops. You have to factor in a lot of time for a shop these days and the First Minister says you should wear a mask (although I feel ridiculous, so although I’ve made masks and taken them with me I haven’t worn one yet. You have to queue to get into the shop and then when you’re in there’s a lot of waiting for people to finish looking at things, and having old men either push past you or barrel into you while they completely neglect to respect social distancing. It’s not just me being sexist, my husband agrees it’s old men who are hopeless at it. I am really bored of making food. K--is doing a lot of it, and so am I but it’s so boring. I really miss eating out. Neither of us want to go to the shops for the most part (although I volunteered to drive to Irvine to pick up his parents shopping for them -a big long drive by myself with my music? Get in!) so we leave it as long as we can to see who buckles first. He’s very controlling about how and where I should get shopping, which I try to just ignore, but it’s hard work. Also, when he’s making tea he’ll make a big fuss about how he’s going to do it and then ask me what he should make and what should go with it. He is old enough to work it out for himself! I mean, if he can’t be bothered to work out what to make why say he’s going to make it? We did get fish and chips on Sunday, but we’d had to book that in a five minute slot on Monday morning. I say we -I asked everyone what they wanted, and then booked it and then they changed their minds when it was too late, and then K--pulled a strop about how he just wouldn’t eat any of it so I had to get in touch with the manager to find out all the ingredients of the batter. Also I had to go pick it up, with my daughter because K--had gone out at the precise time on Sunday. Tbh I am beginning to see why I’m bored of cooking. K-- is being a dick. Entertainment and leisure Through April I’ve written a poem a day, I’m not sure if that counts as leisure, except I don’t get paid for it, but I’ve got a poetry book coming out in a couple of weeks so I wanted to get some poetical attention in the lead up to that! I’ve been watching things on BBC iplayer (Noughts & Crosses, Normal People), which I didn’t before, and prioritising taking breaks for myself seeing as I’m not getting breaks. I think this is good. It shows the kids that I deserve a break too. We have all been spending time on our separate screens. K--is learning programming, my son has set up his own Minecraft server to do a project with his cousin, and my daughters are enjoying playing and watching TV (YouTube for kids and Netflix) on their tablets. I know Miss 9 is watching Free Rein, Miss 12 watched a French film on YouTube for French and has watched a few more that came up. Mr 14 is watching the first series of Stranger Things with me in the evenings. In addition there have been things online which would have been physical events before. Because I never know when K-- is actually going to be here and he has a tendency to go out when I’m supposed to be going out, I hardly ever get to go to any literary events, and I’ve loved being able to go to loads from the comfort of my desk. If he insists that I don’t do that right now I can listen on a surreptitious earbud and make sure my video is off! It has been amazing to be able to talk with some of my inspirations, and I feel my poetry has benefitted. There’s another literary festival this weekend, so hopefully I’ll get to do that too. Personal hygiene We have to wash our hands when we come in from daily exercise or anything else. This is tedious and exacerbates my eczema. When I get to work I have to wash my hands, I also clean all the door handles after everyone’s come in, wipe down all the workstations (before they get there or while they’re faffing), and I have to wear gloves all day. When I’m preparing food parcels I wear gloves and an apron and it’s really hot. I wash all my clothes every time I get back from the hub. They’re sweaty but it’s not just that. Because we’re always in, and the cleaners aren’t coming any more we always seem to be cleaning. We get the kids to do some, but I’ve cleaned the kitchen twice already today and I’ll be cleaning it again before the day’s done. My hair is growing out somewhat. I actually do have hair dye, but I’m not sure I want to use it or just grow it out. My neighbour, who cares a lot about appearances, is distraught because she has her hair dyed two different colours by her hairdresser and now she’s got grey roots. I offered her my hair dye but she doesn’t want to mess up the hairdresser’s hard work. Hairdressers have killed my hair so many times I’m wondering if it’s not a good thing we’re having to do it ourselves. Sleep I’m doing fine with sleep. My husband is not, but he never sleeps well. Actually he sleeps OK, but whenever he wakes up instead of going back to sleep he throws a strop about waking up and looks at his phone. He will not countenance not doing this stupid activity. Miss 9 is also getting very stressed out and having trouble sleeping sometimes, I’m trying to counter that by making sure to spend a long time with her in the evening calming her down and trying to get her to bed earlier than K--says she should go. A lot of it is down to her being so tired that every little thing gets monstrous in her mind. I haven’t had any interesting dreams, sorry!"

Wellbeing – whilst partially concerned with physical health – feels like a less corporeal concept. The first five words I think of when I imagine a healthy body are: strong, fit, muscular, happy, and robust. Having grown up in a community of rotund farmers, I’m very much aware that health does not equal thin, in terms of body image. Often that’s quite the opposite. Health, for me, is very much tied up in fitness, in the outdoors and fresh air. It consists of hearty meals and flushed cheeks – all very Enid Blyton stories. Identity I think that my idea of what constitutes a healthy body has changed over the years. Growing up, it was very much as I described above, but as I reached my adolescence, outside influences very much took over and – like my peers – I began to try and achieve the very thin bodies which were prevalent in fashion and advertising during the 1990s and early 2000s. As I’ve grown older and my sphere of influence has altered, I’ve sort of reverted back to my original thoughts regarding health and my body. I would rather feed myself good, wholesome foods and spend my time exercising than I would participate in diet culture, even if the later doesn’t result in the type of physique I’ve always been told is beautiful. I’ve mentioned before that my children have/are undergoing a diagnosis for autism, but I believe that this has been especially influential in regards to my own identity in the past few years. I strongly suspect that I am autistic – I met a great number of the criteria of my eldest child’s diagnosis. Since I began reading works by autistic writers, and watching autistic content creators, I’ve come to a better understanding of myself. I wish I’d had these tools for self-knowledge years ago. I didn’t know how to read myself, and I didn’t see enough models of relationships that weren’t heterosexual whilst growing up that it took until long after I was married to realise that I’m actually bisexual/pansexual. And coming to terms with the fact that my monogamous partnership means that I won’t necessarily be able to explore that side of my sexuality hasn’t been easy.  I do think that my parents’ attitudes to homosexuality – which weren’t overtly hostile, but weren’t exactly supportive either – definitely influenced my view of myself growing up. I very much pushed aside feelings and thoughts which didn’t align with the expected heterosexual relationships I was expected to cultivate. I mentioned in part one of this directive that my parents came from a very working class background, and I do believe that they had a very specific lifestyle in mind for me, as I was growing up. It was well-meant, but very much not me. Had I known these things about myself earlier, I think I would have been a far happier, far healthier individual. I know that at least one particularly bad bout of depression could have been avoided, and a good few friendships – which, hindsight tells me were thwarted romantic attempts – might have blossomed into something more, or been salvaged for what they were. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I first became aware of needing to look after myself at the point between primary and secondary school. I made the transition between systems in 1997, and it felt as though we were bombarded in that final year with All The Information about sex and drugs. I believe that it was thought that if we learned all this before we went into secondary school that we would be prepared for the types of socialising there, but it was too much at once. I remember feeling as though I was entering a lions’ den after my rural, country school. I think the way that my own children are being taught is far better – sex education begins in their earliest years and ideas regarding consent and healthy relationships are drip fed through the curriculum. The same is true about drugs – primary school tackling cigarettes, alcohol, and prescription medicine. Up until secondary school, what I learned about health was done vicariously through the world around me – Sesame Street, the food my mum made, the people in my life, and the way I felt in the fresh air. I didn’t ever feel like my well-being was anyone’s responsibility, which is the privilege of someone whose wellbeing is protected. My mum and dad were always rather blunt when it came to questions about sex – they answered honestly but were never forthcoming and tended to speak in metaphors. “Don’t go paddling without your wellies,” was frequently yelled by my mum when I went to parties with friends, whilst, “You breed it, you feed it,” was my dad’s favourite addition. I learned a lot from magazines, which wasn’t particularly healthy given our teenage propensity for reading things intended for fully-grown women. Cosmopolitan was a common source of information, but so were the boys we spent time with – their own source being the fledgling world of internet porn. We learned largely by doing – eating fad diets at lunch times when we could control our own food, and by fumbling around with the boys we were ‘dating’. I’m not sure I’d recommend such a piecemeal approach, but I soon learned that I like eating far more than I like being thin (not that I’m ‘fat’ at a 12, but this was the 90s…), and I like sex far more when I’ve been with someone long enough to trust them and for them to learn how my body works. I found the pop-culture staple of one-night-stands were largely unsatisfying and it wasn’t a lesson that took me long to learn. Key moments I remember my first period – my mum was away on a trip with the school she worked at. Panicked, because of the aforementioned deluge of information which concluded my primary education, I was convinced that the anaemic discharge of said first period was a vaginal infection. My nan was looking after my brother and I while my mum was away and I didn’t dare tell her because I was ashamed – she was my idol. About twenty minutes after my mum returned, I cornered her and made her look at the marks in my pants. She was dismissive – appearing bored – and simply said, “What? It’s your period. What did you think it would look like?” That was an interesting question – I’d been told I’d bleed, but never how much. The lack of drama involved was something of an anti-climax and I didn’t really know at the time how to deal with the very nonplussed reaction. The rest of puberty seemed to happen in the space of around a month and a half afterwards – though was probably longer! I was nearing my 14th birthday when I got my first period, and by the time I was a few months into my 14th year, I was already wearing the size of bra I still use now. I still have t-shirts and sweaters from this time which fit today. To be honest, my experience of puberty was baffling. It happened so quickly that I didn’t really have time to take it all in. If I’m honest, there are aspects – such as my sexuality that I mentioned above – which I’m still trying to sort my way through. Growing older Until I started reading magazines that were much too old for me, I didn’t really do anything specific to maintain my health, and even then, it wasn’t so much my health that I was maintaining but a super-thin waist. I worked in a dog kennel over the weekends from the age of 13 and sort of subconsciously decided that since I was outside all the time, walking dogs, that I didn’t need to think about things like ‘health’. The first few years after university, in which I suddenly had access to my own car for the first time, was when I started considering my fitness seriously. Now that walking wasn’t my job or primary mode of transportation, I started to feel increasingly unfit and resolved to do something about it. I initially started by taking up yoga classes when we lived near Cambridge, but when we moved to the North East of Scotland, there didn’t seem to be too many available. I now try and walk the dog regularly (my husband getting up before me so doing most of the morning walks alone), and prior to the pandemic, I was volunteering at my local library so would walk to the local village – about an hour away – as a way to exercise. In the first lockdown, I really enjoyed participating in the Joe Wicks exercises but as they’re no longer live, I’ve fallen into the trap of ‘the videos are online, I’ll do one later’. I try to listen to my body and – trite as it sounds – my heart, these days. If I feel unfit when walking up the hill, I try to work more walking into my life – parking as far from the supermarket as I can, for example, or (virus allowing), arriving at school early and taking a walk alone before collecting my children. Or staying for a walk after I’ve collected them. And when I feel low, I know I need to begin cutting my time online. I’ve deleted my Facebook account – a birthday present to myself in 2018, which is possibly the best decision I’ve made in recent years. I’ve also not touched Twitter since the start of December – it’s now mid-January – and that seems to be helping. I feel like my bubble of “anti-Brexit, anti-Tory, climate-crisis” feeds is just too full of jeopardy to be healthy in any sustained way. I also try and seek out literature and crafts which assuage my sense of powerlessness. The Craftivist Collective, the book ‘Factfulness’ by Hans Rosling, and anything by Jack Monroe has been a massive relief through all of this.  Like everyone, I think, I’d like to believe that I’m going to stay healthy. I like to think that the things I’m doing now will carry me fit-and-well into old age. Whether or not that’s the case remains to be seen – I might have drawn a genetic short straw and be predisposed to cancer, or have a weak heart which hasn’t yet been discovered. Or any other number of things. For the most part, I’m happy just continuing to listen to my body and my soul, and see where that takes me. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think that at various points in time, different physical appearances have been attached to the idea of health. In times gone by, when food was scarcer than it is now, carrying a little extra weight was perceived as healthy. Now, as obesity comes to signify poor health, we perceive thinner bodies as being better looked after. As I touched on above, I wanted to fit in during my teenage years. I wanted to be like the other girls in whatever way I was able – recognising what I now know to be autistic traits as peculiar, following the trend of my adolescence for dieting was a way to fit in. I tried to make myself ‘thin’ to be accepted, but not for any of the usual reasons. My one ‘vanity’ – my Desert Island item – isn’t so much of a cosmetic thing to me, though it’s often classed as one. My contact lenses help a lot with sensory issues – the feeling of wearing glasses constantly is a real drain. I also worry about having to drive in glasses, due to the fact that my vision is so bad that anything viewed out with the frame might as well be seen through a cloud of Vaseline. The thought of missing something to the side of me really fills me with dread. Getting ready to leave the house I remember my mum and dad would get up before we did as children. My mum – without fail – stood at the living room window every morning so that when my dad reversed around the corner and out of the drive, she could wave at him. When we were up in time, we would join her in waving at the window. My mum worked lunch times at a school in the next village over, so we would usually leave the house before she did, or she would leave at the same time as us. It was rare that there was no one there when we arrived home, something I’m increasingly thankful for as I get older. I actually hate leaving my house. I love being out, but the act of stepping through the door really stresses me out. My husband calls it the ‘doorstep mile’ though I don’t know if this is a recognised phrase or not. I have a little checklist in my head – ‘phone, purse, keys’, which has been added to over the years. It now includes ‘mask’, but in the past has featured things like ‘baby’ and ‘passport’.

Wellbeing means being healthy, happy and satisfied with life. A healthy body makes me think of someone fit, strong, agile, energetic and mentally alert. Identity I think that my own experience of health has been influenced by education and gender. Being female means there are so many reproductive organs to go awry.  Social class will have played a part inasmuch as it affects good housing, good diet, the good or bad influences of family and friends. My husband and I have been faithful partners for 59 years so there has never been a worry of picking up sexual diseases. We have never been part of the permissive society of the 60’s. I saw the effects of that on the children I taught. Growing up and learning about health and well being My mother and I lived alone through the war so she had the main influence on me. She listened to the Radio Doctor. We would do exercise together such as standing tall like a tree and touching toes. She gave me cod liver oil and malt throughout the winter and I wore long socks and a liberty bodice. We used to get cod liver oil and orange juice from the clinic and I had a bottle of milk at school. She loved eating greens and cooked every day. She used to grow runner beans, potatoes and tomatoes and put eggs in isinglass to preserve them. I inherited her Kilner jars and still use them. I didn’t like school dinners and would usually cycle the 3miles home and eat a cooked meal with my mother and father. Every year she would make jam and bottle apples, tomatoes, any fruit she could get. We went regularly to the dentist. When I was young you had to pay the doctor and my parents were members of the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows who provided sick pay and benevolent grants. My mother was more health conscious the older she got. She would eat honey, yogurt, fresh eggs and anything green because she thought it was good for her. She sprinkled Bemax on her pies. No-one else in the family did but now I am old I find I do the same. Some of her phrases have been with me all my life. Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back. Friday night is Syrup of Figs night. Gargle with Sanitas after cleaning your teeth. Don’t go outside after a hot bath. Don’t go swimming after a meal. An apple a day keep the doctor away. Put a saucepan out to catch rainwater to wash your face. It’s good for your skin. We had health education in the third year of my grammar school. It was also part of the examined course at my teacher training college. We had to study Education and Health by Gamlin. I still have that book. I read books from the health section of the library and magazines. Now I use the Internet for information on specific health problems. When I was 21 I read a book about the benefits of apple cider vinegar. I don’t like instant coffee so at playtime when the staff had coffee I would have a mug of apple cider vinegar in hot water.  They all hated the smell of it but it’s supposed to prevent arthritis and now 60 years later they have pains that I don ‘t suffer from it but still daily drink my home made apple cider vinegar. Another book that has influenced me has been about natural beauty products. I try to use my own, made from garden plants such as marigolds and rose water. I add essential oils to my own marigold oil to make essential oil remedies for all the family. No L7594 Female age 82 Married 59 years Benfleet Essex Retired Infants Teacher and Ofsted Nursery Inspector For my families’ wellbeing my husband grows our fruit and vegetables. I freeze or bottle, make jams and chutneys, make elderflower and elderberry syrup and cook our meals from scratch. We don’t drink alcohol. My daughters lead the same life style and we are all healthy. Key Moments I can’t remember much about it. I was a small child so a late developer as far as wearing a bra and periods were concerned. I suppose they are important moments but I can’t say it meant anything special to me. Just something that I knew would happen. Growing older I can remember looking at old people when I was a teenager and thinking that I didn’t ever want to be old. I started going to yoga when I was 30 and have kept it up ever since. I think it is important to keep mobile. I used to do PE with my class daily joining them with skipping 100 steps. When I retired I joined a Keep Fit class and have only stopped because of the Covid lockdown but will return to that. I do yoga classes on Zoom. I wear a Fit Bit and try to do 10.000 steps a day. My husband and I go for a walk, about 3 miles, every day. I continue to get health books from the library, read newspaper and magazine articles and use the Internet. I am more aware of the parts of my body that ache sometimes. I get more muscular pain especially when doing something different. I expect to get less mobile as I get older but am doing my best to resist it. Health, wellbeing and appearance. I think appearance is very much associated with health and wellbeing. If you are in the correct attire for what you are doing it gives you confidence and you will be more accepted by the social group you are with. It is important to be dressed correctly for various types of weather. I think good posture is connected to health and wellbeing. Also taking good general care of yourself. When I was a teenager it was the accepted ideal to have a 36 inch bust, 24 inch waist 36 inch hips. I used to strive to have a smaller waist. It was the days of support underwear, thankfully long past. The film stars of the 30’s probably had an influence on my mother. She was quite glamourous and well dressed and corseted. I have learnt to do without any of the things that become unavailable. I think it’s silly to think of them as life threatening.  A Desert Island item might be a pair of tweezers but I would need a mirror with them.  Getting ready to leave the house. My father had his own plumbing and heating business. He always shaved every morning, had a short haircut and wore clean overalls and a collar and tie. He was concerned about the state of his hands and would smother them in Swarfega. My mother would take a long time preparing to go out of an evening. She wore powder and lipstick but eyeshadow wasn’t really in vogue. She would put Vaseline on her brows and lashes. She went to the hairdressers weekly and had one perm after another all her life. She had a good head of thick dark hair. If it was an evening dinner and dance she would start with a beaten egg white on her face. She also put strips of cucumber on her face whenever she sliced one. She was proud of her figure and wore Spirella corsets. I have been with her when they were being fitted. When they went out in evening dress they were a very handsome couple and greatly admired. I wear much less make up now I am old. I use face cream made from my daughter’s beeswax. Just powder and light lipstick and mascara. I go to the hairdressers weekly and like to have longer hair that can be turned into a variety of styles. In my youth it would take me a while to get ready but now it’s very quick. I do have a facial, massage and pedicure every 3 months when Covid permits."

Two words that conjure up different parts of the body. The health, the body as such and the wellbeing, well, your brain I guess. Healthy bodies have meant different things over the years. Years ago, we didn’t really think about it too much. It was more a case of if you were fat, you weren’t healthy but if you were slim, didn’t smoke etc then you were. In the 80s growing up and throughout generations even now I guess, if your parents can’t afford to feed you the so called healthy food then you won’t get it. When we were kids, yes we had veg but food was home cooked or whatever you’re mum had in the cupboard. It wasn’t always the healthiest food. My mum grew up on bread and jam and not a lot else. Her siblings suffered with their teeth because of it. However, my Nanhadnomoney,shesimplycouldn’taffordit.Rationingwasalsostillonforsomeyearssothefoodwasn’t available. Even now, if you were to do two trolleys. Fill one with frozen convenience meals and the other with all the ingredients to make the same meals. Which one will cost more? The second one that’s the one. Where’s the incentive to try and cook from scratch when it costs you double? A lot of houses either don’t have the time or just don’t have the money to fill their trolley with fresh food. It may be unhealthy but if it means that the kids eat then so be it. Ask most parents. All they want for their kids is for them to be fed and happy and healthy. But when you ask them what they mean by healthy, we mostly mean that we don’t want the kids to have any nasty diseases / cancer etc. we don’t mean that we want them to have a BMI of minus 6. Nowadays healthy bodies means a whole host of things.from people going to the gym to work out, not smoking, suddenly becoming vegan, juicing, taking 6000 vitamin pills a day. All ridiculous really. You can get hit by a bus later on in the day. Each to their own I say Ive tried all the stupid diets. I lost a couple of stone on slimming world. Put it all back on and more now though. Lost nothing on slim fast bar the will to live. Lost nothing on the eggs and grapefruit diet, nothing on slimming pills etc etc. A lot of it I guess is just down to cutting out the shit and moving your arse around more. P3373 I used to be a bit of a bean pole. A 5 ft. tall bean pole but I was an 8 to 10. I used to do a lot of dancing several times a week which kept me fit. Then the old bones started to grate, ligaments stretched. Then having a baby knackered the hips up even more and so now on doctors advice, Ive had to give up the high impact stuff I used to do. Can’t do yoga or Pilates etc as “you are stretching the ligaments that are already overstretched” (diagnosed with hypermobility – osteo arthritis and fibromyalgia) so now im 5 ft., in my words chunky (size large 14) and not happy with it. Im not over eating. only have 3 meals a day and don’t buy cakes or biccies etc. don’t smoke etc. so god knows. No im not running 10 miles a day. Would you consider me unhealthy??? Probably. However, I never fry food. Rarely have take out . Don’t smoke. Drink in moderation. Run around after the dogandkids,always cleaning thehouse andgenerallydon’tstop. So maybe imactuallyquite healthy. Idon’t know. How do you quantify health??? As for wellbeing. I always see that as being your mental state. All of a sudden we are being taught “mindfulness “ and living “ in the moment” twenty years ago if you were living in the moment and feeling the world around you then you were either considered a hippy or irresponsible. Now you are basically encouraged to do it I guess though a lot of it IS in the mind. Healthy mind healthy body eh?? If you’re going to be a morose moaning old hag, then your bodies going to reflect it. I guess you’re going to be depressed, sluggish etc. you’ll certainly depress everyone else so that’s not healthy. A lot of things are positive thought. Ive now got to the point in life where I just need to feel content with myself. Im 46 for god’s sake. Im menopausal. Got droopy tits, a cake shelf belly and chunky thunder thighs. Im no longer a 20 something size 8 with pert little 32 b boobies, cute little ass etc. who am I trying to kid? The only fellas im going to attract now is going to be the ones over 40-50-60. Im not going to attract 20 yr. olds so why should I pressure myself. I need to live the age I am. Not that I mean to act like a little old lady cos I don’t feel that I am one. I just need to have the acceptance that people change, your body changes, your personality changes. Im a completely different person to the one I was 25 yrs. ago. Why should I feel guilty for eating a slice of pizza or cake? Why should I die hungry?? It’s always constant pressure when you diet or whatever you want to call it. You feel awful and regretful when you eat “something you shouldn’t “and although you feel good and “what a good girl I am “because you can count your daily calories on one hand you are also left with the feeling of deprivation when you see the rest of the family in a restaurant enjoying their burger or steak followed by apple pie and all you’ve had is a glass of water and a bowl of salad leaves. Die happy and full. Don’t die hungry. Maybe healthy body does mean having a healthier mind-set. Maybe one assists the other. Accept that you are who you are, you aren’t going to be the person you were all those years ago. I’ll get off my soap box now"

It’s so sad the way that it’s affected so many people. Thank god that so far, it hasn’t affected anyone in my family. We are all ok. Ive been fine. Im currently working from home / juggling that with home schooling and keeping the housework done. And do you know something? Im absolutely loving it. Im sooooooo chilled. I get up, get my son up. He sets up doing his school work at the dining table. I sit in the living room doing my work. Ill intersperse this with a bit of housework when I start to get fed up and that’s that. I don’t want to have to go back to work however they will want me back at some point. Shame. Ive never used Skype or Microsoft teams so much. In fact, I’d never heard of Microsoft teams before the lockdown. Now Im on such meetings every week. Its fine actually. It’s quite nice to have a chat to people and see them through the screen. My workload is so much easier to get through not having constant interruptions in work though. It’s great. Our household has been pretty chilled. We are still all getting on. None of us has buried the other under the patio and we haven’t had one decent row which im sure is rare in most households. Initially our son had a meltdown when he saw the amount of schoolwork that the school sent him. He couldn’t understand how he was expected to do work that they haven’t yet covered in school. I had to try and explain that the school didn’t know how long they would be off. Of course it hadn’t been covered yet, they couldn’t see into the future and that it was a case of using technology more to find out what was needed. The school are in regular contact. The kids have access to teacher’s emails. Google is great to assist them in finding out info and in all honesty his school couldn’t do anymore. They even have staff on board to speak to kids who are struggling with stress or can’t cope. Don’t know about the mothers though…. Maybe theres free access to gin. !!! I’ll have to look into that. I don’t want my son to go back to school as yet though they’ve been off since March. It’s now June. Im happy for him to stay off until the September term is due to start. What’s the point in going back for a few weeks? It’s so much safer for them to stay at home safe for a few more weeks a couple of children over in England have already contracted it this past week after their schools went back. if you are wary of reopening shops and bars / restaurants etc, then why are you happy to send children back when you know that they won’t social distance, they will gather closely together. You are basically treating them as guinea pigs. Sorry, however this mother doesn’t want her child to be a human guinea pig I’d like to be able to go out and have a coffee or something though. Apart from that though, im fine. theres so many people moaning about it though saying that we shouldn’t be made to stay at home, it’s against human rights etc. for god’s sake, you are being asked to be sensible. Stay at home. Don’t pass a deadly virus around by going out and about as usual. (For most unemployed lazy buggers it won’t make any difference. They have been practising for years). We aren’t being bombed out of our homes. We aren’t being rationed. We don’t have to send our children away to strangers etc. It’s not like living through a war. It’s for a couple of months. Not 5 yrs. People haven’t got a clue. People are so bloody selfish nowadays. How WOULD they cope if it was WW3? I dread to think Im a bit dubious about the government decisions at the moment. Is he having a breakdown? He was late putting lockdown in. then late with the procedures of how to deal with those breaching the lockdown. Then Boris was really ill himself. But then when he came back, he was all for reopening everything. Hang on a minute, you nearly died. Your girlfriend was about to drop a baby, then she showed signs of it and yet you then wanted life to get back to normal??? Is he having a breakdown?? God knows what’s going on. This is the new normal for a while though. If it means that we have to wear face masks when out and about shopping etc, in parks etc or that there are less tables in bars and restaurants so that tables are away from each other for a while then so be it. At least they can start to re-open and get some money in. I don’t think anyone would mind having to wear a mask out in public for a few months if it meant getting back to some normality Obviously, you can’t eat with a mask on. But the staff can have theirs on and as long as you are 6 ft. away from the next table while you eat, it shouldn’t be a problem. We are due to have our marriage blessed in September. I know its still 10 weeks away and im being selfish but I really don’t want to cancel it. Theres only 16 of us. Im hoping it can still go ahead. England is ahead of wales at the moment. They are opening. It’s happening in England. If they want the 16 of us to wear masks during the service, that’s fine. As long as I can take it off outside for a couple of photos and then put it back on. I just don’t want to reschedule it as I know so many others who have had to. I’ve been trying to not watch the news to be honest. It’s too depressing. I don’t want a daily update of deaths. I get so confused with what you can and can’t do. Just decide what and can’t be done, announce it on a pre-organised time and day so everyone can be made aware and leave it at that. Ive got too much else to do than sit watching the TV for updates. Family and friends have taken to either face timing or whatsapping. It’s good. On a Saturday, we’ve invented the “polcon arms “which is our virtual pub. We and our mates decide what time to be ready and then we all log on, with our booze and chat the night away. 4 or 5 hrs. Later, all suitably pissed, we all log off and go to bed. No taxis, no pub prices, can go to the fridge to get munchies when you want. Bloody ideal. You can even do it in your Jim jams. Even my parents whatsapp our son every week to speak to him. They would never have done that before. They didn’t know how to. The only thing I do find stressful is the weekly shop at the moment. Luckily I shop at aldi and as they have their “ all day every day “ preference for emergency services, I don’t have to cue as I can flash the warrant card and go straight in. however, although im quite used to the social distancing In the shop, with the 2 metre squares, a lot aren’t. So many times Ive been heard to say “for F**ks sake Mrs, get out my square “as some silly cow reaches across me to grab a bunch of bananas. Oh it really winds me up. Or you get the peruses. The ones who going shopping is their weekly highlight. So they just stand there and look at the shelves, for ages, then move 2 ft. to the left and do the same. Then again. You are waiting for them to move on so you can move on but no. then they walk on without choosing anything. Stop dawdling, get in, and get out. That’s my motto. Then I had the row with the fella last week who didn’t think I should be allowed in with my warrant card if I wasn’t in work!!! I therefore told him in front of the queue which made him look like a dick that “if I was in work, then I wouldn’t be here trying to do my weekly shop would I dickhead?? “. Honestly some people. Can you imagine if I’d gone in in uniform? Parked up in full police car, blue lights going with a shopping trolley to do a full shop. Oh sorry not just a full shop, a shop also for my parents as they are isolating due to health issues. Trying to separate two lots of shopping in one trolley and going from two separate lists as you move your way along the 2mtr squares is a nightmare I can tell you. But sorry, next time, I’ll do it in full uniform rather than in shorts shall I?? That’s the only thing that’s really winding me up, stupid people! What I can’t understand is those who aren’t getting dressed though or keeping up with hygiene. What so because you aren’t going out in public as such, that means that you don’t need to wash / brush your teeth / do your hair or dress?? Ok, so we all need a good hair colour. Embrace the grey …not. Thank god for amazon prime for both hair colour and gin. I still get dressed, brush my teeth etc even if im not leaving the house. I always have. It’s like my mum said at the beginning of this, “to get dressed makes you feel better. It makes you feel more normal. “Ive always been brought up to come downstairs once dressed. I never do anything otherwise. Apart from Xmas day. That’s the exception. I will, allow myself to open pressies in my jammies. That’s because I may have new Xmas clothes. I can then dress in them for the day and have a new outfit on in time to cook Xmas dinner. Yay. That’s the only time though. Even if I don’t feel well, I still get dressed and go downstairs, even if I end up ill and going back to bed. At least I’ve made the effort. The only difference during lockdown is, im not wearing my magnetic eyelashes ( my natural ones are weak and fall out so I look like an alien ) or draw on / fill in my eyebrows ( my eyebrows have a light tattooing, same reason as the lashes, they fell out ). AND wait for it…. Im not always wearing a bra shock horror. These bad boys are rocking and rolling in my tops, in a bid for freedom. Hey im not going anywhere. The furthest I’ve gone is the back garden. Who needs to sit in a sweaty bra in the sun? Although I was embarrassed when an incident happened in the street which brought all the residents out. I went out to sort it out and came back in realising my girls had been bouncing around in my top free as a bird. Oh god, I hope no one noticed. It wasn’t cold out there I don’t think! Sleep wise im fine. A lot of people are saying that they aren’t sleeping properly possibly due to the stress of it all. Fortunately for me, that doesn’t seem to be an issue. I can sleep anywhere, anytime, standing up, laying down. No strange dreams other than the normal crap. Ive not really been affected in this way. I know my mum has though but then shes never been a great sleeper. I don’t know why it’s affecting so many like this. I think I’ve got to the point that I can’t change anything. Im doing what I can to stay and keep myself and family safe and therefore im not pondering on it too much. Theres no point in worrying about things either you can’t change or that have already happened. A few years ago I wouldn’t have been able to say that. I was one of those who worried if they didn’t have anything to worry about. Now I just can’t be arsed. It’s too much, it gives me a headache"

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Direc,ve, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but par,cularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Health I think means to be well physically without disease.  Wellbeing means feeling good about yourself. I think you can have either separately or both together. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. clean, slim, fresh faced, pure, exercise Is there a par=cular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person.  I just did a Google search for a suitable picture and there are hundreds of lycra glad, smiling, slim toned creatures to chose from! Iden,ty How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orienta=on? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your iden=ty at all? A lot of my friends have got the fitness bug where they are addicted to exercise.  I like to think I am stronger than that, but really I have never been tempted.  There is so many other things that I would rather do. I did like getting fitter in the first lock down but we have a puppy now so walks are not hard exercise.  I am not a natural mover and until I had children I ddin’t really have to think to hard about staying slim. My mother was a dietician so taught us to eat the right things.  So, I think that by virtue of my being a white, middle class, straight female has influenced my view that healthy is slim and fit.  All media I watch reinforces that and so has my education-both  personal and institutional.   However I accept I can not be considered slim and fit at this point and therfore this has a negative impact on my wellbeing  Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing MARRIED MARLOW, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WIFE & MOTHER When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I think I have always been aware of the importance of being healthy but wellbeing feels a recent concept.  Or something that we now verbalise regularly but I don’t remember anyone talking about wellbeing in that holistic way.  Who had responsibility for looking aSer your health and wellbeing when you were younger? I guess my parents.  I went to boarding school so my teachers or myself?  I don’t think wellbeing was really an issue.  But we had a different life which was less pressurised and freer than it is now-even before covid 19.  Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversa=ons take place? Being healthy was really about eating well, my mother always cooked everything, we didn’t really have sweets very much.  Interestingly we lived in the Middle East for a bit and we had loads of coke and fanta and orange Tang and my sister and I had hundred of fillings.  My children don’t have any at all! Did you receive any educa=on about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? We were definitely told to be outside and exercise-play games/ sports. Not smoke and drink or take drugs. But there was certainly not the obsession with how you look that exists now because of social media.  We had Just 17 once a week but we were only interested in the pin ups!  I think it is very different now and it is of no surprise to me that so many young girls and boys have eating disorders.  We have become soooo narcissistic and there is almost no escape from it.  Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I went to boarding school soon after I had turned 11 so I was quite a way behind some of the girls turing 12 and so I really found out about the changes with all the girls at school and it was really nice to share the horrors and hilarity of it. We were quite horrified by pubic hair and tried to cut it off and taught each other how to put in tampons.  My period started on holiday when I was at home, I guess I was 13 /14 and it was still such a tremendous shock to me!   Are there any moments or rituals that you think are par=cularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? I don’t remember many other moments apart from getting my first period.  In general I found it a distressing time because there wasn’t an awful lot of information around.  Now there are books and we are more open about things. I remember the excruciating conversation or one way talk my mother had with me about periods and sex.  I think I am already having period conversations MARRIED MARLOW, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WIFE & MOTHER with my children and referring to sex (we live on a farm) so I hope they will have more background knowledge, but no one can stop the great confusion that hormones make you feel -isolated, alone etc.  apart from making sure they know that is normal… How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to ac=vely maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a par=cular event in your life? As I mentioned earlier I am not a perfect healthy specimen. I used to smoke and drink too much and not do very much exercise.  In my 20s I did yoga for a few years and loved it but that kind of stopped.  Then I used to walk a lot. I never had a problem with my weight until I had children and then nothing shifted.  I had started to shift it in the first lock down to my children’s delight!  But it has crept back up in the last couple of months and I recognise how doing regular exercise helped me a lot in the fist lock down and I think I should try and do more than the dog walks, but when? Where do you get informa=on about health and wellbeing now? You can’t escape it can you.  What I find is there is a lot of dubious information bandied about by people which I know is incorrect but is accepted as true and accurate-but that is the same for all information in this internet age. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? Having children makes you more aware of your body and what it can do.  In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I think we definitely are trying to be healthier due to covid and recognise that being healthy is important for your wellbeing generally. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? I think they go hand in hand but not necessarily Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I think it would be hard not too.  Received ideas of beauty are quite pervasive but so is the idea that we should be more open to ideas of beauty, which I think we try to but it is very hard not to think that dress would look much better if I was slimmer and taller (and 20 years younger)! MARRIED MARLOW, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WIFE & MOTHER Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? No, my parents were not hung up on this stuff at all,  they were interested in having a good and interesting time.  They are lucky to be so long lived!  But they are very careful about what they eat. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I guess face cream is the only thing I use every day that is a beauty product.  Perfume and mascara would be a luxury. Ge[ng ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father geXng ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? I don’t really remember my father getting ready he would appear dressed and looking smart and my mother would do tie/ cravat/ bow tie.  For her there was the dressing, the shoes, contact lenses, jewellery, make up, and lastly masses of perfume. It was always fun. What is your own rou=ne when geXng ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this rou=ne changed over =me? I don’t really have a routine but it is a long the lines above.  The children find it a bit disconcerting when I wear full make up as I don’t wear it very much.  And I don’t think they can remember it happening for a while!  It hasn’t changed a lot."

Wellbeing is the mental ability to be able to think clearly to reason, consider and decide activities to maintain myself, loved ones and society in general. “A healthy body” suggests: Fitness – Trimness – Attractiveness – Functional – There is no one individual who represents this image for me. Identity My reactions to being healthy have been influenced by everything and everyone around me in varying ways throughout my life. After all my identity including my experience of health and wellbeing is an accumulation of all the influences that have created the person I now am. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I had no concept of “health” or of “wellbeing” while I was growing up. My parents were responsible for ensuring as far as possible that I was not ill and that I returned to being well if I became sick. I have no recollection of anyone talking about “health” only how to keep myself well and fit. Such conversations simply occurred in the course of ordinary life to address specific occurrences. There was never any reference to what my parents would have referred to as “mental problems”. Similarly in school there was no direct reference to health only to maintaining our physical safety and fitness by way of PE and Games. M6756 Male 70 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance Key moments As an adolescent I was never aware of changes regarding puberty. There were never any particular moments I can remember just a gradual acceptance of manhood. Having had daughters I believe that the physical changes at puberty are much more pronounced for girls and they do need more understanding and guidance. Growing older Throughout my life I have struggled with my weight and have tried all sorts of diets and physical exercise to reduce my size and feel fitter. None of these were successful in achieving my aims. However more recently my Partner introduced me to Slimming World and as a result I have reduced my weight to a level acceptable to me while improving my fitness. Following my Brain Haemorrhage in 2002 the resulting Brain Damage has affected my thinking and emotions. As a result of great efforts I have learnt to control my reactions better and continue to function well under most conditions. Health and wellbeing information is predominantly acquired from my Partner and Daughters. I am more aware of my body now than I have ever been before and am much care fuller to maintain what I feel is a healthy balance. Equally due to my experiences I am now very conscious of my thought processes and emotions (both of which on occasions I have to work hard to control!) There appears to be no need to make any major changes in my approach to health and wellbeing other than those brought on by increasing old age (which are preferable to the alternative!) M6756 Male 70 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance Health, wellbeing and appearance I believe that people’s appearance invariably reflects their unwellness both physically and mentally. Yes like the vast majority of people I have been influenced by societies ideals and images. It is a normal reaction to wish to look and feel able to attract mates to reproduce. My parents were influenced by exactly the same kinds of ideals. Beauty products are more about monetary profits than any real advantages and good food provides all that we need to be physically healthy. My Desert Island item would be my Family Photos. Getting ready to leave the house My father was immaculate even as a Chimney Sweep! He always shaved every day and dressed smartly with a collar and tie. There are very few memories of him not having a tie on on any occasion outside the home. Having spent my working life in formal professional organisations I was happy to be seen in 3-piece suit, collar and tie. In fact I found it quite difficult to adapt to “dress-down Fridays”! It was also a problem for me mentally to adapt to less formal clothes after my Brain Haemorrhage. Socialising is more comfortable for me if wearing a collar and tie including any formal occasion requiring Dinner Suits! Even now I feel better wearing a collar and tie and do so regularly to feel comfortable."

I have continued to suffer short periods of instability but they result from my pre-existing condition. My emotions have been subject to short periods of extremes but again these are ongoing and not caused by the current situation. Government Given the unprecedented situation I believe that the Government has done it’s best to protect and support the population, maintain health services and minimise the effect on the economy. With hindsight the timing of actions could have been different with only limited variation in the outcomes. Lifting the “lockdown” must not be rushed and hopefully the Government will not give in to the attitudes of self-serving minorities who would endanger us all. Boris Johnson has shown a more Statesman like approach than I believed he would and has provided greater leadership and confidence than a majority of our politicians. Opposition Parties (supported by the media) create illusory problems for their own ends rather than support decisive constructive approaches. News Gleaned from Local and National Radio, BBC Reporting and to a lesser extent news reporting on the Internet. I have watched most of the Daily Briefings. Have in the main provided dependable information and gave confidence that the situation was being well handled. The Scientific and Medical Advisors have consistently presented a competent and knowledgeable attitude. Some of the Government Spokesmen are confident and present themselves well (eg Matt Hancock; Dominic Raab) but unfortunately one or two others are clearly out of their depth and struggling. I haven’t had any problems with access to the news. M6756 Male 69 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance The use of BSL Interpreters is not necessary and would simply provide further distraction and confusion. There is already extensive use of sub-titles which are as easily seen as BSL Interpretation and actually contribute to the information supply rather than detracting from it. Work & home life Having Retired on ill-health grounds almost 20 years ago and as a result of living most of that time alone there has been little change. Technology I was already to using Skype and WhatsApp on a daily basis and have now also used Microsoft Teams, FaceTime and Zoom to keep in touch with family and to maintain contact with others ie Tai Chi and Exercise I have also deliberately telephoned people I would be seeing regularly normally and others who I haven’t been in contact with for too long a time. Social media platforms I consider to be anathema to real life contacts and degrading. I therefore have as little to do with them as possible. Shopping & Food There have been no changes to my diet but the enforcement of “social distancing” rules has in fact made supermarket shopping much more enjoyable ie less people and ease of finding items Entertainment & Leisure Increased time spent on my Allotment has been rewarding both physically and mentally TV broadcasting has continued in the main to provide the same rubbish that has been dominate for some time. Have increased time listening to Radio programmes especially Plays and traditional comedies. Also listened to my music more than I have for many years.. I have taken the opportunity to review my will, investments, bank accounts and to sort through lots of old paperwork, photos, family items etc and decide what to keep and what to discard. Started an on-line Course to learn to Draw better. Reading as much as ever and in particular: Jane Eyre, Tale of Two Cities, Sherlock Holmes, Book of Nothing, Children of Time and various Science Fiction and my usual Magazines: Focus, Freemasonry Today, Banking World and RHS. M6756 Male 69 Living Separately Bideford Retired Finance Not swimming daily, attending Freemasonic Meetings or seeing friends. I have taken time to consider how I spend my time normally and start to decide how I will do so in future. Personal Hygiene My handwashing has increased substantially and not swimming daily are the only changes. I have had a beard all of my adult life but it and my hair are the longest they have been for more than twenty years! I am seriously considering keeping the length and style of my hair and beard longer and different than I have done previously! Sleep There haven’t been any changes in my normal sleep patterns. At my age it is unusual to sleep through the night without “having to answer the call of nature” more than once. It is also necessary for me to rest most afternoons."

Having lived alone for the best part of 16 years’ seclusion was not a great problem for me.  Just prior to the lockdown I was due to visit my Partner at her home in Parkstone but by mutual agreement we felt it was safer not to do so.  The immediate effect of the lockdown was to curtail my usual activities which was annoying but was not a problem as I could take my daily exercise working on my allotment and otherwise only going out to do essential shopping. At that stage there was no change in my perception of time. Although as we have progressed it has been a little harder to keep track of days occasionally. I have found that shopping in the evenings is a much pleasanter experience with staff out numbering customers! Checkout operators are also more willing to chat. So that’s a change to my routine I will continue with.  Like many others I spent some time sorting and clearing out my possessions, papers and family records. I have also taken the opportunity to start an on-line course in Drawing (my Partner is an accomplished water colour artist) which has taken up much of my free time and I am finding highly enjoyable.  The time spent on my allotment has resulted in it looking better than it had done for probably five years! There has in addition been a distinct increase in the presence of birds in the vicinity. During the period of the initial lockdown the reduction in traffic and people generally around the town was delightful and very peaceful. Unfortunately, that did not continue once the lockdown started to be eased and it has now caused me to feel uncomfortable with numbers of people around me.  As lockdown has eased I have started to visit and see various friends again. Also my Daughters and Granddaughters were able to visit me to celebrate my 70th Birthday which was particularly enjoyable. Otherwise as I do not believe it is yet safe I have made a conscious decision not to return to my previous activities until probably 2021 and possibly not even then!     Homelife In some ways having lived on my own for so long my routines have changed little: I tend not to get up early to go swimming but mealtimes and other routines have remained much the same.  Currently I do not foresee any changes to my present patterns of life.  Media and technology The use of Zoom to stay in touch with my Daughters and Granddaughters (living in Solihull and Oxford) has certainly helped to alleviate feelings of loss and remoteness. My Partner and I had been using Skype daily to stay in touch for a long time previously.  I have tried Zoom for Tai Chi, U3A, CHSW, Exercise and Freemasonry but other than the later have found the results indifferent at best.  Having used a Diary all of my adult life I have continued to refer to it with a lot less relevance in the current situation. I do continue to write my Journal daily as I have done since my Brain Haemorrhage 18 years ago!  My previous reluctance to use GP Appointments/Prescriptions on-line and internet Banking have been offset by experience and I will be maintaining it in future.  Waiting My usual pattern of life would be to visit my Daughters, Granddaughters and Partner at least every couple of months. This has not been possible and I feel that as my families’ safety is paramount its unlikely to happen very soon.  Although I took the opportunity to allow my hair to grow longer than in recent times I was glad to get it tidied up when my hairdresser reopened. Dentist and optician appointments have been put off but are currently no problem. Medical appointments have easily been combined.  On the very few occasions there was a queue outside a shop I needed to visit I simply walked away and went back later. My thinking was that if there was a queue the numbers inside the shop would be more than what I would feel was comfortable. In addition, I now feel less inclined to browse anywhere."

My life is completely turned around, I am fearful of the future and I don’t think we are out of the woods by a long way. Health I probably had Covid right back at the start of April. It wasn’t very bad, just five days of cough, feeling hot, swollen glands and generally off colour. I didn’t need medical help and just got on with it. Then a few days later I had some sort of relapse with difficulty in taking a deep breath and rang the doctor. You get telephone consultations now and diagnosis by magic without being seen. I was told that I was on day 12 and it was a common occurrence, take paracetamol and if it gets worse ring again but he thought in a couple of days I would improve. When you live alone and have no support network it is difficult being unwell but I had to get on with it and accept medical advice. Another fortnight down the line I rang back as I wasn’t much better. This time he felt he should see me but that wasn’t straightforward. As the surgery is closed, I had to drive to a different clinic and wait in the car. I was fetched by a different doctor in a sort of spaceman outfit of full PPE and taken into what I could only describe as a cell. After various checks I was given a prescription for antibiotics, told it was probably a secondary bacterial infection and to have a chest x-ray and blood tests. I wasn’t offered a test for Covid 19. The chest x-ray meant a trip to the hospital on another day, a radiographer in PPE and answering a whole barrage of questions before I was even buzzed inside the building. The next day I had to go out yet again to get blood tests. I had to drive to the surgery which is closed to the public, park in the staff car park and stay in the car having previously given them details of my car. Two nurses appeared outside in full PPE and I had to sit in the car while they took the blood. When you don’t feel well all these excursions are very tiring and unsettling. The next day I was telephoned by the original doctor to say everything has come back clear and I should be very reassured by that. The diagnosis is post viral fatigue with no treatment other than paracetamol, breathing exercises and gradual recovery. They are getting many cases of people like me so I am told. I haven’t had a Covid test so still don’t know for sure that was the original virus though they think so. I suppose once we get general antibody testing for everyone I will find out. I am not critical of my experience and I am very grateful for the NHS help but the whole experience is frightening and none of the people I met had any feel for how it is when you are coping completely alone. I am one of so many. As for emotions, I think I have coped amazingly well really. I have lived alone for many years and used to solitude so that wasn’t new for me. What did change though was my whole social life ended one afternoon and since then I haven’t so much as shared a cup of tea with anyone since that date in March. I have followed the government advice, stayed at home, some exercise when I’ve felt like it and a shopping trip once a week through necessity. It has been up to me to find ways of coping and I have but this has been going on for many weeks now with no end date. The Government I support what they have done and appreciate their daily broadcasts with the medical experts. Everyone is stepping into the dark and nobody truly knows what is right and what isn’t. I think we have an open democracy and I trust they are acting in my best interests. Everyone is an expert in hindsight but it is incredibly tough for those making the decisions and I pray for them each day. Looking ahead, I expect the Secretary of State for health will be made a scapegoat and shunted off out of the cabinet. I think the Chancellor will be forced to put up taxes, both direct and indirect ones, to pay for the cost of the furloughs and business loans, and then ultimately he will be replaced before the next election. As for Boris, well we have to wait and see but I think he has shaped up well and tried to give us real leadership. We are going to be poorer as a country for a long time but what alternative is there? News Each day I watch the government daily update around 5pm and think that is a brilliant way of keeping us in touch. It is depressing the hear the death totals and at the time of writing we are currently around 33000. I knew one of them well so when they say each day about how each death is mourned by someone I can identify with that. I like the way the media can ask the experts difficult questions and they stand up well. I think the way they have developed all the different graphs and charts has been good too. They aren’t treating us like children, we do understand how serious it is and I think open information means more people will undertake the lockdown restrictions more strictly. You will never reach some people who think they are above the law, don’t think it will happen to them and basically don’t care I ration my news coverage as you could be glued all day long otherwise. I generally hear the local radio news early in the morning, wait until the 5pm slot, watch the 6.30 regional TV news and then either the BBC or ITV late evening news at 10 pm. I suppose there should be BSL interpreters available for all the main news but maybe that could be just via the news channel. I find it distracting from the main speaker when someone at the side is making exaggerated facial expressions and hand gestures. If I was deaf, I would probably think very differently though and I realise we need to get information out to the widest audience. I wonder how people where English is not their first language are faring and how much they understand about it all. There must be a lot of very scared, confused people out there. I am just imagining a deaf, elderly person on their own with limited English and how are they coping. Work and home life I am retired and I thank God that I am. I would be desperate if I was having to go to work still or not able to do my job. To have money worries as well as health issues would be terrifying and I am grateful not to be in that situation. I have neighbours around me who are on furlough. I think the women have coped better and I’ve yet to see any of them out on skateboards as the men are. The men are restless and want to work again but we aren’t quite there yet. Some run restaurants and they really fear that they won’t be able to open up again despite the money coming in from the government at present. There are a couple of families home schooling and the novelty has definitely worn off for the parents. One family can’t wait to send the children back but another plans to keep the children at home until September. Such difficult decisions for them all. I live alone so have no one around me. I was touched when a couple of neighbours that I hardly know passed their telephone numbers to me for emergencies. It was very kind and if I was desperate, I suppose I would ring. Since then I have had no contact with them though and if I was being cynical it feels like they’ve done their bit. Technology I keep in touch with my closest older friends by phone as none of them have computers. The computer has been my lifeline and I use email a lot to friends and some cousins abroad plus WhatsApp and Messenger. I didn’t know what Zoom was until lockdown but love it. I have been able to join in leisure classes held on Zoom and stay in touch with the real world. I realised I would be very much on my own in all of this so decided to ring a few elderly friends around that I might bump into only now and then. Interestingly, though they love to chat when I ring them, they have yet to ring me back. I use Facebook but rarely post myself. I follow several interest groups on it plus our local town page and that is very informative. I’ve found some funny sites on facebook and enjoy them. My favourite is the bin isolation group that began in Australia where people dress up in all sorts of costumes just to take their bins out. It lightens up each day to see what people around the world are up to and a good laugh doesn’t do anyone any harm. I dip in and out of social media and don’t let it rule me. Shopping and food If I could get online home delivery slots, I would use them. I’ve only managed to get one so far and that was 9 pm at night. I am forced to go to the supermarket and limit myself to one trip a week. The only thing I am having trouble buying is flour so am having to buy cakes instead of making my own at present. I had stocked up very well on everything that would keep in the way of food and household products before the Brexit scares back in the Autumn so am working my way through some of that and it definitely reduced the pressure of having to find items such as toilet rolls back at the start of lockdown. I would say my eating habits are much the same in that I am used to cooking from scratch and eating sensibly. What has changed is that I haven’t been out for a coffee, to a café or a restaurant since just before the start of lockdown so have made absolutely everything for myself. Coming up to 200 meals on my own now! Entertainment and Leisure I am in charge of my own daily routine. If you live alone and run a house properly, cook, clean, maintain the garden etc then that actually takes up quite a proportion of time. I make a point of some form of exercise each day and it varies from gardening, indoor cycling or going for a walk depending on how I feel. I only go out at quiet times and then to an area of open moorland in walking distance where it is virtually deserted. I have spent more time gardening than last year though I’ve only achieved about the same but done it at a slower pace. I was used to going to art classes and they stopped initially. In recent weeks they have reappeared as YouTube videos and interesting to watch but there is no interaction so not the same. I have discovered the WEA (Workers Educational Association) online free Zoom classes though and can’t praise them enough. They have been my salvation really as you get to interact with the tutor and other likeminded people. I’ve done various crafts, singing and quizzes. The crafts are my favourite and I’ve learnt felt and fabric flower making, needle felting, papier mache and printing. Each one has been fun and to find fun activities is so important. I plan to continue with paid Zoom craft classes when they are rolled out in the Autumn as I don’t think I will feel confident going out for some time. I spend much of my free time doing my own crafts of sewing in various forms and knitting. I’ve also pursued my interest in family history and done plenty of research. Some of the research sites have been free in this time and I have been able to explore the National Archive. I’ve dipped into some of the Museum sites that are giving free tours as well on line. I’ve turned out a few cupboards, sorted summer clothes and moved a few things around in the shed but they don’t exactly count as leisure. I watch the TV but choose what I view rather than just letting programmes role on. I record things I like to watch later and also view a number of things on the catch-up service. I listen to the local BBC radio station when I am doing housework or quiet things as it is great company. I’ve also listened to more of my CDs and become quite addicted to the wonderful music that Andre Rieu plays as it is so soothing and uplifting. I thought I would get into reading more books but that hasn’t happened yet. Instead I continue to read a daily paper but now digitally rather than the paper copy I always used to fetch. I already had three different magazines a month delivered by post and have continued to enjoy those. I find plenty to do, don’t get bored and choose to organise my time so I don’t feel alone. I relish solitude and know the true difference between that and loneliness. Personal hygiene I can’t think that anything has changed here really. I am certainly missing having my haircut every six weeks though but accept that a longer style at present is what everyone alone is having to put up with. Judging by some of the home haircuts I am seeing, then growing your hair is no bad thing and I am going to resist getting the scissors out. Sleep I don’t sleep brilliantly at the best of times and am used to long hours of being awake in the night. I don’t put the radio on in case I hit upon some depressing news. It is hard to keep the worries away sometimes but you have to accept it is part of the pattern of life at present and get on with it. I generally make a cup of tea, look out at the stars for a bit, read a magazine until I am sleepy and then settle down again. They tell us this is a once in a lifetime event. In the second world war they had deprivations and dangers of a different kind. I’ve read that all we have to do is stay at home so I am doing my bit and doing it as cheerfully and positively as I possibly can."

Wirral Retired Civil Servant Everyday Health and Wellbeing My health and well-being is very important to me, I think that it’s importance was communicated to me at a very young age by my Mum, less in words more in actions, everyday we were given cod over oil, malt extract and orange juice. Even though we were a large, low income family our meals consisted of fresh ingredients cooked each day, my Mum knew what was needed to help keep us healthy and it worked as we were rarely ill. I’m still influenced by her ideas that a healthy varied diet and fresh air are essential to keep fit and healthy and this I have in turn passed onto my children. Take-aways, processed foods and fizzy drinks are far from the norm in our households and I still take supplements each day. Health to me means not having any life limiting conditions, especially self inflicted ones due to lifestyle. Although my Mum was proactive concerning our health, our wellbeing was a different matter. We grew up in a household that was volatile, and at times very dysfunctional, my parents were not well suited and I remember rows and violence for the best part of growing up. My Dad was a seafarer so it was a relief when he returned to the sea.  I was an anxious child and thought that if I pleased my Mum she would like me more, I suppose I felt in some way responsible for their rows, as an adult I realised it wasn’t me, but it did lead to feelings of inadequacy and feeling I was never being able to be quite good enough for my Mum. Bodies were something to be hidden as well as natural bodily functions, so nothing was ever discussed, if I asked a question it was treated with disgust. I think that this had a negative impact on my life as I’m not that comfortable with my body. There wasn’t much information readily available for girls like me when I was growing up in the fifties and sixties. A key and unwelcome moment for me was when I started developing breasts, which I took to hiding under baggy tops, my Mum must have noticed as one day she handed me a bra, just that no help or advice, everything seemed cloaked in mystery. I don’t remember any sex education or discussions in school, as our school was run by nuns, I suppose that this isn’t surprising. When I started my periods at 13 I remember being too scared to tell my Mum at first. When I did tell her she sent me to the chemist with a note and a carrier bag and handed me a contraption to keep the towel in place, no explanation just a terse ‘don’t bring trouble to my door’ I didn’t know what she meant, I thought that I had done something wrong. I had heard whispered conversations in the  school playground but some of it seemed just too bizarre to be believed. I don’t think that I ever got over the feeling of periods somehow being dirty rather than a natural part of growing up. I did wish at times that I had born a boy as my brothers seemed to have an easier and freer life than me. I’ve always been interested in my appearance, partly to help cover my feelings never being quite good enough, instilled in me by my Mum from an early age. I think that led to me never leaving the house with first showering, washing my hair and applying makeup, like a mask to hide behind really. My daily rituals start with a shower and hair styling, then applying make up and a spray of perfume, ready to face the world, even if I’m not going out. I’m also a people pleaser, which I wish I wasn’t, which I think is a result of my upbringing. I find that I put others needs before my own, a habit I can’t break without feeling guilty and mean. R7226 I think that I am influenced in part by popular ideas of beauty and physical appearance, although at times it seems that there is an unhealthy emphasis on ideas of just what is acceptable in terms of looks and the perfect body, I think that this is mainly the result of the growing influence of social media. I’m relieved that it didn’t exist when I was young. I follow fashion up to a point, but I know what is age appropriate, I don’t like to stand out but I do like to be presentable. I am sometimes influenced by new beauty products especially skin care, but I would never spend large amounts of money on them. If I was being cast off on to a desert island I think I would choose to take sun tan lotion as I’d want to look after my skin, but I like to smell nice so my favourite perfume would also be a consideration. Since COVID I have relaxed a bit and I’ve even been out with less than perfect hair. I think that this is in part due to having to were a mask outdoors and in shops. I’m hoping that I continue to be more relaxed about my appearance once lockdown is over, but I know at some point I will go back to the idea that I have to present a perfect picture to the world. I think if you look the best you feel good, but I’m not that keen on the changes growing older brings, I wish I had appreciated  my younger self more. My Dad always dressed well and had good taste, my Mum was far less interested in how she looked. My parents rarely went out together as my Mum was not keen on socialising with anyone outside of her own parents and siblings. I don’t visit my GP surgery often but when I do I pick up leaflets on health, I watch TV programmes about health issues and read items that interest me in the press, but I don’t over worry about my health as I feel healthy, but if I detected anything amiss I would seek advice. I am quite private so I don’t like to talk about my health and the most boring conversations to be had are when people discuss their illnesses past or present every time you meet them. It’s not that I’m unsympathetic, I will listen to and help anyone, I just think that some things don’t need repeating on a regular basis. I am interested in health and I am a participant in the BioBank, the One Million Women Study and the Predict PD Study as I’m interested in research which may help people now and in the future. As I age I think keeping healthy is increasingly important to me, even before the shock of COVID 19 and the devastating effect it has had worldwide. I look after myself as I do not want to be incapacitated in anyway and be dependent on others. I want to continue living a healthy active life for as long as I can. I am more cautious now when tackling heavy work, but only because I don’t want to injure myself, at my age I think prevention is better than cure. I walk each day for a minimum of four kilometres, some days it’s much more. I’m not keen on the gym so I volunteer a few days a week in a local park and a rather overgrown cemetery, which is now designated a memorial garden. This involves doing quite heavy and demanding gardening, I think that being involved in this work adds to my feelings of wellbeing. To me there is nothing better than being out of doors with like minded people doing something useful in the local community. But I also have other interests to keep my mind active, including visiting galleries and museums, walking with my friends, holidays and I read at every opportunity. Since lockdown I have started researching local history, I am always busy, but I know the health benefits of relaxation and try to build some quiet time into my day. I put off retiring until I had turned 70 as I had real worries that I would have too much time on my hands, leading to inactivity that would be detrimental to my health and well-being. But I’m surprised at just how many opportunities there are in the local community once you start looking, it’s been my saviour, although COVID 19 has impacted somewhat on the amount of volunteering I can participate in at present. I’ve also made new friends with similar interests to myself, and so R7226 have extended my social circle. It’s so important to me to be able to enjoy life and keep my independence, my family are very important and special to me but the last thing I want is for them to feel duty bound to take care of me. I’d be very uncomfortable with that situation. The words that spring to mind when I think about what makes a healthy body are: fit, healthy, active, slim, diet and mobility. To me Well-being means: family, positivity, security, freedom, friendships and happiness. The person I admire and see as a good role model for women is Joanne Lumley. Who appears to me to be intelligent, confident, curious about the world, interested in people and good causes, brilliant sense of humour and has the wonderful ability to laugh at herself. She seems to be fit and healthy and has clearly looked after herself. Who better to demonstrate what’s possible as you age than Joanne."

Covid 19 (Update) My health is similar to pre Covid 19, both my mental and physical health remains the same. I’m fortunate that I have had no medical issues prior to or during the current crisis. I feel a bit more isolated than usual as I’m keeping my trips out to a minimum, I miss friends and family. I keep in touch by phone and text but it’s just not the same, so some days loneliness hits hard, but as I want to keep save and virus free so this is the price I having to pay. If I’m busy I’m fine, but some days when I wake I think what’s the point, but then I count my blessings. I think that the government appear to be bumbling through this crisis, there appears to be no real plan. They have tried to ensure people get financial help, which is good, but there appears to be a lot of people falling through the net. Of course these are unprecedented times but there are some world leaders that are managing the crisis better than ours. I think the lockdown was not implemented early enough, the lack of decision making that allowed 3,000 football fans to travel from Madrid, when no matches were being played in Italy, to watch the match in Liverpool appalled me. I watched them marching through Liverpool City Centre towards Anfield and then back, madness. The government also allowed the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, despite the growing number of Covid 19 cases being reported. No wonder the UK now has the largest number of cases in Europe. Going forward I think and hope that the government will err on the side of caution and ease the lockdown bit by bit to see what impact it has, as I find it worrying that we keep hearing about a second wave. Whatever decisions the government make I think that the economy is going to take decades to recover fully. I tend to watch the BBC news at 6pm, I have watched some of the 5pm press broadcasts, but it’s all getting a bit samey, but I do like hearing what the experts have to say, not so keen on the politicians. I sometimes read the news on Google but with caution. There is so much about Covid 19 on TV that I avoid some programmes, I sometimes feel that if I watched once a week that would be enough. don’t know anyone personally who has problems accessing the news. But I do think Nicola Sturgeon is ahead of the game by including a BSL interpreter when she is delivering her briefings. I would also like to see regular use of sub titles. I’m not sure why the government needs to be petitioned to include a BSL interpreter, maybe one more example of the government’s lack of direction. As I am now retired I’m not affected by the problems that face many working age people. But my home life has been greatly impacted by the lockdown. I feel that like many others I’m sure, that I have lost my freedom, I can’t really make choices, I find living on my own is difficult enough under normal circumstances, but not being able to see my family and friends is awful and I wonder at my age if my life will ever get back to normal. The challenge for me is not to over think the current situation and try to live day by day. I’ve always enjoyed socialising; but I worry that I might become reclusive as I can’t imagine a time when I will feel save travelling on holiday or going on a coach trip to enjoy a walk with the Ramblers. I’m finding just going out to shop or exercise very stressful at present as people don’t always observe social distancing. It never ceases to amaze me that people will queue patiently 2 metres apart outside shops but when they get in its a free for all. I’m not sure I’ll ever feel that comfortable in a crowd again. I used to go out most days, now I find myself thinking of reasons why I should stay indoors. I’m used to computers having used them in my work for decades, I have a laptop and an mini ipad, which I use every day, however I don’t really use social media except for Whatsapp, as the likes of Facebook, Twitter etc. just don’t appeal to me, I prefer to get my news from reliable sources and I’m not really interested in the minutiae of other people’s lives. It seems to me that some people use these platforms to either become famous or keep themselves in the public eye, I think that the lines between public and private life has become blurred, just not my idea of fun. Shopping for me is a nightmare at the moment, I find people don’t keep their distance, some people actually lean over you to reach items, and as I know two people both younger than me, who have died as a result of Covid 19 I must admit I now worry more as it seems to me that becoming infected is much more of a reality, so I am now shopping later in the day, during the quieter times, I also avoid shopping from Friday to Monday. I would say that I am eating more, as in the past I tended to skip lunch if I was out, now I seem to be organising my day around mealtimes. Food isn’t that important to me as it’s not so interesting cooking for one. I’m careful about what I eat, but since lockdown I have developed the bad habit of rewarding myself treats, I think it’s due to boredom and I’m sure I’ve put some weight on. I prefer to be out of doors, so most of my time now is mainly taken up with housework. As I’m a very practical person, in the first three weeks or so I decorated throughout, painting all the woodwork and some of the walls in my flat, that was until I ran out of paint. I also sorted out my cupboards and wardrobes ready for either the charity shop or the tip, luckily I have a garage that I can store the rubbish in for now. I haven’t taken up any new hobbies or learnt new skills, but I have read many of the books I have been promising myself I’d read for ages. I am watching more TV and I’ve watched a few DVDs I’ve had for years, the one I have selected for later is called Sunshine on Leith as it’s billed as a feel fabulous film. I’ve also watched The Merchant of Venice and The Jersey Boys. I’ve also been listening to more music; First Aid Kit Stay Gold, Hayley Westenra Treasure and Roy Hamilton the Definitive ‘50s Singles Collection are my current favourites. At the moment I’m reading The Personal History of Rachel DuPree by Ann Weisgarber. It’s about a woman who married and found herself and her family living in very primitive circumstances in the Badlands of Dakota around the time the first world war was declared in Europe. The family’s living conditions are appalling and the book tells her story, it’s probably a good book to read at the moment, as when I contrast my life against hers I know even in these strange times I’m very fortunate indeed. Sadly my exercise has decreased as I don’t go out anywhere near as much as I used to. But when I do I try to walk at least three miles. My personal hygiene is much the same as before, except now I’m washing my hands far more and I don’t go out without hand gel or wipes. I’m a lot more careful about what I touch now, so I use wipes when I touch communal doors or the bins. Extra precautions don’t bother me as safety is the overriding concern. My biggest bug bear is that I’ve not had my hair done since the lockdown and that does bother me as my roots are showing. I have a root cover spray but I don’t like the feel of it on my hair as it makes it feel as if I’ve got too much gunk on my hair and no matter how often I wash my hair it never feels totally clean once I spray it, call it vanity but I can’t bear to see roots, my hair also needs a good trim, I’m just glad I’m not socialising at present. My sleep pattern has changed since lockdown and I’m actually sleeping better. I’ve always had vivid dream, but I’m having more nightmares at the moment, some even wake me up. They usually involve a childhood family home where I find myself walking through the rooms and somehow I end up on open water either on a boat or more frightening a raft, the water gets increasingly rough and ship horns sound it’s usually at this point I wake up feeling really frightened. I have had this type of nightmare occasionally for years but usually only when I’m stressed. Most of my current dreams involve my family and usually it is when we are all a lot younger. I’ve also dreamt about my late husband a lot more recently, but these are always pleasant dreams. When I wake up after a nightmare I read my book or go on the internet to do my banking until feel tired, as it’s usually around 2 or 3 am, bit too early to get up."

I also wantto staysafe. However I’m not finding it easy as my life has shrunk in a way I’ve never experienced before and it’s taken some time to get used to the new challenges. I think living on my own makes the isolation even more difficult, but I’m using the time to catch up on outstanding jobs such as decorating, clearing out cupboards and getting items together for donating to charity. I’m trying to pace myself so I have something to do most days. Although I live in my own flat, it’s spacious and has a good sized southwest facing balcony overlooking a private garden, so goes some way to compensating for not being able to go out as much as usual. I found it all quite chaotic at first and it took me a week or so to settle in to a routine, shopping was a major disruption, I really couldn’t believe the way some people panic bought everything in sight. Which I think, thanks to excessive media coverage, led to even more people panic buying, leaving the shops empty. At first I found bread and milk hard to come by, but it’s settled down now and I can usually find what I need. I like fresh food and used to shop every three days or so, but now I’m shopping once a week maximum and buying only what I need and as I live on my own that’s not a lot. I‘m batch cooking and freezing, even though I’m not that keen on eating reheated frozen food. A friend of mine told me that a refuse collector she knows said that he couldn’t believe the amount of out of date food being put out in the bins, far more then even after Christmas, disgraceful really, I’m not getting why some people would think food with sell by dates would last indefinitely, crazy behaviour. At least it’s settled down now and the shops generally have more stock. I saw an item on the TV where a woman was boasting about dumping £100 worth of food as it had past it sell by date, and said she’ll continue to buy too much food so as long as the emergency lasts, some people are shameless. But then you get people who are going out and helping their community. Have donated to the local food bank, something I do anyway. I think that some people appeared to find social distancing difficult at first, especially in shops, but things are getting better, but that’s thanks to the shops stepping in and setting rules and putting barriers in place, but it’s still very dependent on the good will of the shoppers. I now look online to check how busy my local supermarket is before I make a decision on the best time to shop to avoid the crowds. I also shop in just one shop now compared to how i used to shop around. I’m aware that there are special times set by for the older and more vulnerable, but I choose to avoid thesetimes, asI don’t want to take unnecessary risks. I’m also very careful in terms of social distancing, I miss my social life and I’m not as active as I was, I’m missing my volunteering work and walking with the Ramblers. I’m also snacking far more than usual, so I’m worried about putting on weight. I’m only wearing cosmetics on the days I don’t go out, a first for me and I’m not dressing in the same way, much more casual. Isolated as I am I’m still not tempted to join social media, so at least I’m avoiding any inappropriate posts, my friends are sending me short videos via  whatsapp, they either funny or whimsical but never about Covid 19. I’ve given up going out each day as the more I learn about the virus the more scared I am of contracting it and I think the NHS staff need us to do as we are advised by government to ease the burden placed on them. I’ve heard people say oh it’s just like flu, well we must be watching different news bulletins as that’s not what I hearing onthe news. I watch BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Chanel 5 news and any of their current affairs programmes, I also tune into Radio 4, as I think that these are all reliable sources, but I limit my viewing as it’s so sad to see the hospital scenes and hear of yet more loss of life. I’m so full of admiration for the NHS. Let’s hope that the prime ministers fulsome praise for the NHS translates into enough PPE and going forward, better funding and pay. I haven’t been ill or had any Covid 19 symptoms. Sadly a neighbour’s daughter, who worked in a pharmacy, contracted Covid 19 and died last Wednesday, she had been ill for just four days. I think the more I learn about the virus the less likely I am to engage in risky behaviour, which just weeks ago, was just normal life. I miss my family and friends but see the importance of socially isolating. I’m washing my hands a lot more than I ever did: I also carry anti bacterial wipes with me all the time. I’m also wiping down everything I touch far more now, I’m carefulabout where I put myhands when I’m out. I now wouldn’t dream of picking up a supermarket basket without a wipe to cover it with. I’ve also stopped usingpublic transport, but I’m fortunate that I stilldrive and I have a car. I have fabric shopping bags and I now wash them every time I use them. My hygiene standards have always been quite high, fussy some would say, so some of the practices we’re being asked to adopt I already do, but this pandemic has raised my hygiene standards to a higher level, one thing I will continue to avoid in the future is using cash unless I really have to. Looking back I think the government was a bit slow to grasp the enormity of the Covid 19 outbreak, I also think from the start we should have been told what to do rather than advised, the evidence of the scale of the outbreak was clear in both China and Italy. It may also have avoided the flack the police are getting whilst trying to implement the guidance, which is really an order. I’m not convinced that the government are showing great leadership during this crisis, but neither are some other world leaders. I think it’s interesting how each countryappears to have managed thepandemic, with Mr Trump, acting like a latter day Emperor Nero, has initially denied there was a problem and then declaring it to be a bacteria, he changes his story almost by the hour. I don’t think he has got to grips with the seriousness of the pandemic. It also seems to me that the USA is not pulling together as a nation, rather that each state is working in different ways and has no real plans in place to stop the virus spreading. I think Germany is dealing with the crisis more effectively. But I’m not sure that all countries are being upfront about their Covid 19 cases, as it appears odd to me that countries with very large populations such as China and USA appear to have a disproportionally small number of cases and deaths compared to the UK, Spain and Italy. I would also prefer to be informed of identified cases and deaths in both numbers and percentages, to better understand the bigger picture I do wonder if the EU will survive this pandemic as it doesn’t appear united, there seems little evidence of the countries pulling together, I think this is a test of just how much cohesion there is in the union. An example of this was the other when the French border guards tried to requisition face masks and hand sanitiser bound for the UK and the NHS as president Macron had ordered that all equipment must stay in France. I think future generations will struggle with the debt that will build up during this crisis, so long term this is looking like a disaster, I fear life will never be the same. The only positives I can see at the moment is the reduction in pollution, traffic and the sunny weather and what appears to me to be the increase in wildlife, it’s so lovely to wake up to the dawn chorus ."

In February New Zealand recorded it´s first case of Covid19. In March the case numbers here started to climb and politicians were talking about ´self­isolating´ and ´social distancing´. On 19 March borders were closed to everyone who was not a resident or citizen and by midnight on 25 March we were at Alert Level 4 (the highest level) of the Covid19 alert system and locked down at home in our 'bubbles'. And so started a very peculiar period that I suspect we will be talking about for the rest of our lives. New Zealand has managed to keep virus case numbers low (around 1,500 with 21 deaths at the time of writing this). We are past the (first?) peak and are in the process of moving down through our Alert Levels.  On 28 April the Alert Level was reduced to 3 and about two weeks after that we moved to Alert Level 2 which is where we are at as I write.  Most people can get back to work and school, although there are restrictions around the sizes of gatherings and behaviour in public spaces. Border controls remain in place, and the Government is scheduled to review restrictions on 25 May (after a couple of weeks at Level 2). My experience over the last 2 or so months has been a mixed bag. Emotions have been up and down. In the beginning I felt very anxious and was waking in the night and not being able to get back to sleep. I was worrying about my parents in the UK and when I might see them again. I was worrying about losing my job and what that would mean for our finances. My partner describes me having a ´meltdown´ as the seriousness of the situation became more apparent. I had strange dreams that I couldn´t exactly remember but that I woke from feeling really stressed. A few weeks into lockdown and on the surface the anxiety levels started reducing - I was adjusting, and we seemed to be getting a handle on the virus in New Zealand, and I had dramatically reduced my News intake so I wasn´t living and breathing Covid the whole time. However both my partner and I still had little outbursts: getting disproportionately annoyed or angry about a tiny thing, or just waking up in a really bad funk that soured the whole day.  There was this kind of adrenalin rush because this dramatic world event was evolving, but at the same time my everyday life was very humdrum and non-dramatic so I felt a disconnect between the level of worry and my experience. My partner was onto the Covid story very early, reading stuff posted on reddit from people around the world who were seeing the virus first hand. There were also disturbing videos on YouTube showing terrible scenes from China of people being dragged from their homes to be quarantined and hospitals overwhelmed and mass graves. At the same time I was reading The Times online (we have a subscription) and The Guardian, and they didn´t seem to have much reporting about Covid (maybe just one article a day). But I was doing a little bit of cover teaching at a language school in January (last year I got an ESOL qualification and have been trying to get a bit of teaching experience) and there was some concern there about students returning from China after the holidays, which made me feel that this event was closer to my life. As the news story and the case numbers started growing around the world it was quite frustrating trying to understand what was going on - the information was so incomplete. I was sucking up as much detail as I could and starting to feel like things were a bit out of control. The more I read, the worst I felt, and eventually I decided that I needed to pull back. I have continued listening to The Guardian Science podcasts about covid, for some hard facts about the science. I try to plan my lunch break so I can watch the New Zealand daily briefing, and I have started watching the 6pm News on TV (something we had fallen out of the habit of before Covid as we tended to get our news online). For New Zealand news I have been reading the Radio New Zealand website, and I still dip into The Times and The Guardian online when I want to know more about the world picture. The Prime Minister started doing daily briefings to the media just before lockdown, often with the Director General of Health (chief civil servant at our Ministry of Health), occasionally other Ministers and the Director of Public Health stand-in, and more recently the Director General has done the briefings alone. The briefing is normally at 1pm, and is broadcast live on one of the main free to air TV channels  The New Zealand briefing always has a sign language interpreter (or actually a few that swap in and out). I think sign language is the third official language of New Zealand, alongside English and Maori. Recordings of the briefings are available online, on the government covid website and on the TV channel website.  More recently the briefings have stopped happening at weekends, and instead the Ministry of Health releases a written update on virus cases and test numbers. All the New Zealand case and test numbers and a number of graphs and charts are also published on the Ministry of Health website. I believe that in general New Zealanders are happy with how our Government has handled the pandemic. Reading about what is going on around the world it feels like New Zealand has dodged a bullet. The lockdown has felt very extreme at times, given how few cases we have had in comparison with other countries, but I am grateful our Government has given us very clear direction: we had to stay home and our wages were subsidised rather than us having to weigh up the risks ourselves of whether going out to earn money was worth it. From the beginning the focus here was on saving lives by trying to eliminate the virus completely This was explained as a health  response that would also give the country the best chance economically, as the period where the economy was shut down would be shorter.  It is too early to know if this was the best approach, but I think it has been easy for the country to get behind the message of staying home to save lives, and putting people before profit. As we got towards the end of our initial Alert 4 lockdown there were people speaking up about we should be getting back to work quickly, but I think the progression down through the alert levels has been well handled and I have confidence that our Government is using the best information they have to make sensible decisions. Now in Alert level 2 there is more chatter about whether specific rules are good or bad and about how the Government isn´t doing enough to help particular sections of society or particular industries, but this is around the detail rather than the substance of the Governmetn response. Compared with the New Zealand Government I think the British Government response was too slow, and they haven´t prioritised the right things, and their communication has been muddled. I have been working from home throughout lockdown. I am self-employed and am part way through a 6 month contract which usually requires me to work at my employers premises. On Monday 23 March we were all sent home from the office after a Government announcement about the plans to move up the alert levels. I was told to take my laptop and anything else I needed to work from home, and to assume I would not be back in the office for a long time (ie don´t leave any perishables). The office building only opened back up on Monday 18 May, but will be run at 50% occupancy until further notice. Staff have been split into two groups and are allowed into the office alternate weeks. However, for most people it is optional to come into the office at all, so many of my colleagues have chosen to stay home for now.  Some people are staying home because they are still nervous about the health risk, others because it is more convenient for them. I am due to be in the office for the first time next week after 9 weeks at home, but at this stage will probably only go in one or two days. I am fairly confident that working in the office with hardly anyone there is pretty low risk, but I am concerned about catching a train to get there. I have not enjoyed working from home: I have felt isolated and unmotivated and have found the amount of time I am in front of a screen and on conference calls very tiring. I do not like the way the lines between work and home have been blurred during this period. I have tried to combat this by working in one room (our spare bedroom) and closing the door and trying not to go in that room at the weekends. But it is one of the darkest, coldest rooms in the house and being stuck in there all day might be worse than having work spill out to the rest of the house. I have had feelings of guilt because compared with people who have lost their jobs or whose financial situation is more precarious than mine, I am very lucky, but I am still annoyed by it all.  My workspace at home is pretty decent, I have a large desk and a good chair and can close the door on the rest of the household (my partner) if needed. I was having trouble with just a laptop screen (at work I have two large monitors) so we ordered a monitor online and that has made things easier and me a bit more productive. I have continued to be paid at the same rate for all hours worked, up to my pre­lockdown standard working week of 30 hours. Before lockdown I used to do my 30 hours over 4 days (roughly 7.5 hours per day), and have one day off each week.  Having a day off a week was a bit pointless in lockdown, so I changed to working my 30 hours over 5 days, ideally 6 hours a day, but this proved difficult some days because people booked meetings assuming I worked full time hours, so if I have done too many hours on previous days I try to finish work at lunchtime on a Friday.  As we head back to the office and have more freedom to get around I am trying to move back to my 4 days a week situation. I am currently working in a team of 6, within a larger department of around 50 people. My team has a regular daily 'stand-up' meeting that used to be at 9.30 in the office, but moved to 8.30 whilst we have been at home because no one has to commute and so we were finding we were ready to start work earlier.  We are moving it back to 9.30 now as our routines get more back to normal.  Some of the people in my team have enjoyed working from home because they have found it easier to concentrate, although there has been frustration about the number of meetings some days. We used to have a weekly coffee catch-up when we were in the office, which we have moved online.  We meet via online meeting software (Microsoft Teams) and all turn our cameras on (for most other meetings we keep them off and just have audio) and talk about things other than work.  Some team members like to relocate outside for this (weather dependent), or include their pets. We also tried a team lunch one time, where we sat at our computers with lunch and chatted while we ate. It sounds weird but it was actually nice. We are quite a new team, who only started working together in February, so this online socialising has helped us to get to know each other a bit better.  One of our team had twins last week and we all got to meet them online this week which was lovely and maybe something that wouldn´t have happened in quite that way pre-Covid. I was also on a call this week with someone who I know outside of work (his partner is a very close friend of mine), and his daughter heard me and came on the call to say hello, which was cute and seems to be okay behaviour in current times. Our department has a weekly general meeting where the leadership team makes announcements and gives updates on how things are going. Again this is done via Microsoft Teams which was a product we would use sometimes before lockdown for meetings with colleagues in other locations. We are all asked to mute our microphones and turn off our cameras and then just the person speaking turns on their camera and microphone. Any questions are via a chat session in the meeting software or privately afterwards. Some team members are not very good at following these rules and so we sometimes get to watch someone eating a biscuit, or yawning, or staring aimlessly out of the window obviously not realising everyone can see them. And then there are the random background noises, or the loud typing which can be a bit annoying. I think someone was loading their dishwasher during one meeting! Our department also tried hosting a weekly social  hour on a Friday, to replace end of the week drinks in the office, I have never been to this in lockdown, it just seems like it would be awkward. I am also invited from time to time to meetings with more senior staff for general updates and a bit of morale boosting - 'you´re all doing a great job in the circumstances' kinds of stuff.  Where the attendance is larger some senior managers are using Workplace (Facebook for businesses) to broadcast.  There are regular emails and online posts (on the work intranet) keeping us informed about what is happening around the business the same as before lockdown. My manager said she would be calling to check in on all her direct reports 1 on 1 each week, but I have only had 3 (or 4) calls in 7 weeks. I am not sure if that is because I am pretty low maintenance, or because I am contractor rather than a permanent employee. I think in general the company where I work has been trying to support us all at home, and as far as I know there have been no redundancies, although it will be interesting, as everything opens up and the longer term financial impacts become more apparent, to see if there will be job losses. My partner has his own business and was unable to open under alert levels 4 or 3, so he has only gone back to work this week. 7 weeks is a long time for a business to have no income. Luckily he is his own landlord so he could pause rent payments, and the Government wage subsidy enabled him to keep paying himself, his business partner and his one employee something over the lockdown period. He is now looking at what other Government relief he can access to provide some cashflow while he waits for things to get moving again. He thinks his business is still viable, but it is clear that a lot has changed around the world and it is hard to know how that impacts his ability to make money.  Luckily we are both savers and have a financial cushion that means we are not under any financial stress right now. Our bank has allowed us to reduce our mortgage payments for the next 6 months, and our expenses during lockdown were very low.  I have noticed however that our supermarket shop is more expensive than pre-lockdown. For the first 5 weeks of lockdown my partner was at home all the time whilst I was working, which was sometimes tricky but also less lonely.  He started getting up later and staying up later, and one morning stubbled from bed into my office and a (only audio luckily) meeting.  He was wearing only his pants and asking me what the time was - which was funny in retrospect but a bit embarrassing at the time. Over the first couple of weeks we developed a lockdown routine where we would sit together for lunch and watch the daily new briefing at 1pm. Then I would finish work around 3.30 and could go and do my daily walk, or an online exercise thing. He was doing all the food shopping and most of the cooking. We started having our dinner earlier than normal because we were home, and also started going to bed earlier (because there is a limit to what you have to talk about when neither of you has been anywhere). We have both put on weight during lockdown, from a mixture of eating more and moving less. To fill his time my partner took bike rides (going out for daily ´local´ exercise was permitted here), planned elaborate meals, baked bread and found projects to do around the house and garden. When the projects that it was possible to do without access to DIY supplies ran out and he was bored of cooking, he got grumpy and played online games. Since we moved to level 3 he has been going to his business premises most working days, doing sorting and organising and cleaning ready for opening again. He also stores parts from a car he is restoring at his work, so when he ran out of ´work´ things to do he has been cleaning and sorting those. I think he has enjoyed having time for projects, but has not liked having no income. We have both been keeping in touch with friends and family a lot more than normal, partly from worry and partly as something to do to fill the time. As we live in New Zealand and have lots of family and friends back in the UK we were already using Skype and FaceTime before Covid19 came along. Before Covid19 I would talk to my Mum roughly once a fortnight, via a paid for Skype service that allows me to call her landline from my computer or phone (she does have Skype on her tablet, but doesn´t keep the tablet on all the time or near her to hear the Skype calls coming through). Now I am talking to her 2-3 times a week and checking in with my sister to try and spread our calls out throughout the week, so Mum is talking to someone most days (she lives alone). My Dad calls me via Skype about once a fortnight which is similar to how often we talked before Covid19. He is locked down in England with his lady friend - they were not living together before this. My sister and I would usually talk once a week pre-Covid19, now it is 2-3 times per week with a lot more text messages in between. My partner would FaceTime his parents once a month, but that is more like weekly now.  He also has an Uncle who lives in New Zealand, and they FaceTime fairly regularly normally (once a week/fortnight) - the frequency of those calls has also increased. My brother and I would generally speak via Skype or WhatsApp calls once every few months - but I have spoken to him 4 or 5 times since the start of lockdown. In the beginning of lockdown I heard from a few old friends, and I also reached out to friends overseas. I have been using messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, a lot more since lockdown, to just check in with people with a quick note. Depending on the time difference I might end up having a bit of a chat if they respond straight away.  I have been very careful with the tone of my messages as I am very aware other people may be having a very different experience to me.  I have been having better and worse days, when I am feeling more or less positive about the future and when my energy levels are higher or lower, so I figure everyone else is similar but on their own scale. Most people seem happy for a message and are trying to make the best of lockdown, at least thats what they tell you in a quick chat. There is also quite a bit of joking and humour, about new activities tried and gone wrong, or home schooling/home working problems. A couple of my friends are in pretty tough situations, which is hard to hear about, but there isn´t anything to do except for listen. Early on in lockdown I called my Aunt in England.  I usually communicate with her by email rather than calling, but I was thinking of her and her husband being in the vulnerable category, and also that she doesn´t have any children of her own who would be checking up on her.  She was keen to stay connected with me and my siblings and suggested a group chat. Apparently her husband´s family were doing something like this so that relatives in different countries could feel connected.  After much backwards and forwards another Uncle set up a group that includes me and my sister and brother and their kids, and my cousins and the original Aunt and Uncle.  We have shared some photos of our lockdown walks and home baking, and compared experiences around the rules where we are living and our working or schooling situations. The level of communication on the group has dropped quite a bit since we first set it up. I am finding I have less energy for keeping in touch as the lockdown goes on, and there is so little news when we are all just stuck at home that there is nothing much to chat about. Also as we in New Zealand start to come out of lockdown and life here gets back to normal I feel awkward about being so much better off than others - which is not to say that anyone in the chat is having a particularly difficult time. My energy for most things has dropped off during lockdown.  The first few weekends I set myself tasks to sort through long forgotten cupboards and boxes. I sorted through old photos and letters, and I don´t think I was alone, I have been sent old photos by friends and family that they had uncovered obviously during similar sorting. I tried to get into some stay at home hobbies too: I tackled a few jigsaws and some embroidery; I wrote letters; hunted out my kindle although never actually read anything on it; in the garden I got down to my ready for Winter weeding and my partner tackled some major excavation in preparation for a vegetable patch we have been planning for a couple of years. I went back to trying to learn Indonesian, despite my major motivation for this -a plan to go and teach English there - is not really viable at the moment. Without a commute I was 'home' from work early, and with trying to stick to my 6 hour work days, and my partner not working at all, we started having dinner early (5pm) and then being ready for bed by about 9pm having watched enough TV and not having anything to talk about.  As lockdown stretched out my motivation for hobbies faded and my major past time now is watching TV: Netflix, Lightbox and TV OnDemand as well as a lot of The Chase (UK version shown at 5pm every day here).  I have watched a number of UK drama series that are available via our free to air channels here. I have also been listening to a lot of podcasts, including a few new ones that I have found during lockdown. My commitment to exercise at the beginning of lockdown was really good, but has reduced through lockdown to almost nothing now.  In the first few weeks I was getting out most days for a walk around the suburb (maintaining physical distance from others of course). From our house I either walked down the hill and up another road to do a loop, or crossed the highway at the bottom and walked along/beside the beach. I generally walked at lunchtime or after work in the week, and early morning at the weekend to avoid meeting too many people. One time my partner and I took a walk together, but mostly he preferred to go cycling.  The weather was pretty good for the first few weeks we were home, and I noticed an increase in birds around - presumably because there was less traffic noise.  My weekly dance exercise class was cancelled before the lockdown, but the teachers made daily classes available for free via instagram, and I tried those out 2 or 3 times. I also did yoga a couple of times along with YouTube videos by a lady called Adrienne, whose online classes I have done from time to time in the past. After 3 weeks or so that all started feeling too hard, and around that time our clocks changed and it started getting darker earlier in the evenings. As we moved further into Autumn we experienced a couple of storms that kept me in for a few days and next thing I knew I had not left the house for a week! Now, as the lockdown is lifting there is no real restriction on being out and about walking, but despite meaning to get up and go walking at the weekend I haven´t managed to recapture the initial lockdown enthusiasm for the outdoors. As soon as lockdown was announced I decided I was going to do an experiment to not wash my hair - isn´t the natural balance of oils supposed to return eventually so you don´t need to wash it? I lasted a couple of weeks, at which point my hair was really gross and greasy.  I was rinsing it in the shower, but no shampoo.  I was having to tie it back everyday and was really embarrassed to turn my video camera on for work calls. At this point my partner observed that it was hard to tell if I was wearing pyjamas or not because my clothing was so casual it looked like sleepwear.  I was also showering less, and some mornings would just fall out of bed and pull on something loose and elasticated about 10 minutes before my first meeting of the day.  I usually dress quite smartly for work, although it isn´t required and most of my colleagues just wear jeans. I generally have separate clothes for work and home, but this division had blurred and I was 'going to work' wearing things I might slouch around the house in, but never wear out in public. One day I just decided to wash my hair and I felt really great afterwards and I realised that not bothering to get dressed properly or wash my hair had not been good for me and I felt much more positive for making the effort.  Since then I have been showering daily and washing my hair every couple of days - my pre-Covid normal schedule. I have long hair at the moment, and I usually get it cut every 6 or 7 weeks, so I haven´t minded too much not being able to go to the hairdressers. I also stopped dying my hair a few years ago when the battle against the white hairs was becoming too time-consuming, so I haven´t been missing having it coloured. I am booked in to have a cut next weekend now that hairdressers have been allowed to reopen, I am a little bit nervous about it, but I also think I should try and get back to normal things. My hairdresser called to reschedule after my usually appointment didn´t go ahead due to lockdown. It was really nice to hear from her, although she is not exactly a friend, she has cut my hair for lots of years and it was just good to speak to someone different!"

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Health and wellbeing are synonyms which include both physical and mental health, one cannot have either without the other. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Active, vigorous, strong, stable, relative Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Perhaps Da Vinci’s Vitruvian man? But no not really. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? My own experience of health and wellbeing have certainly been shaped by all aspects of my identity, but those processes are ongoing and subconscious. I couldn’t say how they have influenced me in any specific way. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I don’t recall becoming aware of ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ as abstract concepts in their own right. I suppose they have taken on increased meaning as they have probably become more prevalent over the past twenty years or so in the media, particularly as life expectancy has levelled out. Probably the biggest shift for me came when I worked for a year in the School of Sports Exercise and Health Sciences at L University when they were part of the constant background noise in my working environment. MO Number: G7039  Male  Married  35  PhD Student  Loughborough  Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My patents, they both did a great job, as evidenced by my still being here now, aged 35. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Not really, it wasn’t a taboo topic or anything but I’m struggling to remember any significant conversations or events where health was the principal focus. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Yes, presumably anyway, though I stillcan’t remember anything specific or that strikes me as significant. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I can remember that my Mother stopped bathing me around the age of 10, but I don’t remember anything of the changes which my body underwent in the following years. My voice must have broken at some point, I definitely started shaving and I had my fair share of teenage angst, but I have no recollection of these things happening or of them leaving any real long term impression. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? MO Number: G7039  Male  Married  35  PhD Student  Loughborough  I haven’t really done anything specific to actively maintain my physical health which fortunately with the exception of appendicitis, asthma and sinusitis as a child/teenager has been excellent. In terms of mental health, I remember hearing the Dan Le Sac vs Scroobious Pip song Thou Shalt Always Kill being a catalysing moment in my early twenties which helped me to snap out of my post-teenage malaise. Specifically, the lyrics “XXX”. I remember hearing this and thinking “shit, that’s right, this is something which I can take charge of myself. It’s strange to put it down to a single song (it was in reality part of a wider corpus of music which I was listening to at the time) but I think in reality I only needed a nudge in the right direction Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? From the NHS, doctors, and pharmacists. I’m not prone to hypochondria and don’t really seek it out unless it’s for something specific. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? Much more because ones bodily experience changes as we age, backache is a constant reminder of this but a fair price to pay for being able to walk upright! In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? It is likely that it will change, time marches on and priorities change, although I’m hesitant to make any predictions, check in with me in a couple of years! Health, wellbeing, and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? In general, one’s physical health is inherent to and inseparable from ones external appearance. Mental health certainly isn’t indivisiblein the same way, but many mental health problems can manifest with physical symptoms (for example in weight gain or loss or general dishevelment) hence the (relatively new) claim that ‘not all disabilities are visible. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Not really, or rather not consciously. The thing with popular ideals of beauty is to be really effective they need to be expressed through “disinterested interest” (see Bourdieu’s Distinction (which I finished reading yesterday…)). It does pain me to think of women putting on makeup as an additional (literal) layer of defence against the world though, those who do shouldn’t feel compelled to, but this is a problem with society rather than with women wearing makeup. MO Number: G7039  Male  Married  35  PhD Student  Loughborough  Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Yes, probably through the lack of attention which they paid to the topic and I pay to the topic. The family mantra could well be “enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think”. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you could not live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I could not live without soap, everything else is optional. Following on from what I’ve written above my ‘Desert Islanditem’ would be cigarettes. One ofthe few things I have in common with Nick Clegg nowadays. Getting ready to leave the house. Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Not really, I remember my Father getting ready for work, but I couldn’t describe anything specific other than him being in his uniform. When they went out on Saturday nights were the only times I can remember my Mother wearing perfume, but I can’t remember much more than the smell of eau d’ toilette. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Check for keys, phone, wallet. I tend to pack my bag the night before if I’m taking one. In addition to work stuff (i.e., uniform for the pub) I’ll make sure that I’ve got a pen and something to read, (less important now I have a smartphone) antacids and a bottle of water (more important I’m more conscious ofsingle use plastics). The old routine used to be “keys, phone, fags, wallet, lighter” but I don’t smoke like I used to anymore."

The first five words that come to me when I think of a healthy body are: “well­formed,” “happy,” “unrestricted,” “beautiful” and “fresh.” Two of my cousins come to mind when I think of a healthy body. One of them has glowing skin and very white teeth, and I know she has been vegan for a number of years. My other cousin goes on park runs frequently, and she has a rosy complexion. Identity I think being (and identifying as) female has had a large influence in my experience of health and wellbeing. There is a lot of societal expectation around women having to look a certain way, and it has at times made me feel inferior as a woman. As someone with an hourglass figure, I feel extremely underrepresented and I rarely see women with bodies similar to my own in films and TV shows. On the occasions they do make an appearance, they are often characterised as strippers or prostitutes. I often struggle to find clothes that suit me, since I don’t have an hourglass role model I can look up to. I am very happy that there has been more plus size representation in film and TV, but I would also like to see more women with different body types. I have also noticed a lack of short women as main characters too. R7210 I therefore think my impression of what a healthy female body was supposed to look like was tainted for a long time. I now realise it is impossible for me to be “thin” in a healthy way, because my body structure is simply not built like that. I am now focusing on improving my core, arm and leg strength, and toning these parts of my body. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I am assuming I first became aware of “health” and “wellbeing” during doctor appointments I had when I was around five. For a long time, I remember telling people I had a sore throat. I saw many doctors but none of them could figure out what was wrong. Eventually, I saw an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist and he correctly guessed that the “problem” would go away on its own. I also remember learning about body image at around the same age during ballet classes when my ballet teacher told us to hold in our stomachs so she couldn’t see our breakfasts! My parents were responsible for my health and wellbeing. They were good at taking me to the necessary doctors' appointments and took any ailments I had seriously. They didn’t talk to me directly about health, but they did teach me about the nutritional values of the food and drink I consumed. When I was seven, I remember taking part in the “Food and Fitness for Families Project” in my primary school. I was only there because my mum was a volunteer helper, but I think I did pick up a few tips on healthy food and exercise. Throughout primary school, there were various lessons on eating healthy and exercising but I can’t remember much about what I learnt in them. Key Moments I started puberty relatively early, at around ten (although I was one of the oldest in my year). My breasts grew bigger, my hips grew wider and I also started to grow pubic hair. I remember feeling very insecure having to wear my first crop top, since everyone in my class had to change in the classroom for PE lessons. My friends noticed and called it a “chocolate bar,” an anagram for bra! Even when I started high school, my body was very overdeveloped compared to most of other girls; I don’t think we all caught up with each other until we were around fourteen. My mum didn’t really keep track of my bra size; I wore a 32A for most of my first year in high school, when it should have really been a 32D! I do find it interesting that my period was the last stage of puberty to happen to me; it didn’t start until I was thirteen. I remember the experience very well, since my mum was just about to leave to pick my sister up from Guides when it started. She helped me in a rush, and I remember feeling very confused. I can’t exactly remember when I first started shaving, but I only did it in order to “fit in” with the other girls in PE lessons. I still shave now, just because I like having smooth legs, but I’m more lax about it than I used to be. Growing Older I did little to maintain my mental health until I was fourteen. I felt extremely anxious, and sometimes had depressive thoughts, so my school counsellor recommended me R7210 to try meditation. It truly changed my life, and I now meditate every morning for ten minutes. It helps to ground me in the present moment, and calm my emotions. Up until the lockdown, the only physical activities I did were walking and ballet twice a week. Although I was exercising daily, it was very low-intensity, and looking back, I think my body needed more than what I did. I hated PE lessons, because we had to wear very figure-hugging PE shirts, and I felt very insecure in myself. The teachers were always yelling at us to try harder, so it wasn’t a nice environment to be in. However, when the March lockdown started, my ballet classes and daily walks to school stopped, and I knew I had to keep up my exercise somehow. I started following home workouts on YouTube and soon jumped onto the trend of doing monthly challenges set by the fitness Youtuber Chloe Ting, who went viral during the lockdown. This was the first high-intensity exercise I did on a regular basis, and I soon realised I had lost some weight. My appearance changed because of it, and I felt much more confident in myself. I kept up with the workouts even when school started again, and now that I am back to online school, I have started another one of Chloe Ting’s challenges. I rarely need information on health and wellbeing, but if I had any queries, I would use the internet, or ask my parents. If I had any concerns about my mental health, I would ask my school counsellor. I would say that I am more aware of my body now, because although I have finished puberty, I would say that I’m still developing into my “adult” body. I have noticed it change for the better, and I think I will become less conscious about it over time. I am also more concerned about any physical symptoms I experience, since it could be an indicator that I have COVID-19. In future years, I know that I will have to change how I exercise if I move into a flat or shared accommodation after I leave home. Health, wellbeing and appearance In my opinion, I don’t think you can regard yourself as being in good mental health unless you like your external appearance. This doesn’t necessarily mean changing your physical appearance, you might just have to change how you see yourself mentally. I also believe that if you look after yourself mentally, your physical appearance will automatically improve. I definitely have been influenced by popular ideals of beauty, but less so by celebrities (as I mentioned in the identity section, I haven’t found anyone I can look up to) than my peers in school. I generally try to dress like everyone else and I usually do my hair and makeup when going to (in-person) school. I admit this is very shallow, and I hope I will find my own style as I grow older. I think my mum has been influenced by popular ideals of beauty, but less so than other adults her age. She did teach me how to shave my legs, therefore passing down that beauty standard to me. A few months ago, I watched a video explaining that the idea that women had to shave their legs came from companies that wanted to make money from selling shaving products. I still continue to shave, but I always keep this idea in the back of my head. R7210 I think the only health products I use daily are soap, deodorant, and lip balm. I shower three times a week, in which I use shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and argan oil. I also use shaving cream. When I wear makeup, I use concealer, blusher, bronzer and mascara. I think my Desert Island product would have to be beeswax lip balm, closely followed by my over-the-counter iron tablets I take. They have transformed my life; I no longer feel super tired during the daytime. Getting ready to leave the house I don’t remember my parents having any specific ritual before going to work (they work from home now). If they were going out for the evening, my mum would usually have a shower, wear some fancier clothes than usual, and put on a little bit of makeup – usually just tinted moisturiser and eyeliner. Before school moved online, I had quite a strict routine before leaving the house. I would get up, get dressed straightaway, have breakfast, put on some makeup and straighten my hair. I usually did this all in a rush, and I miss that excitement in wondering whether I was going to be late for school or not. I usually take out a bit more time in getting ready to socialise, since I have to spend time choosing an outfit. I also spend more time doing my hair and makeup. Now that we are in lockdown again, I never bother with hair and makeup, and I wear whatever clothes I am comfiest in. I think this is much more sensible, and I hope I will continue with it once the lockdown ends."

Since I last wrote about COVID-19 for Mass Observation, staying at home has become quite draining. I find it hard to believe that there will ever be a time where I will be able to see other people again, but I know this won’t last forever. The number of new cases each day here are gradually decreasing and I think most people are now focusing on how the “new normal” is going to be enforced when we are allowed out again. Health Thankfully, none of the people I live with have suffered any major physical or mental health issues during this lockdown period. None of us have shown any symptoms of the virus so far. A few years ago, I was suffering with mental health issues and I saw a councillor at school once a week. Over time, I reduced seeing them to once a month as my mental health started to improve. When school closed, they emailed me to say that they would check in with me once a fortnight, as they are doing with all their other pupils that they see. Emailing them has really helped me to work through any issues that I have and I am so grateful to have someone outside of the family who will listen to me. My emotions have been extremely varied over the past few weeks. I have noticed that they will drop dramatically if I feel I haven’t had a “productive” day. This usually entails schoolwork, reading in the garden, violin practise, working out and writing. I would love to get out of this mindset where I feel that spending an entire day on my phone is a bad thing, but I am finding it very difficult! I think it is because I was working very hard for my GCSEs, and so when they were suddenly cancelled, my brain found it hard to adjust to the fact that I no longer have to do any work if I don’t want to. Since it was supposed to be half term next week, I am not going to do any schoolwork during this time. I hope this will improve my mental health. The Government At the moment, Wales, Scotland and Northern Island are still being told to stay at home, but the British Government is allowing people in England to see people outside their household as long as they are socially distant from one another. They have also said that Primary Schools may open to some students on the 1st June. I understand that they want to get the economy moving again, but I am worried that this is happening too soon. Since we have the second highest number of deaths from the virus in the world, it concerns me that we are moving faster than a lot of other countries. I also think the government is underestimating how hard it will be to socially distance, especially in cities. In the coming months, permitting that the R number is still low, I think that the British Government will open schools in September and allow lots more people to go back to work. However, I don’t think any of this will be full time and I doubt that anything will go completely back to normal until a vaccine is found. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was another spike in cases, especially during July and August when people may think it is safe to socialise again. Overall, I think the government is more focused on restarting the economy rather than saving lives, and already the impact of this has been devastating. News I mostly check the BBC website for news. I prefer to do this in the afternoon so it is not the first or last thing I think about. I find that lots of it is negative and since everything is beginning to calm down I have checked it less. My mental health is definitely improving because of it. We haven’t been watching the daily government briefings, but we always know it’s happening because our wifi usually goes down at five o’clock! My mum prefers to watch the ten o’clock news as it  just gives the main details. I usually go to bed at this time or I lose sleep thinking about what I’ve watched. No one I know has experienced challenges with accessing the news and I believe it’s vital that it is accessible for everyone during these times. I have noticed the BSL interpreters at Nicola Sturgeon’s broadcasts and wondered why they weren’t used for general UK broadcasts. I think they should be introduced as soon as possible. I also think it would be good if the briefings were translated into other languages. It could help people living in the UK who don’t have English as their first language or don’t speak it at all to understand what’s going on much better. Work and home life My GCSEs were cancelled, and I therefore have no compulsory work that I need to be doing. However, my school has put up optional tasks for us to step into our A level subjects. I have decided to only focus on the subjects I am taking next year, which are English, French, History and Welsh. For French and Welsh, I learn vocabulary and grammar and I have also been watching films and TV in those languages. I have been reading the Wolf Hall trilogy for History, as we are studying the Tudors next year and I am currently on the third book, The Mirror and the Light. For English, I have been working my way through classic novels. Since lockdown began, I have read The Great Gatsby, Wuthering Heights and David Copperfield. All of the work has been really enjoyable and I feel like I am making much more progress at home. In school, I had to spend a lot of time doing work that didn’t seem to teach me anything at all, and I definitely prefer to work independently. Lockdown hasn’t had a very big impact on my home life. As I am quite introverted, I like to spend lots of time at home anyways. I don’t think any of the relationships with the people I live with has changed much. My parents can be annoying at times, but I know that they mean well, so I can cope with it. My sister and I get along well, and we do this by leaving each other alone most of the time. If I ever get really irritated by them, I’ll go up to my room for a while. I feel very privileged to have a space I can call my own and it has been invaluable during lockdown. Technology As a teenager, I am used to using technology, but for my parents, this has been a challenge. They have never had a smartphone before, but I have given them my old one so they can be on our extended family’s group chat. It took them some time to get used to it, but they rarely need to ask for my help with it anymore. My mum’s work asked her to trial Google Classrooms with the classes she teaches, and since my sister and I use it for school, we taught her how to use it. My mum made a fake class for us to join and gave us some “assignments” for us to do. In school, we have to use Google Classrooms responsibly, so I took the opportunity to spam the comments section of this fake class! I have been having online violin lessons. I use Google Duo for this, and the video calls have only cut out once or twice. I have noticed that the quality is much worse when someone else in my house is on a video call, so we have been trying to schedule them at different times. My friends sometimes video call me on FaceTime or Whatsapp. It’s nice to catch up with them and there are only ever connection problems when the wifi dips at the five o’clock briefing time. I have always struggled with communicating with my friends online and I much prefer talking face to face. Texting makes me feel anxious and I often take hours if not days to reply to them. Thankfully, my friends are very understanding about this. All of my extended family live outside Wales and through technology, we are now seeing more of them in lockdown than we did before! We have been keeping in touch with my dad’s -very large -family through our group chat on WhatsApp. Many of them live in London and some of them have had COVID-19, so this chat is a great way to check in on them. We have kept in touch with my mum’s side of the family through Zoom. We have done an online “escape room” with some of my cousins and though it took hours to solve, it was lots of fun. We are going to do a second one with them later today. I have been using social media to escape what’s going on. I use Instagram the most, as it is a good way to see what my friends have been up to. My ballet school and my orchestra group both have Facebook pages, so I have been following them for any updates or resources that they share. I have found TikTok to be the best way to completely switch off from the outside world and have enjoyed spending hours watching funny videos on there. Shopping and Food My mum is the “designated shopper” in our family and tends to do a big shop at Sainsbury’s early on Tuesday morning, and a smaller shop at our local Tesco on Saturday morning. We are vegetarian and there has been a lot less meat and fish alternatives available for us, as well as baking goods.  At the beginning of lockdown, the fruit and veg company we use stopped delivering for a few weeks, but we now have our weekly deliveries back again. My eating habits have definitely changed during lockdown. I am now drinking over 2 litres of water everyday, and it has made me feel so much better about myself. I have also been snacking less, as I am using up less of my energy. My sister and I now cook a meal for us and our parents every Friday and it has been fun learning how to cook properly. Entertainment and Leisure By far my favourite part of lockdown is how much more time I have to do my favourite thing in the world: writing! I like to write first thing in the morning, and when I was at school, that meant getting up at 5.30! Since lockdown, I have been getting up at 8.00 and writing for an hour and a half before breakfast. Doing this puts me in a positive mindset for the rest of the day. I now have time to edit my work too, and I like to do this around mid-afternoon. As a result of all this extra time, I am now extremely close to finishing my story, and considering I have been writing it for over two years, this is very exciting for me. Another thing I have loved doing since lockdown is spending time in the garden. I feel extremely grateful to have one right now and I try to go there at least once a day. I have enjoyed re-reading some of my old childhood books, including The Hunger Games and His Dark Materials trilogies and the Harry Potter series. I have also read lots of stories by two of my favourite authors, Hilary Mckay and Jane Gardam. If I don’t feel like reading, I have some scratch boards that I can draw pictures on, and it’s very therapeutic. I am currently doing a big spring clean of my room to make it a nicer place to work in. So far, I have sorted out my wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelves, desk, and storage boxes. Tomorrow, I shall attempt to dust all of these spaces, which I have been putting off for weeks! I have been doing lots of exercise at home to make up for the forty minutes it would usually take to get me to school. Every evening, I do a fifteen minute HIIT workout by myself, and then another one later with my mum. I think my core strength has greatly improved because of this. On the weekends, I like to do a barre work video that my ballet teacher sent me. I have been watching a lot more Netflix since lockdown began. Some of my favourite movies I’ve seen so far are The Breakfast Club, Crazy Beautiful You, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Midnight Sun and Ladies in Black. I have just finished the series Outer Banks and I loved it! It was about a group of teenagers who go searching for gold and it was very fast paced and exciting. I did feel a little sad watching it though, seeing as I will probably be spending my summer being 16 stuck at home instead of having adventures. Personal Hygiene My personal hygiene hasn’t changed much since lockdown. I only have one pair of black leggings which I have worn almost all the time, but I change my t-shirts every day. Since it is getting hotter I like to wear shorts and sometimes dresses, but I certainly don’t miss jeans! I have to have a shower every other day, or my hair gets very greasy, so that routine hasn’t changed. I think I have been shaving more than I usually do, as I like to go out to the garden to tan since the weather has been hotter. I have been feeling much better about my body since lockdown began, as I finally have the time to take care of it properly. Sleep I have always been very lucky when it comes to sleep and rarely have problems with insomnia or nightmares. I am definitely getting much more sleep since lockdown. I got around seven hours sleep when I had school, but I get at least nine hours now. Sleep is what motivates me to work out, as it takes me much less time to fall asleep when I do so. I usually go through phases of having very vivid and crazy dreams for about one week every four months. This last happened in late February but since lockdown, it feels as if they have continued, although they are much less vivid. My craziest dream so far was a few weeks ago when I delivered a baby in Tesco! It was right next to the checkouts and I remember feeling very pleased with myself when I had done it. I also remember another dream I had where I went to the theatre at 11.30 PM with some of my friends from primary school and one friend from high school. We kept stopping off at different places and I was worried that we were going to be late. When we eventually arrived, it was not the play I originally thought it would be, An Inspector Calls, but a production of Grease (An Inspector Calls was the play I was supposed to be studying for my English Literature exam, which my mum and I had seen a week before lockdown. We had watched Grease as a family a few nights before this dream). The most interesting dream I had was last week. I was looking in the mirror and was watching my hair, which was spiky and sticking up everywhere, turning grey! I was very freaked out by this, but my mum who was with me in the dream said that it would turn back again and she was right. I think this was probably symbolic to all the time that has flown by in these past few months."

Age: 64; Occupation: Retired teacher Part two: Everyday health and well being Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Health is concerned with illness and injury. Good health is about having little or no issues with either illness or injury. Everyday activities are not hampered. Wellbeing adds to good physical health a dimension of positive emotional health. A sense of feeling warm and positive about yourself and your life and the ability to cope with problems as they arise. An overall feeling of contentment. Healthy body in five words: Pain-free; Strong; Content; Confident; Warm A healthy person is someone who maintains a healthy body and happy mind. They achieve and keep to a sensible weight, eat well and take regular, appropriate levels of exercise. They interact with others as they wish to. There is a balance to their lives physically and emotionally as they avoid excesses that might unsettle them. They are confident and content in who they are and what they stand for and make decisions that are in their own best interests whilst being mindful of others around them. Identity Although in early childhood my parents had little money, they tried hard to ensure we ate well. I can recall visits to a fruit and vegetable market stall late on Saturday afternoons where my father would haggle for some of the remaining, often rather tired looking or over-ripe, produce, which he would turn into fresh fruit salads and coleslaw. My parents had grown up during the second world war, had coped with the demands of rationing and understood the importance of a healthy diet. My parents fed us based on what their own parents had fed them. My father chose fatty joints of meat for Sunday lunch and always insisted we ate all the fat on any meat we were fed because ‘fat is good for you’. My mum dosed us with sugary rosehip syrup and provided is with deep-fried bread to chew on. Twenty first century nutritionists would raise serious concerns about some of the things we were given to eat, although I am sure my parents’ notions about our diet were always well-intentioned. These early experiences about eating fruit and vegetables though, have stayed with me. Later in childhood, my father achieved a better salary, and, in turn, this helped with our general standard of living. We ate well and had choices that some young people were denied. Like almost all my friends from school, for example, I benefited in that ‘baby boomer’ era from the improved housing stock, readily available clean water and the vaccination programmes initiated by the NHS. A lifelong interest in sport has been a significant factor in my attitudes towards health and wellbeing. Lacking the talent of some of my peers I always trained hard to raise my standards of performance which in turn enhanced my awareness of factors that shaped fitness and health. I benefited from having friends who also had a positive approach to fitness and health. Being male and interested in sport during the 1970s and 1980s was also helpful as opportunities for women interested in sport were often more limited, especially after leaving school. Growing up, the prevailing attitudes towards ethnicity and sexual orientation were hampered by a lack of education and understanding. I was certainly aware of prejudiced actions and attitudes towards non-white people and those who, in 2020, would be regarded LGBTQ+. Some of my teammates in the school rugby team were racists. I recall one player, two years older than me, stamping on the head of one of our opponents, simply because he had skin that was a different colour to everyone on his own team. From a personal point of view I was not aware at the time of how I, doubtlessly, benefited by being white and straight. I cannot recall a situation in which any choices I wished to make were limited in any way by my gender (I was male), ethnicity (white British), social class (parents were aspiring to middle class), or sexual orientation (heterosexual). I am confident that my childhood experiences encouraged a positive approach to my health. In this context I was fortunate. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I first became aware of ‘health’ at home when my parents focused on ensuring I (and my two younger brothers) had the benefit of a healthy diet. Certain foods, like fruit, were good for you I was told. Although my father was a heavy smoker, he strongly discouraged me not to smoke because of the growing body of evidence beginning to emerge about its harmful effect on health. He was also a heavy drinker but again worked hard to ensure I had a more sensible approach to alcohol. ‘Wellbeing’ is something I do not recall being aware of until much more recently. As a teacher I recall an increasing awareness of mental health issues in the 1990s when teaching health education classes. However, it is only in the final few years of my career (I retired in 2017) that wellbeing became more prominent. One factor for increased awareness in schools and the media was the growing evidence and concern about suicide rates amongst young people, especially young men. A friend of my son, someone I knew well and taught for several years, committed suicide in his early 30s – those experiences make an impact on personal awareness. At primary school and my early years at high school I recall some health screening taking place at school. Some vaccinations were conducted at school, as were rudimentary dental check-ups. I also recall brief check-ups with doctors who visited schools so that all children could be seen by someone medically qualified. Despite these interventions it was very much my parents who were responsible for my health. They encouraged healthy attitudes about eating and sleeping and were also keen to ensure that their children did not smoke or drink too much. I would praise my parents on how they encouraged a healthy lifestyle in childhood although their role in my overall wellbeing and its emphasis on mental health would need additional consideration. My father was extremely strict with me and my brothers and did not like his views challenged. It led to arguments about matters as varied as how to we should be allowed to have more fashionable haircuts; listen to music he did not like or wear trendier clothes. When I left for university, my father struggled to cope with my brothers becoming more independent and especially when they disagreed with his views or became defiant. One brother has really struggled with his mental health in adulthood and I wonder to what extent this may be a result of the serious tensions that developed between him and my father throughout his adolescence and early adulthood when living at home. I think my father would have struggled with the notion of wellbeing! My parents were excellent about encouraging healthy eating and I recall my father being helpful (and frank) about my sex education. He was mindful of making me and my brothers aware of issues around puberty and sexually transmitted diseases, for example. I can still recall some of these potentially embarrassing conversations being handled with genuine aplomb by my father; I suspect his years in the merchant navy helped here no end! I do not remember much health education being taught at school apart from some basic sex education lessons but do recall conversations about sex with my peers. I still recall walking home with some of the older boys from scouts one evening and one of the older boys telling us about what he had heard about sex. Key moments I do not recall there being many moments when issues around adolescence or puberty caused me too much embarrassment. Having been in the merchant navy for several years before I was born, my father had travelled the world and become aware of the need to ensure I was aware of physical changes as I was growing up. It was my father who was responsible for talking to me about these matters and he did it well. I am certain he was ‘worldly wise’ from an early age and wanted us to avoid potential problems as we got older and moved away from home. On another occasion I remember well the time he did not allow me to join a youth football team with some of my friends because of how the manager acted towards me and a friend when we first met him. My dad explained his concerns to me when we got home, and so I found an alternative club to play for. Two years later the manager my father was so concerned about was jailed for child molestation; some of my friends had been this person’s victims. My father was excellent in this ‘protection’ role. I think the one issue that caused some embarrassment for me was that of facial hair. I matured quite early and had that fuzzy hair on my top lip that drew some attention before I started to shave. I remember doing some shopping at a local newsagent and the proprietor, who knew my parents, saying to me ‘You need to have a shave’. I was about twelve and can still remember blushing in the middle of the shop! I still remember thinking that the man’s comments were unkind; it was certainly one of those moments that I filed away and recalled in adulthood when I hope I would have behaved in a more sensitive way. I have never been someone to share those kinds of experiences described above with other people and am certain that this short but difficult exchange would not have been passed on to my parents. However, the fact that I can so readily recall the conversation over 50 years on, and how it made me feel, reminds me of the vulnerability of young people and the potential impact those kinds of interactions can have on young people as they search for the self-confidence to cope in a raft of social settings. I ought to add that I am sure that the man did not intend to hurt my feelings in any way; but he most certainly did, and I have never forgotten that encounter. I certainly made sure my own son was armed with a razor to deal with fuzzy facial hair before it became a point of potential embarrassment! Growing older My interest and involvement in sport has continued into my mid-60s. This, together with trying to be a positive role model for my own children and those I taught, has meant that I have always wanted to look and feel in good shape. I do not like to look or feel overweight and continue to exercise regularly and am mindful of ensuring I have a healthy diet. For example, I try to ensure that fruit and vegetables are prominent in my diet; even more so in recent years after I had to have colorectal surgery to remove some polyps and then a couple of years ago having a TIA (transient ischaemic attack / mini stroke) both of which I found unsettling. I think I have become more aware of my body and how I need to look after it as I have got older. The health issues I have faced in recent years have made more mindful of what I eat, the importance of not over-exercising (which has certainly been the cause of various joint problems in my 50s and 60s) and that by failing to be proactive about these things is likely to lead to earlier and more difficult problems going forward. I try to keep updated by reading the press about contemporary research and trends and I have an excellent GP who I can call upon if worried about anything. I intend to keep myself well informed. Health, wellbeing and appearance A real hero of mine was a PE teacher who taught me for several years at high school. He was a brilliant sportsman, had a great physique, always looked smart and was noticeably kind to everyone. I have aspired to be like him in these respects ever since! In doing so I have always sought to look after my appearance and continue to me mindful of my body image in my 60s. I think the only currently popular ideal of which I am conscious of is to do with body hair. I have never liked having hair where it should not grow! In the last two decades having no body hair has been the trend for men in the public eye and certainly if they are photographed in swimming trunks or similar. Every few weeks or so, after I have trimmed down my chest hair with an electric razor, I enlist the (reluctant) help of my wife to apply cream to deal with my hairy back. She always tells me that she does not mind it herself and reminds me that she is the only one to see me with a hairy back, but I still go through the ritual of ridding myself of unwanted body hair because it makes me feel good about myself. I try to tell myself that this does not make me a shallow person?! I think my father was a bit vain – I think I am too! I do not think my parents were quite as aware of trends in the way that the next generation became. The 1960s counter-culture movement and growth of social media in the last decade or so has had a huge impact on people, especially younger people, and their attitude towards image projection. The only supplement I take is vitamin D which I read helps boost the body’s immune system. I do use moisturiser products, but largely because I was told to do so on medical grounds having had to have several cryotherapy treatments on my face. I suspect moisturiser would be a choice for a stay on a desert island!  Getting ready to leave the house I cannot remember my father’s early morning routine as he left for work before I was up. I do remember that his return in the evening had only one recurring routine – a large whisky! My own morning rituals have changed over time depending on personal circumstances and the need, for example, to help get our children ready for school. However, in its most recent form, it included a previous-evening shave (to save precious time in the morning), a cup of tea and a banana with BBC Breakfast television and a shower. On arrival at work, around 6.30am, I liked to have a bowl of porridge and another cup of tea. I was usually the first one to arrive at work and by the time I had eaten my porridge and drunk my second cup of tea of the day I had checked emails and made a start on the first jobs of the day before other colleagues had arrived. I loved the solitude of this first hour of the day. Because I like structure and routine there were usually key parts of the routine at the end of the day. A shower, the donning of loose clothing and a beer with food preparation were important components. In retirement daily routines depend on whether I am volunteering at the local hospice. If not at the hospice I try to have a morning walk.

When I imagine ‘a healthy body’ the image in my mind immediately springs to someone in their twenties, when we are usually at the peak of our physical best and still possessing an enthusiastic and positive outlook on life. There is no particular person that comes to mind, anyone in this age group that is active and not suffering from any illness or conditions. I would think of myself when I was at that age, or someone who is presented in the media as ‘typical’: a sportsperson or anyone you might see in an advert; a character on TV or film. This is not bounded necessarily by age, gender, ethnicity or anything else, it is who is usually selected as ‘ideal’ to represent the hero, or suitable to promote a product. Five words: youth, slenderness, smile, tone, good teeth. Identity I don’t think that my health and wellbeing is influenced much by my gender, ethnicity, social class or sexual orientation. That may be due to my being white, male and middle class and, as long as you look after yourself, there isn’t a lot going against that privileged position. Perhaps the only thing I can think of is the expectations I have felt placed upon me as a man. I am not very sporty, and I am of a very slender build with no upper body strength. I simply don’t have a muscular chest, arms or legs! They are naturally quite reedy. When I was younger it used to bother me a somewhat. I felt I ought to be more muscular and even tried weights for a while, but I soon realised I had no muscle to grow and develop. I also felt as a man I should be into sports. I am not. Watching or participating in any of them bores me. I soon decided I was what I was and learned to love my body and embrace my nerdiness. However, I do not consider myself unhealthy. I have certainly never been sickly, which is a blessing. Up until my young teens I joined my parents each weekend on countryside rambles and fell walking, climbing Scafell Pike, Snowdon and Ben Nevis by the time I was 14. Before owning a car, I cycled everywhere and continued to do so often. I have treated it as a means to get around rather than exercise in itself and will still cycle on errands when practicable. Only in recent years have I begun forcing myself to go out on my bike as simple exercise, maybe going 10 miles once a week or so. I consider the cardio-vascular side of this exercise to be most valuable, and as I get older it is of increasing importance. My father died of a heart attack, so it is this aspect of my health that gets my attention. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I cannot recall exactly where and when I became aware of health and wellbeing. Certainly, awareness of health seeped into me from a young age from a variety of sources, but mostly my parents. As a child I was always taught to brush my teeth, have a piece of fruit a day, wash regularly. It was talked about in school, in youth organisations like cubs and scouts that I was part of. It was something you would hear on TV and in magazines. It was generally assumed and promoted, not in an overt way, but it was around in many places. It wasn’t something that I recall being aggressively talked about, promoted or fretted about. Being physically healthy was just something you were, rather than went out of your way to be. I remember my mother walking everywhere; she did not drive. She would walk to the shops, and we thought nothing of walking 2 miles to go to a large park where there was an adventure playground. It was perhaps symptomatic of my parent’s generation. They were both born in 1929 and didn’t own a car until the mid-1960’s, so I inherited their mindset of an age where people supposedly had healthier lives by necessity. Health-consciousness, and after it, well-being, were things that I remember growing in importance. I can recall when jogging was a new craze that came over from the USA. It felt to me that health began to shift from something that you possessed to something that you had to actively ‘add-on’. I don’t recall any great ‘sit-down-and-listen’ conversations from my parents about health, nor from school. For me it is something that is always in the background, talked about, known about, perhaps assumed. Well-being, as I interpret it being more about the mind, is something that has emerged later, to the extent we now see royals and celebrities actively talking about mental health. Key Moments My first awareness of bodily changes associated with puberty were probably getting erections at all sorts of times and places, not always ‘convenient’. I recall being sat in class at school and, unprompted, up one popped leaving me trying to hide it under my desk. I remember having my first wet dream also, but I had read somewhere about that sort of thing happening so although I woke up a little surprised, I soon realised what had happened. I think for girls these moments are more significant. They are less easy to hide, I guess. A first period is going to be messy and doesn’t just go away after time like an erection, it needs cleaning up. Similarly buying a first bra is likely something to be done with a parent, so it doesn’t happen in secret. I don’t recall my voice breaking, or anyone else’s for that matter. When it became obvious that my chin was starting to look a little hairy, I first used my dad’s electric shaver. I remember it feeling like a layer of skin had been scraped off and it was sore for a while. Once I was doing this regularly it began to firm up and my dad went out and bought me my own shaver. I don’t think I had any great feelings either way about these events. It was no big deal, just part of growing up. Having an older brother and sister I think I was impatient to grow up and be able to do all the things they were doing that I was missing out on. I had read about these changes that were to come to my body. I think my mum had got me a couple of books from the library rather than having a sit-down talk about the ‘facts of life’ and that was fine by me. Growing Older I have always cycled to actively maintain my physical health. I cycled 3 miles to school and back for the whole of my secondary education. At Polytechnic it was my only means of getting around and there I would travel 4 miles from digs each day, or up to 10 miles to other student’s houses. My hobby is aviation, so I have often cycled from home to airports and airfields where I have lived similar distances from them. I cycled to and from work for a couple of years when I was near enough at one location, and I have always used my bicycle to do quick shopping trips or run errands like going to the post office, rather than use the car. Later in life, with having children and endlessly running them around in the car to activities I have cycled less. I am pleased to say they either walked or cycled to their schools right up to sixth form. It is only in recent years that I have begin to go out cycling just for that exercise in itself. With not doing it as regularly as I did when I was young, I can feel myself getting out of shape. I walk our dog each day and make myself do half or an hour’s cycling once a week. I am hoping to retire this year and with the extra time I shall endeavour to cycle more regularly. I want to keep a reasonable level of fitness and there aren’t any others that appeal to me. I enjoy covering distance, seeing the area I cycle round, and if there is an aim to it, be it an errand or airport, all the better. I am aware of my father’s demise from heart failure at the relatively young age of 70 and that drives me to look after my own in this way. As I get older maintaining my level of fitness, not at a sporting level, but at a comfortably able level is becoming more important. I would like to get back into countryside walking, I think. Unfortunately, my wife endures rheumatoid and osteoarthritis so walking any distance isn’t a feature of our lives together. I am very fortunate not to have suffered mental health problems, but I am very well aware that exercise is good for that. There have been many traumatic episodes in my family’s life and they have had their toll on my wife and daughter particularly. My emotional health has been impacted and I think it is important to differentiate between that and mental health. It may be just semantics, but I don’t think mental health and emotional health are the same thing. Looking after my family (at one time I was on suicide watch with my wife) was a great strain. When I spoke about it to my work manager, needing support, they could only think it terms of mental health. Was I depressed? No, I was just overwhelmed with stress, worry and anxiety. It was my emotions that were going through the shredder, not my ability to function mentally. I believe making a distinction between the two would encourage more men to talk about their feelings. Mental health still has a stigma attached despite all the progress in recent years. Depression is more often a clinical matter. Sometimes circumstances can lead to depression, but also there is the grey area of emotional health that shouldn’t be treated with medication, a shallower but similarly hampering state. Physical exercise certainly helped, but I found the wellbeing of my mind was aided by talking to friends, contemplation and just going out and doing things I enjoyed. There’s nothing better than talking to a good friend about your troubles, especially one who knows you well, is a good listener and knows your circumstances and where you are coming from. I have talked to a counsellor and it is a frustrating experience having to go over the details of everything that has happened so they can gain and understanding of what you are going through. Sometimes you just need someone to sit alongside you in silence and a good friend who can do that is all you need. Contemplation is immensely helpful too. I am a Christian (whatever that means, I’m still a work in progress), read the Bible and pray, following Jesus. In recent years I have come to understand the contemplative, reflective side of my faith. Prayer is less about asking for something to be done but identifying with others and framing yourself alongside them. It helps to put everything into context. You realise and accept that at many times in life order is broken down into disorder, then rebuilt or re-created anew, frequently for the better or stronger. It is a deep principle that you see reflected in a lot of counselling and wellbeing thought. Letting go and accepting sometimes is a powerful principle. I look back and see what my family has been through and we have all weathered a remarkable storm, and I believe our wellbeing is in part through our prayers, the prayers of other and the faithfulness of God. Sometimes it’s good just to go and do something you enjoy. Physical exercise plays a part in that, but I am just as happy and get just as much refreshment from mental stimulus. Walking my dog, listening to music, or walking my dog whilst listening to music are welcome breaks from the day’s routine or pressures. Best of all is a day out in my car driving to an airport like Heathrow to watch and photograph the planes. My mind is focussed on nothing but the task of photography, lighting conditions, being outdoors, checking the schedules and watching what is going on. When done with like-minded friends all the better. It is the all-consuming distraction that a busy mind needs to take your focus off things that cause worry, and I always feel better for a day out like that. As I get older I expect I shall be paying more attention to my physical health as already I can feel things creaking and bits starting to fall off. Unlike my father I don’t smoke, don’t drink nearly as much as he did, and I have been a vegetarian since my late teens. That choice was more on ethical reasons than health benefits, but it does no harm and must be healthier for me. I was positively dissuaded from smoking. We were all becoming aware of the health risks of that in the 1970’s and the tide had turned against acceptance of that as the norm. I am pleased to say I have never been tempted. Despite that he was a regular rambler all his life so I am mindful that I can’t neglect physical exercise. I can see myself needing to become more careful in the future. I have been blessed with good health all my life. I have never broken a bone, and only been in hospital once for a kidney stone. Apart from the occasional heavy cold (flu?) and succumbing to gastro-enteritis now and then, that’s been it. I know statistically something will crop up sooner or later. There’s not a lot I can do about that other than what I do now, so it is to be expected. I can feel myself being a little clumsier around the house. Slowing down and being more measured is something I am mindful I need to be so that I don’t trip over my slippers or the dog. I can feel perhaps the beginnings of arthritis in joints and I know how longer fractures take to heal as you get older. Basically, I don’t like hospitals and am a coward when it comes to pain so I intend to avoid both of those if I can! Cycling is perhaps the only worry here. Roads don’t get any quieter and I know my wife is concerned every time I go out. I am careful but there is no guarantee. Maybe I shall have to join her swimming. I did regularly swim for a few months while I was doing some intense training for my job. I was in temporary digs near a sports centre so each day I would go and swim lengths for half an hour or so. It was a bit boring to be honest, but I did need to stimulus of stretching and exercising to help me unwind. Health, wellbeing and appearance External appearance can be totally unrelated to what’s going on underneath. Many conditions are completely hidden, but I would generally say that weight is the first and main thing that relates to good health and wellbeing. Overweight people simply don’t look healthy in my opinion. Is there a direct correlation to size and physical health? There has to be a broad one, but in the case of my wife it is not quite so straightforward. She carries more weight than she should for her height and I put that down to her reduced mobility due to arthritis. However, she swims for at least 40 minutes most days and can cover a couple of miles when sea swimming. Her heart and lungs are probably in pretty good condition. I can’t help noticing smokers though. The yellowy-grey skin and hair. It doesn’t look a picture of health at all. I know some people who are physically very fit but sometimes you can see they are wracked with the pain of mental health, etched on their faces. I don’t think I have ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. I’m never going to grace the cover of GQ so why worry? My ideal woman was never the stick-thin pouty model-type if that is the popular choice. We all have our own likes and preferences and it sometimes surprises me by what someone sees in someone else. However, it is the person inside that counts most. I know many beautiful people of all shapes and sizes and I find that to be truer each day as I am heading towards celebrating my silver wedding anniversary. Our health and appearance may be in decline but that inner beauty becomes more and more apparent and important. I don’t think my parents were particularly influenced by these ideals. They were quite ordinary in appearance. Comfort was the main factor; their exercise was one for enjoyment rather than as a means to itself. I can’t think of any health or beauty products that I couldn’t live without. A quick squirt of deodorant under the armpits and I’m done. In the winter I always carry a lip salve in my pocket. Does brushing my teeth count as a health product? After half my mouth was filled with amalgam by the time I was 14 I decided I didn’t want any more of that and made sure I brushed regularly from then on. No fillings since! My desert Island item would be sunblock, of course. Getting ready to leave the house My father would use his electric shaver and splash on some Brut on his chin before going to work and that was it. I don’t recall my mother ever wearing make-up. Maybe some lipstick for a (rare) night out or for a wedding. She wasn’t one for eyeshadow or blusher, but for special occasions would always like to get her hair done nicely. My routine is much the same as described above. I pay only scant attention to my appearance other than looking neat and tidy. My hair and face are very low maintenance. I don’t even use after shave lotion. Wearing decent and comfortable clothes is more important, as is looking smart for special occasions where I go so far as to add a spray of scent. This hasn’t changed over time. I was never fussy as a teenager and only when I got into serious dating did I begin to use cologne."

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My response I am 71 years of age. I have underlying health problems: type 2 diabetes, a heart condition called AF and I am slightly overweight because I lead a sedentary lifestyle. Apart from these common conditions, I am healthy. When it comes to wellbeing I consider myself to be good, in ways that most people would find surprising -as I will explain in this response. Health to me, means the absence of any physical condition that has a negative impact on one's life. I mentioned above that I am slightly overweight. The negative consequence for me that arises from this is that it is a risk-factor. I have to take medication for my type-2 diabetes in order to reduce the risk of that condition either becoming worse or of killing me. My weight prevents me from eating and drinking some food products that are common place -such as cream cakes or sugary drinks and foods that are high in carbohydrates and fats. It is not that I never eat such things but that I consume them in moderation on rare occasions and have to compensate for this by several days of eating only very healthy foods. I was asked to share the first five words that came into my mind when I think of 'a healthy body.' These are: Painlessness Energy Sleep Relaxed Contentment In order to be clear why these words were chosen, let me explain them. Painlessness is being free from chronic pain or discomfort. Old age brings aches and pains and these are often related to the weather -such as changes in temperature or humidity. Chronic pain would include something such as toothache that is experienced over many days or even weeks. Energy refers to feeling one has enough vitality to get through the day as opposed to feeling constantly worn out or tired. There are some days when I feel more energetic than others. But overall, on average, I feel I have the kind of energy that I need in order to live the kind of lifestyle I choose. Sleep. I sleep more than I used to when I was working. I cannot get through the day without having a nap during the day. I take a snooze on the sofa and this usually is for an hour. I can do this. It does not interfere with my life in any way. Day-time sleeping benefits my life and wellbeing. Relaxed, as opposed to tense or anxious, is my normal state. I am largely stress free. There is little I need to feel anxious about. Contentment is a long-term feeling of being satisfied with one's condition in life. I am largely content with who I am, what I am, where I am and how I am. Not to be confused with being complacent. Or with being self-satisfied. It is a sate of being calm. I am relaxed about my life. Identity. I said I was 71 years old. I do not see myself as an old person. I do not feel old. I know I am officially elderly but I do not see myself as decrepit. I do not see myself as being very different from how I was ten years ago. I feel no obligation to act my age. I do not dress like an old man. If I look and behave like a middle-class white person then that is because I am a middle-class white person. I am happy with that. It presents no problem. I have completely abandoned 'sexual orientation' and see the idea of having a sexual orientation as being no longer relevant to one's lifestyle. I think it is an old-fashioned and outmoded psychologist's concept left over from its conception in the 1970s. Our society should let go of the notion of sexual orientation and let it fall into disuse along with a load of other legacy ideas inherited from the past. Our society should not need it any more. I would like to say the same for race but sadly we are nowhere near getting towards social colour-blindness. Oddly enough, this kind of thinking does not apply (in my case) to gender. I see myself as being a bloke. I am very content to live in a world of men and women, of males and females. I am very happy to accept that, for some individuals, gender can be transitional. No problem with that. When it comes to being male and masculine I am happy in my own skin. If other people change their gender then they should be free to do so. Those around should respect that it is their choice to decide on their own identity. They should not be disadvantaged as a result. I have always been healthy. I have never been in hospital, as a patient. I have never had a life-changing injury. I have never suffered from a chronic disease. I became aware of health much earlier than I became aware of the idea of wellbeing. In fact I can date my becoming aware of wellbeing as a concept because I happen to have got a job in a clinic where it was a term used every day. That was in 2010. The clinic where I worked (as an administrator) cared for people with a serious disease and those who supported patients talked about their wellbeing. That was when I first became conscious of wellbeing as a word and concept. The more I think about ideas such as health or wellbeing the less I understand them. Back in the 1970s, everyone talked about 'community' in an unthinking way. Social and public services were provided 'in the community.' It was a word that was plastered on everything. 'Community-this' and 'community-that.' Remember Thatcher's 'Community Charge?' Saying that something was 'community' was a deeply and intrinsically political act. Community was plastered on everything in order to make feel people it was OK ­warm and cuddly -whereas, in reality, what was really being done was to sugar the pill of cuts and rolling back the state of public services or, in some cases, increasing prices and costs. The government talked about caring for people with mental illnesses 'in the community.' That was done to make people feel that cutting mental health services was perfectly acceptable. We needed, it was said, to reduce dependency on psychiatric hospitals and to treat people in the community. It was a smokescreen for making cuts and doing nothing. Hence, I am wary about using the word 'wellbeing' as a political weapon. As a term, 'wellbeing' smacks of the same set of beliefs as 'community.' As an idea, it is more than just being well. When I was young, my parents were responsible for looking after me. I left home when I was 17 and became responsible for myself. Being responsible for looking after myself continued until I got married at the age of 33. Having a wife, we shared responsibility for health and being well as a family. That continued until 2003 when we were divorced. From then onwards I became self-sufficient. From 2003 to 2020 I have been on my own. No one looks after me now. I am solely responsible for keeping myself well. My parents had little or no concept of health and certainly never used the word 'wellbeing'. Back in the era of the 1950s, through to the 1960s, people talked only about illness. In the common tongue of those days, health was a synonym for fitness or for freedom from disease or illness. As a child I had chickenpox and possibly measles. I had to be taken to the dentist to have a tooth taken out. That was probably the extent of my parent's having to care for me in respect of illnesses. Conversations about health never took place, as far as I can remember. My parents inherited all the bad health habits from their parents. Sugar for example. My mother used to always put two spoonfuls of sugar in my tea. She sprinkled sugar over everything -including breakfast cereals. I never had a good teeth as a child. I suffered from tooth decay for most of my life because my mother liked sugar. She had been brought up in a sugary world. She had a sweet tooth and it never once occurred to her that sugar was a problem. Her generation was brought up on a sugary diet. Sugar -to them was as harmless as smoking. They probably both had pre-diabetes but I never knew for sure if this was the case and they never said anything to me about their blood sugar levels. Given their fondness for sugar I suspect they both had diabetic conditions but these were either never diagnosed or if they were they never said anything to me about it. My own diabetes was not diagnosed until I was well into my sixties. I do not recall my mother having to take medications for diabetes. She died at the age of 82. Both my parents smoked all day, every day. I remember that when my parents were in their sixties they both had all their teeth removed and had to wear dentures. That was the accepted practice. It meant that people no longer had to worry about the cost of dentistry. It was the accepted medical mantra that people of a certain age should have all their teeth removed. Even today, the removal of all the teeth is still being recommended to people above a certain age. It is something I have refused and will always refuse for as long as I can. My parent's acceptance of sugar as being healthy and not something to be avoided was handed on to me and continued well into my adult life until medical science began to see it as being a problem. I was probably in my fifties when I stopped adding sugar to my tea and coffee. I went to a secondary modern school where I received a secondary education. Health was a minor part of the biology curriculum. We were all forced to take part in PE (physical education.) Once a year, a nurse looked at us. Her main concern was to see if we had infestations (such as lice or verrucas.) One or two of the boys at my school were obese but most were of normal build for their age. There was no sex education. Workingclass boys, in the 1950s and early -60s, were usually fit and not overweight and lived a healthy life eating mainly good foods. All that changed after I left school in 1965 when the food industry gave us fast foods, high-fat and sugary food products and drinks and supermarkets. Televisions came into every home and subjected the whole population to advertising profitable foods that were (as we now know) unhealthy. I learned to cook at an early age. When I lived on my own (from the age of 17) I ate well. I do not recall ever being hungry for long. During my teenage years and up to the time when I went to University, I was in almost continuous employment. Some of the jobs I had (when I was a teenager) were in hotels and restaurants where food was provided as part of the job. When I lived and worked in London I was always well fed and ate well. I also had a job where I was constantly running around and so I did not become fat. As an undergraduate, I ate well and, when not living in hall, was able to cook both for myself and for my friends. My undergraduate diaries are full of references to me holding dinner parties. Our university had an excellent student health service. In those days I smoked a lot and drank heavily, worked excessively and slept poorly. I had 'colds' on a regular basis. Lifestyle 'colds.' Cigarettes and beer took their toll on my health. But I could not have got through the pressures of university life without them. After I left university, in 1975, my lifestyle continued in much the same way as I struggled with demanding careers and high-pressure jobs. I continued to suffer from poor sleep, tiredness and coughs and sore throats. It was not until I stopped smoking tobacco that I became free of these problems. I remember running marathons during the years when jogging was all the rage and nearly everyone did it. In those days the streets were full of people jogging. I think that was in the 1980s. I learned to drive and spent a lot of my time sitting in a car travelling around the country every week as part of my work. When not driving, I was sitting in offices attending meetings and conferences. Two decades of leading a sedentary lifestyle. I also enjoyed swimming and playing badminton. It was not until I retired that I started to become overweight. I ran my own business and spent all day in a chair at a computer keyboard. There was little opportunity, during the day, to go out for a walk or do some cycling to keep fit. Gyms were nearby but they were expensive and I felt unable to take advantage of them. Adolescence Looking back at my adolescence, I probably noticed that I was going through puberty when I was ten or eleven. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was not something we were taught in school. I started to shave when I was 16. That was after I had left school and started going to work. I had to look smart and well presented. Beards or other types of facial hair were prohibited in my line of work. It was not until I was an undergraduate I grew a beard and had long hair. At the time, being hairy was an obligation. I cannot remember my voice breaking when I was a teenager. I probably understood a little about such things because I was a self-taught scientist. I was interested in medicine and human anatomy from an early age. I loved watching surgery and operations being broadcast live, in great detail, on the television. As an undergraduate I studied social sciences and took a special interest in human sexual behaviour. In the 1970s, sociology began to be influenced by the growth of the women's movement and feminism. It was also the era of the rise of gay liberation. And anti-racism. These issues made sociology more interesting. Life as a student offered many moments of self-realisation and constant concern with social change and protest movements. Students began to adopt rituals focused on gender. We became used to talking about 'he and she', 'men and women' and ''his or hers.' As I child, I grew up using the masculine gender to also include the feminine gender. We talked about men as a term that also included women. With the rise of feminism that had to stop. It was no longer a man's world. We began to accept that men and women were (or should be) equal. We also began to accept that people were either straight or gay and that in either case they should not be discriminated against. Our way of talking and our attitudes had to be politically correct and believed that everyone had equal rights. Men urged women to burn their bras and some of them actually did. I lapped this up. It appealed to my political, moral and ethical perspective on life. Some men dressed in women's clothes in order to make a statement about the patriarchal nature of society. Being masculine was frowned on. Men were allowed to be affectionate towards each other. Blokes were allowed to express emotions. The stiff upper lip of British society was dismantled. We left the 1970s and entered a brave new world of social attitudes that was markedly different to that of our parents. I never became a radical in my behaviour because my career was in formal settings where such things would been unacceptable. Privately, I could have discussions with women and men that pivoted on our acceptance of anti-sexism. I was popular with women because I portrayed the 'new man.' Sensitive, emotional and caring. Sharing child care. Changing nappies. Cooking. Helping with the cleaning. Treating women with respect and not patronising them. We actually had conversations about periods and feminine hygiene. Something forbidden to our parents. Men might have joked about women having periods but this was utterly alien to our parent's generation. I worked as a volunteer in the youth service. I remember when we gave working-class teenagers lessons in sex. In doing this, we talked about body parts using the same words the young people themselves used. We taught sexuality as it was and did not dress it up in the terminology of bourgeois liberals who used elaborated words borrowed from medical science. We were a bunch of highly educated liberal progressives who wanted to help disadvantaged young people from poor working-class backgrounds. We were the sons and daughters of the sexual revolution of the 1970s. Growing older I retired when I was 65 and began to receive a state pension. That was a rite of passage. When I was an adolescent I had my fair share of depression -the kind of Sturm und Drang that was and probably still is typical of the middle to late teenage years. Between the time that I started at secondary school, in 1960, and when I left, in 1965, I had a troubled adolescence. I now think of this as my emo era. I received no help for this. None was available. Children's counselling and psychology services were in their infancy and were used almost exclusively by the middle-classes where parents understood the needs of teenagers and were determined to get help where it was needed. As I said before, I left home when I was 17. I moved from my childhood home to London and that was with the permission of my parents. I learned to become independent and self-reliant. It was the best thing I ever did. Life in London was not without its problems but I coped with these and worked hard and gained a place at University. Something not done by any of my childhood peers. I am not convinced that I actively maintained my own health. Ideas about a healthy lifestyle did not really seep down into the British world until the 1990s when we had the rise in running and jogging and the smoking ban and an obsession with eating healthy foods. I remember when television celebrity chefs started to talk about healthy foods and show how people could eat well for less. Gone were the fads of the 1960s and 70s -people started to throw out their old chip pans and pots filled with cheese or oil into which you dipped skewers of meat and vegetables. Landfill sites began to receive hundreds of disused fondue sets. Instead people bought quiche trays by the hundreds.  We stopped frying things in lard and went over to vegetable oils. Supermarkets began to fill up with healthy low-fat alternatives. Advertising and marketing people filled our television screens with foods that were healthy. The TV channels were full of women in Lycra leotards demonstrating aerobics to music. Even men did it. Remember the horrors of Mr. Motivator? All of this came at a time when I was unable to be influenced by it because I spent all my working days either sitting in a driving seat, at a desk or on a conference chair. In the 1970s, running began to boom in the UK. Even I watched the London Marathons on the television. Britain began to see the rise of fitness gyms. I never went to a gym. I either never had time for such things or could not afford it. Running in the street was cheap and you could do it whenever you had the time. Jogging helped me to give up smoking. At first there was nothing better than having a fag as soon as you got home from running. In the 1990s, I worked in local government and my council had a health clinic that offered free courses to people who wanted to give up smoking. I went to one of their group sessions and gave up smoking. That lasted for ten years during which time I never smoked a single cigarette. One night I went out clubbing with a mate and he offered me a fag. By then I was so drunk I accepted it. From then on, I continued to smoke tobacco until about three years ago when I stopped buying tobacco and took up vaping. Which I still do. I do however still enjoy the occasional cigar at special times, such as after Christmas dinner. My fitness regime, during the lockdowns, has been limited to walking in the park. When it is not raining. I do not go out in the rain. Never. People keep telling me I look much younger than I am. Part of this might have been due to getting involved in rock music. I began to attend rock music gigs from 2002 onwards. The bands that played at these events largely comprised teenagers and men in their early twenties. So, from my early fifties, I became a live music aficionado and for several years went out to gigs nearly every night of the week. Most of my friends were men half my age. Gradually that way of life reduced until the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March 2020 when all the venues had to close. But, being a rock fan helped me to avoid the worse excesses of growing older. When I went to gigs, to see bands or rappers, I dressed the part. I wore a hoody and a baseball cap. People thought I was joking when I said I was in my fifties or sixties. I had to explain to them that when I was born, King George VI was on the throne. They had known only one monarch throughout their entire lives ­Queen Elizabeth. Now I seem to be venerated as a kind of elder statesman of the punk and metal scene. One of the advantages of the COVID restrictions is that we now have be seated for rock concerts. I find it hard to stand up for any length of time. A couple of years ago I went to my last outdoors rock festival. No more festivals for me. I simply can't do it any more. To sum up, I am growing old disgracefully. I have no role model in my head for what an elderly man should be like. My ancestors were expected to act their age and to live a life suited to a certain age group. That no longer applies. I think this might be why so many people now live to be one hundred or more -it's not just about the NHS keeping people alive -society has forgotten how to be old. People live longer because they have more life in them. My forbears lived in a world which expected people to die before they were four score years and ten. Elderly people were expected to behave in a certain way and become decrepit if they survived beyond sixty. Most of them dutifully obliged. Getting ready to leave the house My parents occasionally went out for an evening, leaving me at home. I know this because I have black and white photos of them attending formal functions, dressed up in their very best clothes. These photos were probably taken before I was born. When I was a toddler, we had one of the first televisions and my parents tended to stay at home and did not go out much. If I was taken out -to attend a wedding for example -I would be dressed in my best clothes and great pains were taken to ensure that my face and hands were clean and my hair carefully brushed and combed. If my parents engaged in rituals at the time of going out, I was unaware of it, being too young to appreciate that such things happened. When I became a young teenager, I saw my father heading off to the local pub. He did not make any preparations for such outings and did not dress for the occasion. By that time the whole family had gone downhill and deteriorated into slovenlyness. Not my mother, of course. She continued to work as a waitress into her mid-seventies. Her work required her to be smartly turned out. My father wore a uniform -that of a naval officer who was required to observe certain standards of dress and appearance. As a child of primary school age, the only times I can remember my parents going out was when they went to the local public house, just up the road from where we lived. No photos exist of those outings but I know, from having seen old films from the 1950s, that men wore ties and women always wore some kind of hat. The pub crowd was informal but not untidy. That lifestyle changed when we moved house (to another part of town) and I started to go to secondary school. From 1960 onwards, my parents rarely ever went out, at least, not as a couple. My mother worked in the evenings and one adult had to remain at home to look after the young members of the family. But when I went out, when I was a teenager, I paid great attention to my appearance and dressed as best I could in the clothes that I could afford. Going out was a ritualistic experience and it was essential that great attention was paid to one's appearance. When I lived in London, I mixed with society and had to have a range of different styles of clothing to suit the varied occasions I had to attend -from white bow ties and black tailcoats for formal dinners through to jeans and T-Shirts for drunken parties of the bohemian set. When I started work (in 1965) I had to be smartly dressed. Being an office worker, it was beholden on me to wear a three-piece suit. I remember my very first suit -I had it made at a tailors. I think I looked very smart in it. My hair was always carefully combed and cut to an appropriate length -short. My first three jobs were in the legal profession. Smart appearance was de rigueur. After I abandoned that career, I went to work in a travel agency where I served the public. That demanded crisp white shirts and sensible ties. Sometimes I wore a jacket -only the upper half of me was visible to the customers. In London I led a very active social life. That continued when I was an undergraduate at university. When I moved to my present town, in the mid-seventies, I continued to spend most of my evenings out but that was attending political party meetings and committees, more so than social events. Jumping a few decades -now in the Covidian era -social life has all but disappeared. Selfisolation has prevented me going out unless it is necessary. When I have to leave the house, these days, it involves a complex series of procedures that must be planned well in advance. I have a written list of all the things I must take with me before I can shut the front door. From bus passes to face coverings. Before I leave the house, I engage in one specific ritual -I always tell the cat that I am going out. I say the words, 'see you later, cattygator.' She cannot understand human speech, but she seems to get what is happening. You can tell by the look on her face. In future years... I see a time when people stop pontificating about that  meaningless word -wellbeing. My forbears used to greet each other with the words, 'Hello. How are you? Are you well?' There was a standard set of responses. These varied with age. Back in that day, people were either well or sick. Elderly people used to engage in protracted conversations about their illnesses and complaints. It was an expected ritual. We now have a national health service that deals mainly with being ill. I was born in an NHS hospital. Health has become the new illness. This change in language has become most evident in terms of mental illness. It is now no longer acceptable to used words such as 'mad', 'insane' or to refer to people as 'lunatics' or being 'bonkers.'  People now experience mental health issues. We are now all expected to be happy but no one has ever been able to define what that is. People are quite capable of explaining what it is to be unhappy -to be stressed, depressed or experiencing anxiety. During the lockdown of 2020, stress, loneliness and anxiety became widespread as people were denied access to their loved ones and forced to isolate from their normal methods of socialising. Those who ignored the rules of distancing caught coronavirus and became sick or passed it on to their families. Early in 2020, I did a number of courses in coronavirus pandemic management. Out of my own interest. I wrote extensively about the epidemic in this country and around the world. It was, after all, the thing that dominated British life in the post-Brexit era. My knowledge of the virus and the illness it caused went far beyond that of the ordinary person. I might have carried the coronavirus asymptomatically but I have never became ill from it (touches wood.) People will continue to give a high priority to their health and marketing and advertising will ensure that we are not permitted to forget that we must all consume products that contribute to our health and wellbeing. Even after the vaccine has taken effect, we will continue to live in the new normal of a virus-threatened world. We might have faced the coronavirus in 2020 but from next year the world will face new viruses. We will have to adapt to a new normal approach to staying free from disease. As global warming changes our physical environment, we will all face new challenges. Most of the population, in this country, has now become risk averse. Gone is the carefree life that we have enjoyed since the end of the second world war and the foundation of the NHS. Global migration of people has posed a whole new set of threats to our health and wellbeing. As sea levels rise, that will get even worse. My prediction is that, in post-Covidian life, the term 'wellbeing' will fall into disuse and be replaced by more cogent words or phrases to denote how we feel about ourselves and the lives we lead.

A definition of well-being: a sense of well-being springs from the possession of a healthy body and mind, safe in the knowledge that all is well with the world. Images of a healthy body: good physique (in a man); well-proportioned figure (in a woman); not obese; good skin tone; clean, managed hair. Growing Up and Learning about Health and Well-being I have no idea when I became aware of personal health and well-being. My parents took all responsibility for looking after my health and well-being.  This was exemplified by their care when I suffered bouts of bronchitis during the winter.  The house was so cold that my parents were advised to bring my bed into the relative warmth of the living room, where there was an open fire.  Later, arrangements were made for him and me to sit in my uncle’s bedroom before a sun-ray lamp for up to half an hour.  However, my parents never discussed the reason why artificial sun rays were beneficial.  I remember being annoyed because the sun ray treatment coincided with Radio Luxembourg’s programme ‘Dan Dare’ between 7pm and 7.30pm. At secondary school, any attempt at informing pupils about cleanliness and oral health was sabotaged by pupils asking for information about sexual matters. The harassed female teacher, flushed and flustered, tried her best to avoid subjects related to sex.  Needless to say, I learned nothing in her lessons. Key Moments At the age of 12 or 13, I discovered the pleasure of masturbation. I discovered that ejaculation accompanied an orgasm. In my first years in employment (I was an apprentice in the 1950s), my attention was drawn to certain office girls, and whilst thinking about them, masturbation at home continued on a regular basis. W3176 If my voice broke I am not aware of when this occurred. I had observed the daily ritual of my father shaving.  I was fifteen years old when my inchoate beard and moustache was noticed by my mother who insisted that I shaved my face.  My mother regarded my unshaven face as a distinct put-off by prospective employers.  Shaving became part of growing up to be an adult. I didn’t like the occasional cut on my chin or cheek. Growing Older I have always eschewed gymnasium and keep-fit facilities.  I discovered hill walking in my early thirties and this became regular activity, either alone or with my wife and with friends. This activity came to an end in my fifties, although I cannot point to any particular reason.  Thereafter, I walked along canal towpaths and disused railway tracks. In this way I had exercise, though this was not the reason for walking in hill country. I simply loved finding isolated places untrodden by others; hence the reason why I avoided the Lake District, where too many boots tread the same path at the same time. I studied music – specifically four-part harmony for many years.  In this pursuit I was an autodidact. I also studied geology – again self-taught. Before I retired, I began a writing career based upon British railway history.  This I still do. I have always kept my brain active, one way or another.  I have always been aware of a healthy body and mind.  I don’t smoke. I drink very occasionally. Information about health and well-being is obtained from articles in the Daily Mail, the British Heart Foundation magazine, and similar sources.  I am fully aware of my body nowadays, mainly because I have Parkinson’s Disease, a condition I live with and manage with medication. The limitations imposed by Parkinson’s frustrate me. Health, Well-being and Appearance A healthy person exhibits energy and enthusiasm for the world he or she lives in.   On the other hand, an unhealthy person lacks enthusiasm and is depressed by his or her inability to enjoy life fully. W3176 I have never been influenced by popular ideals of masculinity or physical prowess. A good diet, no overeating, and regular exercise, have combined to produce a healthy body (no beer belly). Getting ready to leave the house I remember my father shaving with a safety razor. He was too modest to dress or undress in front of me.  My mother applied cosmetics and combed her hair in my presence before we ventured out to see my grandparents. I was about ten at the time. I also witnessed my parents before they attended a Saturday evening dance at the local Conservative club.  Politically, both were staunch Labourites, but that was subsumed under my mother’s desire to be glamorous and able to dance.  Despite incessant smoking, (my father a pipe and my mother cigarettes), both enjoyed good physical and mental health."

I have never had a lung infection that bad, and at one point Ithought I’d be left with permanent lung damage. Fortunately I recovered well, although I do still have tired days. This experience meant that Iwasn’t scared ofcatching Covid19 as I may have already had it – however I was annoyed there was no way of finding out, as there was no testing for the general public. In terms of mentalhealth, I alreadyhave a ‘mentalhealth toolkit’ as I amprone to depression, so I continued life as usual, making sure I exercised regularly, ate and slept well, kept to a routine, contacted friends regularly etc. My pets are a reason to get out of bed every morning, I have not had a day without getting dressed, have not massively overeaten, and have had no severe anxiety. In fact, to alarge extent, lockdown suits me as I don’t have the pressures to be social and the stress of keeping a public life going. I have needed no medical or professional help. I attended a dental appointment for repair of a broken filling plus X-rays the day before lockdown took effect;I told themI’d done 2 weeks in self-isolation and was now symptom-free, they were happy for me to come in, and I was comfortable with their hygiene precautions. I’mglad I did, given how long this has gone on for… initially wewere told 3 weeks, then extended another 3 weeks. I have had the feeling since the start that this would go on a lot longer than people expect, having followed the science news since January and read about what was happening in other countries. My emotions have been up and down. Days of perfect contentment, in the garden, in the sunshine, hearing birdsong, knowing that nature has a chance to recover, quiet streets, long walks, people caring for each other in local communities; but also days when it was an effort to get out of bed, nights when it was hard to get to sleep and/or I woke several times, anxiety dreams often involving travel, general grumpiness and unsociability, bad and sore tummy, lethargy. Catching myselfgoing down the routeof‘I’museless’ and changing direction quickly (been there too many times in my life already). Some anxiety about the future, more along the lines of ‘what should I be doing in the next few years’ rather than ‘is this Armageddon/zombie apocalypse’! The Government Have made an almighty balls-up of the whole affair, on top of the criminal policies of previous Tory administrations! Ideologically-driven decisions, along the lines of keep the country open for business (untilit’s too late to contain the outbreak), U-turns, the realisation that the NHS is the lynchpin after so many years of underinvestment, running it down and privatising-by-stealth… So many lives lost unnecessarily, I amashamed of our country. Too little, too late, bluster, obfuscation, Boris Johnson and his administration are totally out of their depth in the crisis. I see the measured and calm leadership in other countries and despair. In the coming months, sadly, I see more of the same. Partial easing of the lockdown is starting to occur as of this week, but the message is confusing and the other countries of the Union are having none ofit. ‘Be alert’? I have no faith that we will avert a second and potentially much larger spike in cases and deaths. I am very concerned that BME people and poorer people are bearing the brunt of this. The working class are once again merely cannon fodder. All I can hope for is that the Tories are removed sooner rather than later and that the next Government, be it Labour or some sort of coalition, listen to all the sciences properly and rebuild with people and the planet in mind, not making money for big business and shareholders. We have the opportunity now to re-green the economy and make it work for all, not a very few at the top. I can only hope we take it. News I sometimes watch BBC News at 6; I sometimes buy an i newspaper; I get my science news from New Scientist, which I read on my tablet every week via a library app, and from other forward-looking science email newsletters. Sometimes I click on reports that appear in my Facebook newsfeed, eg Guardian articles posted by others, but several news sources overall. I avoid the Right Wing press even on newsfeed though. I have not been watching the daily government press broadcasts at 5pm, relying on clips on the 6pm news rather than have to endure Raab and Johnson taking the stage fully. I have not experienced any challenges with access to the news and don’t know anyone who has. I was impressed withNicola Sturgeon’s briefings and think sign language interpreters are a good thing in general. More inclusivity! Work and home life I have two sources of income from paid work normally, one of which has continued and the other came to an end before lockdown but can’t be restartedwhile all this is going on. The one that has continued is my part-time work as PA/Carer for a man with autism who gets Direct Payments to employ me. He is very anxious about the pandemic and is taking extreme measures to avoid infection. I am in contact withhimdaily, keeping up our ‘coffee dates’ on Tuesday by phone, and I get shopping for him once a week and deliver it to his house, using disposable gloves and keeping my distance. If the weather is OK we then walk his dog round nearby fields, physically distanced. He heard from the Agency or Social Services that he was to continue paying me as usual even if the hours had to drop due to the crisis, so that is a relief for both of us. However, it is not enough to live on. I am very fortunate that I have some savings to fall back on. My major source of income is as a Supported Lodgings Provider for Somerset County Council Social Services, for teenagers leaving care. My most recent placement came to an end in February, meanwhile my youngest daughter returned from studying in the Netherlands while she was applying for MA courses and finding work placements, and she started doing some temporary agency work until the first placement started. She was due to be working with Youth Empowerment schemes in Bulgaria starting in April. Meanwhile I was going to do major redecoration and work internal to the house before my next lodger placement. All that has fallen apart. Daughter’s work closed down and she had to sign on, but has not yet received any money, so I’ve been supporting her financially. She has applied to do online TEFL workbut there were manyhoops to jump through and that hasn’t started yet. No workmen will enter the house so nothing moving on the home improvement front. And daughter is stuck here indefinitely, in the bedroom I intend to use for lodgers. I miss my grandsons the most. I was a regular carer for them before this hit – they are both pre-school and the youngest is not yet talking, so it is hard. Ican’t see themat a distance as they don’t really understand whyI won’t come near them. We do video chats, at least. My son and his girlfriend are in Bristol; I am fortunate that I have one at home, at least, totally by fluke. Otherwise she would have been in the Netherlands, possibly without an income. We get on fine in the house, both fairly easy-going and we keep to our own rooms a fair bit. Technology I watched friends setting up Zoom to do online classes and meetings, but didn’t feelI had to initially. I did an online attempt at singing with members of one of my choirs for a birthday gig we’d had to cancelin April, but it didn’t work – for that I used mydaughter’s laptop and she set it up. Now however I need to set up Zoom on my laptop for a committee meeting for my other choir, which is tomorrow. We did a practice last week to make sure we could all access it. I’m not comfortable with online meetings or technology in general, although I can get used to it fairly quickly if I have to. However, I do use Messenger on my phone, both video calls and for voice-only calls, to see family and occasionally one friend. I have returned to actual letter-writing, especially initially, and written to distant friends and one in Australia and phoned old friendsI’ve not seen for a long time including an ex-boyfriend. I use Facebook but not Twitter or WhatsApp. I find myself scrolling the newsfeed several times a day, to keep up with locals and get reports from elsewhere in the country. In many ways it is a comforting ‘bubble’ ofpeople who agree with me or share a similar outlook, but I am aware of a lot of fallings-out and polarisation occurring. De-friending is trending… Shopping and food I have not bought any food online. I do a shop once a week, for myself, a neighbour who is self-isolating and my employer/client. My daughter comes with me and also shops for another self-isolating friend. That makes the supermarket experience into a bit of a challenge as we both have lists and need to find items which are unusual to us. The local Morrisons has been fine most weeks, flour is still rare but no shortage of fresh vegetables and fruit and most other items after the initial toilet roll rush. Whether there is a queue to get in depends on time of day, and people are all complying with distancing rules inside and to reach the check-outs. One week I attempted Tesco’s for my employer, and it was a horrible experience, not to be repeated. Long queues to get in, a strict one-way policy and long queues to get out, all the while ‘public service’-style announcements adding to my stress with a flavour of doom. I have a neighbour who shops at Aldi, also local, so she gets anything I particularly want from there. I know many neighbours and we look out for each other, swapping savoury dishes and cakes. There is a corner shop up the road which I use occasionally – for the newspaper, milk if I run out, and their discounted fruit and veg. There is also a farm-shop-type stall on the road near the bypass, within walking distance for local milk, eggs, butter, cheese etc, and I drive by on my way to the supermarket to pick up bags of compost for my seedlings. The Co­op on the High Street is also walking distance – I have only had to use it once when the corner shop had no newspaper, but I did find white bread flour there which another friend was desperate for. We are a small town in a rural area. Neighbours have allotments. People keep chickens. We won’t be short offood. My cooking and eating habits have changed because a) daughter is at home and likes to cook, and b) neighbours drop food in as a way of keeping in touch. I am eating more cake than usual! Other daughter has also been baking regularly and we do doorstep swaps, seedlings/clothes/cakes etc. Entertainment and leisure I stilldon’t watch muchTV, and ifI do it is alwaysBBC iPlayer. I have radio 3 on a lot and have once forayed into radio 4 territory. I have kept up my language learning on the Duolingo app on my tablet – started before this struck, Greek, Dutch and Spanish. I try to do some lessons every late afternoon or evening but will sometimes miss a day. I read and do Sudoku and have done a lot more gardening than usual. I read magazines on my tablet through a library app, New Scientist every week, and monthly BBC Wildlife, BBC History, BBC Science Focus, National Geographic, and occasionally others. Once a week I read the i newspaper. A neighbour drops in old copies of LRB for my animals’ bedding and I willalways read them first. I do sudoku from a book of them in bed when I wake up and as I go to sleep, and sometimes but not often during the day (usually the ones in the newspaper or free publications that come through the door) – I find it soothing, part of my stress relief. I have been listening to my old LPs some days, the turntable is a fairly recent acquisition so I still have a lot to work through after many years of them being stuck in the attic. I text or phone friends regularly. I go for a walk every day, sometimes over an hour but generally 20 mins to half an hour. I have done some unaccustomed cleaning, but not enough. Starting off seeds and repotting seedlings, hardening them off, planting some out, has kept me amused more than usual, also weeding, mowing, animal care (guinea pigs and quail). I have also done kitting, lots of overdue clothes mending, and some tapestry. I exercise at home some days, probably not often enough. Before, I went to a gym and attended yoga classes once or twice a week. I’ve not wanted to do Zoom yoga. Ido some weights exercises and some jogging around the house, but my main exercise is my daily walks or digging beds for vegetables/weeding. Once I went for a bike ride after my daughter (or rather, me) bought a second-hand bike, I aim to do this again. In terms ofTV, I’ve been watching Killing Eve, end of series 2 and all of series 3 so far; Primates, a new wildlife series, waiting for the next episode; started In My Skin but given up after 4 episodes I think; Back to Life; series 3 of The A Word. Initially I was watching BBC news at 6everynight, but now it’s occasional. I don’t watchTV everyevening, probably no more than 3-4 nights a week. I don’t listen to podcasts. Ialways have radio 3 Breakfast on from 7.30-8.30 with my alarm, sometimes I continue with it, also the afternoon or weekend shows. I like background classical music and familiar voices. I read a lot of novels and some non-fiction, depending on what I find or what neighbours lend me. The main one to note is HilaryMantel’s The Mirror and the Light, the 3rd from her Wolf Hall trilogy, which took me over 2 weeks to read. I like literary fiction and historical detective novels but will read a wide range of material. Personal hygiene I have kept to a fairly strict routine, not much different to everyday life before this. A shower and wash hair every third day; clean teeth twice a day; moisturise every morning. I started to wear make-up when I went out in the initial weeks, unusually, but have dropped that now. I get up and get dressed every day, although getting dressed is sometimes later – it is now after 10am and I am typing in my pyjamas, for example, but I will get dressed as soon as daughter is out of the bath… I don’t miss haircuts or personalcare appointments as I rarelydid them anyway. Hair gets trimmed twice a year usually, Iwear it long and curlyor tied back if it’s in the way. Sleep I do not have insomnia or nightmares, but I have been waking up in the night more often, have been taking much longer to get to sleep sometimes, and have been finding it harder to wake up and get moving at times, with more vivid and narrative dreams often including elements of travel, of anxiety, of people I know who died, of childhood scenes and places and of current events, all mixed up together. For example this morning I dreamt that I was pregnant with my ex-boyfriend’s child but in atime ofCovid19 (I amseveralyears post-menopausal)."

I suppose that I have the time to now, as before I always seemed to have mountains of things to think about, what with work demands, supporting a busy husband and bringing up four children. We also had a period when there were frequent house moves and re-locations, something which brought their own challenges. I would define health as being the physical condition of the mind and body and wellbeing as being the state of that mind and body.  If you care for your health and mental health then you should adopt a process of care (or wellbeing) to ensure that good health is maintained. So what is a healthy body?  I have thought about this a great deal in the past three years as I was diagnosed as Type 2 diabetic around ten years ago, but it took a long time for me to both understand the condition and to take active steps to manage it.  Work and other life events intervened, and I coped with it without really dealing with it.  I was obese and totally failed to manage my diet. I just ate what I wanted when I wanted. In other words, I didn’t take my health seriously at all. However, when it gets to the point when you can’t wipe your own arse because you’re too fat it is time to take stock.  I looked and felt fat. I began to suffer from other health conditions, such as back and knee problems too.  I took hardly any exercise and was often out of breath if I had to walk a distance.  My dress size was a 22 and I just looked like a little round tub of lard.  I wasn’t proud of this, but I didn’t have the self-discipline to do anything about it. Five words relating to health: . Fitness . Contentment . Energy . Appearance . Self-worth When I was unfit my self esteem was really low and my body image was poor too.  I still feel very self-conscious when I look at myself in the mirror, often concentrating upon the bits that I don’t like rather than the parts of me that look good. I don’t like to spend time in thinking about a particular person to whom I can aspire. I just want to be me, and I want to be a healthy me.  I look at some ageing personalities and feel sad that they’ve obviously had treatment of some sort.  You can tell by the way that their face appears to be stuck K7522 with no apparent ability to move a muscle. They look a little like wooden puppets.  There is a lot to be said for growing old gracefully. I still have some way to go but I believe that I’m getting there.  Now I can go into shops and look at clothes for a size 16.  I still want to do better than that but at least I now know that I can reach my goal.  In the past year I have lost two and a half stone and I’m aiming for further weight loss in the coming year. I am no longer obese, but I am overweight.  My general health has improved as a result.  I walk at least three miles a day and usually more without any concerns.  In fact, walking is one of the great enjoyments of my life, especially if we go out to a rural location and I can enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. It is good for both my mind and my body and I always return home with the feeling that it has been worthwhile. When I was younger I spent a great deal of time in playing sport. I was never still and right up until the time that I had my first child, aged twenty-eight, I engaged in sport of one sort or another.  After my first baby arrived that more or less stopped totally.  There were very few activities then for women at home to participate in.  My eldest daughter has just had her second child and she participates in things such as yoga and swimming.  There was very little such as that available for me and, anyway, money was tight, and I couldn’t afford to do much. As a child my family was large (five children), and the budget was limited.  Good wholesome family food was the norm but not all of it was what we would now regard as healthy. Mum regarded food (and plenty of it) as being essential and I suspect that nowadays the sort of things which we ate would be frowned upon by some.  It is only recently that I have paid much attention to what I eat and consider whether it is all right for me. The volumes eaten were also much bigger than they needed to be.  The essence was to have full plates followed by (over) full bellies. I remember having a few sessions at school at which we discussed food and its value as well as the dangers of smoking.  My parents were both heavy smokers but none of their five children smoke at all, which is interesting. This was at about the time when the dangers of lung cancer being caused by smoking were brought into prominence. I remember waking up one night when I was around thirteen and finding that I was bleeding. I went into my mother’s room and told her, and she shot out of bed and provided a sanitary towel.  But nothing was explained as such. I knew that I was having my first period and that meant that I could now have babies but that was about it. Mum was more concerned with the practicalities of the event than the causes, so it was all about keeping yourself clean and dealing with the physical side. The big fear for all girls at our school (a small girls grammar school) was of getting pregnant. The Headmistress gave us advice about our behaviour, and we were certainly advised about how we should conclude an evening when we went out with a boy. We were to shake hands and thank them for a lovely evening.  Needless to say not many of us bothered to follow that advice. When my sister and I got our first bra ( we were twins) I remember my dad speaking with a man who delivered eggs to our house and explaining that we were walking around with our arms folded across our chest because we were so self-conscious. I was mortified, although I can laugh about it now. K7522 After I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 I participated in various exercises designed to complement the treatment of chemo and radiotherapy.  These were designed to provide a mental health benefit to cope with the strains of undergoing the treatment which was often unpleasant and difficult.  I wasn’t always convinced, to be honest, of their benefit but it was interesting to experience the options. Some I liked and others felt less convincing. After a couple of years I also had CBT counselling which helped me to explore and understand the impact which the treatment had had upon my mental health. I was dealing with various significant life changes at the time and I needed to understand my loss of confidence and my resentment at the hand which life had dealt me. Understanding it and then putting those lessons into practice was far more difficult.  I was searching for peace of mind and it simply wasn’t there.  I had constant feelings of doom, even when things were good. There was, I considered, bound to be a shitstorm waiting just around the corner to descend upon me.  The interesting thing was that I recognised over a period of time that my mother had the same approach to life and that I was behaving just as she had when it came to dealing with (and living ) my life.  I am gradually getting to grips with that and seeing it for what it is but there are still times when I experience massive anxieties around forthcoming situations, and they can sometimes be in terms of the most trivial things. I know what is happening and I recognise it for what it is but stopping it occurring in the first place has never seemed possible. As I am type 2 I am in regular touch with a nurse at my GP and we are working on a plan to reduce my sugar levels and maintain my fitness through diet and exercise. I have twice-yearly checks at which my weight and bloods are checked, and we discuss possible actions to improve my health.  I should say at this point that the initial action to instigate the plan was from me. I wanted to do it and she has helped me in order to identify positive action to improve my overall health. I found out about the low-calorie approach developed by Professor Roy Taylor of Newcastle and how it lowered levels to the extent that Type 2 diabetes can be managed and maybe even overcome altogether.  I reduced my calories to around 800 a day for some two months and since then have followed a careful diet, avoiding foods with high levels of sugar. My husband has joined me in this regime and, if anything, is now even more passionate about it than I am. I now think of cake as being the occasional treat and not the norm.  I’ve got to like wholemeal bread and I’ve learnt more about recipes and potentials, experimenting more with new flavours and tastes.  I still find myself looking at cookery programmes on the tele and stating that I couldn’t possibly cook that as it is loaded with sugar. I know that when I am fed up there are dangers lurking in that I find food (or rather the wrong sort of food) to be a source of comfort.  I know full well that this is not the answer but every now and again I simply have to indulge.  I always feel horribly guilty about it afterwards though! The forthcoming Christmas period will be a big challenge but I’m hoping that I’ll be able to keep things in proportion and not go too excessive on the treats! I don’t like being placed into a category and being classified according to my age, which is what seems to be the case these days. I can see forty-year olds in the street who are far less fit than I am.  But because I’m 67 that makes me an “old” person.  I am not old, and I don’t feel old. Why is it that everybody has to be put into a box of one sort of another?  It drives me nuts. I take responsibility for my own well-being and I don’t see why others don’t as well. My husband describes those who are K7522 continually critical of health services as “the entitlement generation”.  They have always had what they wanted when they wanted it.  Their view appears to be that having paid their taxes they are now entitled to be looked after, even though much of their health issues are due to their own self-neglect. They fail to take responsibility and that is not right. I believe that I have recognised this now, (albeit a little too late perhaps), and it is right that I try to help myself. I certainly don’t expect others to feel sorry for me. I don’t think that either of my parents understood this sort of thing, but they had quite different circumstances under which to operate. For example, my mum and dad were married on Christmas Day, 1940.  There was a war on, and Dad went off to fight in Burma for a couple of years.  Mum experienced the Blitz and then V1’s and V2’s.  It was a scary time and, of course, there was rationing in place as well.  Small wonder then that, during the fifties, when things began to improve, there was little concern about obesity.  Housework was hard and physical, especially wash day and the effort that that involved.  There was a copper and  a mangle and a lot of heavy lifting! Mum considered that feeding the family was one of her key responsibilities and she’d never had any lessons in relation to balanced meals and healthy eating. As things improved you ate more, and you ate more sugary food as that had been in such short supply but was now freely available. It could be viewed as a sign of increased affluence. I can remember when my mum was pregnant in 1961 that we paid frequent visits to the Baby Clinic and the hospital. After my brother was born we made trips to the clinic for baby milk powder, in a big tin and rose hip syrup (which must have been absolutely loaded with sugar!). I can also remember as a four-year-old at school being given vitamin capsules on a daily basis.  There was also free school milk as well, of course, but I never had that because it tasted disgusting (in my opinion). I am not bothered about beauty products at all and I very rarely buy anything like that. I’ve had the occasional massage which is pleasant enough but it’s not something that I do on a regular basis.  I visit the hairdresser once a month and get a cut.  Every two months I get a colour put in as well. My hairdresser, who I have known for many years, is great and we have a lot of fun in choosing colours.  I like to be different and to have a different look although I wouldn’t say that I go too extreme.  But we have a laugh in trying different things – blues, pinks, reds, and greens have all been experimented with.  But I’m not bothered about being grey and during lockdown there has been little option but to go with it. I have three daughters who all spend time and money on make-up and beauty products. When my youngest got married recently (Covid wedding), I was astounded as to how much stuff they carted around with them.  They have subscriptions to beauty product groups and often experiment with different looks.  I’m afraid that I’m in the “Can’t be Arsed” brigade and I don’t know where they have got that passion from.  Certainly not from me. I don’t wear make-up at all if I can avoid it. Spreading dead spiders across my face does not appeal.  I keep a deodorant and I use body lotion to deal with dry skin but other than that I don’t bother. The only thing that I wouldn’t be able to live without is a daily shower and I’m not sure if that counts. It is quite some time since my mum and dad were in the situation of getting ready for work and I’m trying to remember what the routine was, as there was certainly a routine in place.  I can remember my dad shaving at the sink in the kitchen, putting soap across his face, using a shaving brush to K7522 spread it and then a Gillette razor taking off the overnight growth.  He had a small moustache which remained until the end of his life. Mum would get ready in the bathroom and bedroom.  We didn’t have a shower then and so a wash at the sink was the norm. Baths were taken later, usually at the end of the day. Hair was washed once a week, with occasional trips to the hairdresser.  She used make-up but it was restricted to face powder and lipstick. Mum and Dad rarely went out without one child or another in tow. When there was a special event, such as the annual dinner-dance with my Dad’s firm, she would go and get her hair done and additional make-up would be carefully applied. A long, formal dress was the norm and Dad would be in a dinner jacket/bow tie get-up. I used to love seeing them before they set off as they both looked really grand. They would usually return in a cheery mood, often festooned with balloons which they had collected for us to play with. Now, in relation to myself, I have recently had my youngest daughter’s wedding and it was subject to Covid restrictions, but we still did all of the usual stuff.  My make-up and hair were sorted by professionals engaged by my daughter and I made sure that I chose my outfit with care.  I didn’t wear a hat, but my face mask was colour-coordinated with my dress! I used to wear make-up for work but that changed and towards the end of my role I didn’t usually bother. I’m not sure why, other than that I always used to get to work early in order to avoid the traffic and to have a calmer start to my day.  That didn’t involve much time on make-up and hair.  I shower first thing as I get out of bed and I wouldn’t change that routine as I like to feel refreshed in order to start my day. Now that I’m retired I wear casual clothes and jumpers or tops.  When working I would wear what Marks and Spencer would describe as “business wear”.  Suits, skirts, jackets, and trousers (not all at once, of course!). I was smart but not glamorous. So that appears to sum up my health and well-being attitudes and the things which I can remember from the past.  I remain interested in learning of new approaches and philosophies in relation to a healthy lifestyle, but I think that I approach any new ideas with caution, waiting to be persuaded of their relevance to my situation before I practice anything new."

I took early retirement at the age of 50 and haven’t regretted it for a moment. I completed a part-time degree course in Landscape Studies at Sussex University in 2006, obtaining my BA. I live at Southwick in West Sussex, and I am married with two grown up daughters, and three grandchildren, the youngest of whom is 18. I had a heart attack in November 2012, and was fitted with a pacemaker/defibrillator in August 2013. Summer 2020 (No.120) Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Health is being free of illness. Wellbeing is feeling good with one’s lifestyle and overall wellness. A healthy body is one that is physically fit without any disabilities. Fit, young, athletic. Can’t think of anything else. Not a subject I ever think about. Identity I try not to succumb to illness, and am very loathe to take medicines. I am a great believer in the body healing itself with sleep being a big part of this. I generally ignore unwellness and try to work through it. Having said that, I am on medication for my heart, gout and glaucoma as prescribed by my doctor. My attitude to illness was probably influenced by my upbringing when the doctor was only visited (or called in) in extreme cases, otherwise one was expected to ‘get on with it’. Possibly, as a man, giving in to illness could also be seen as a sign of weakness. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing S3035 I don’t ever remember health being the subject of conversation when I was growing up. It was just taken for granted that one was well, until an illness struck, when it was appropriately dealt with. My mother did make me have a spoonful of ‘Radio Malt’ every morning during the winter to ward off colds, which I called ‘Doctor’s Toffee’. We did have a ‘Newnes Family Health Encyclopaedia’ (which I still possess, but never now refer to), where ailments could be looked up and diagnosed. My health education was probably learnt from this source as I was an avid reader when I was young, although I cannot recall any specific examples. We also possessed a full set of ‘The Children’s Encyclopaedia’ which covered many subjects and which I studied at length. These may have contained medical information. Books were the main source of knowledge in those days, there was no internet to refer to. Other than being examined by the nit nurse, I don’t remember health ever being a topic that was covered at school. I did take biology as an ‘O’ level subject and learnt some anatomy and bodily functions from that, although I was already aware of the basics. Key moments When I was about 10 my body started producing large quantities of semen, which overflowed onto my pyjama trousers causing them to become stiff and sticky. I asked my father what was causing this effect, but I think he was embarrassed, and did not give any answer. My parents did give me a sex education book to read shortly afterwards though, without comment. I did not fully understand it at that time due to my age, but as far as I recall, no discussion of the subject took place. Around this time my facial hair started to grow, and so, at the age of 11, at my mother’s instigation, I started to shave, initially with an electric razor. I also grew rapidly taller, so that during my first year at senior school, I was the tallest boy in my class. My upward trajectory stopped when I was about 14, and most of my schoolmates overtook me, so that I then became one of the shorter pupils. I don’t remember my voice breaking, but it must have been around the age of 10/11 when these other changes were taking place. S3035 S3035 I don’t remember having any particular feelings at these changes. As far as I recall, they were just accepted as part of growing up, and were not treated as anything special. Growing older When I was younger I played a lot of sport, which kept me fairly fit, although I did not do any specific training. When I gave this up in my mid thirties I did try jogging for a while with some neighbours, but found the constant jarring was causing me knee problems so I gave it up. I also belonged to a square dance club for many years which gave me good aerobic exercise every week. After my heart attack, I did some gym sessions organised by the hospital to improve my heart health, but I did not persevere with this. I did take up occasional walking and still did so for about 1 hour a week with a small group, but since the Covid outbreak, I have given this up. I do read the medical pages in the newspaper and watch TV programmes on the subject without necessarily heeding the advice given. However the information received is interesting and allows me to increase my knowledge. I keep a daily track of my weight however, and if it should rise unduly, I curtail my eating to reduce it again. As I have got older, I have become more aware of my body, as various bits start to wear out, and I expect this process to continue, however I tend to accept this as part of life and don’t do anything in particular to stop the process. Health, wellbeing and appearance I am often told how well I look, (probably by people who expect me to look old and decrepit having had a heart attack and because of my age) to which I always respond that looks can be deceiving. When I was young, the over 60’s were generally regarded as old, and usually looked it (often aided by the effects of cigarette smoking), but now people don’t S3035 start to look old until they are well into their 80’s and beyond. There are many more 90+ and centenarians about now. I plough my own furrow, and so am not influenced by popular ideals of any sort, and how people look is down to their own lifestyles and choices and has no effect on my own thinking. I don’t think my parents would have been influenced either, as living from day to day was enough for them. However, having said that, I remember a conversation between them (sitting on a bus at Hove Station on return from holiday in Scotland) when my mother asked my father if he would mind if she died her hair. Surprisingly, he agreed, on condition that he was allowed to grow a beard. Both events happened and my father had a beard for the rest of his life. I don’t use any health or beauty products (other than my prescribed medication) unless you include deodorant under this heading. Never having listened to Desert Island Discs, this question regarding my Desert Island item has no meaning to me. Getting ready to leave the house I can’t say that my parents had any rituals when going out that I was aware of, other than to ensure they were clean and appropriately dressed. I don’t have any particular routine when going out, other than to ensure I am appropriately dressed for whatever activity i am doing, and that I don’t smell too bad. I am not that fussy on my appearance as long as I look reasonably neat and tidy. This has always been the case, and I don’t think my attitude has changed over time."

It also has the connotation to me, of how precarious good health can be. This is related to my and my family’s experiences. ‘Wellbeing’ I see as a term meaning a person’s overall ability to enjoy life in a balanced way, feeling content, being able to cope with difficulties and challenges with resilience, whatever one’s state of physical or mental health. I think of the words ‘active, strong, slim, nutrition, positive’ when thinking about a healthy body.  The image that comes to mind is a slim, fresh faced happy-looking young female adult in outdoor clothing. Identity My experience of health and wellbeing has been largely influenced by my parents and having access to good healthcare through school, the Armed Forces and work. Much of my parents’ attitude comes from their own family experience and their understanding of good nutrition, the importance of education and appreciation of life.  I was born in the fifties’ into what was by then a lower middle class (I guess), and I identify as being white, female, from a conventional binary family. Spending my formative years on RAF stations within a stable family meant I had more advantages and access to education, sports facilities and health services than many. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My maternal grandfather was a nurseryman with a smallholding, and he and my grandmother ran a greengrocery and florist business in the Welsh Valleys. My mother used to say that as a young woman she didn’t really appreciate all the fruit and vegetables that were available to her, even during WWII. She recalls being unimpressed by her father’s rhapsodising about a lovely fresh cauliflower! That upbringing obviously made an impression on her though, as she was an excellent home cook and my sister and I were always encouraged to eat a varied diet with a lot of fish, fruit and vegetables.  I don’t remember my grandfather clearly as he died when I was young, but his influence has been strong in our family.  Ironically, he died from pneumonia, having been a heavy smoker all his life.  His obituary mentioned his generous nature during the 1930’s Depression, when he allowed local families to run up credit in his shop, so that they could eat well. I believe he never called in those debts. From an early age therefore, I had an appreciation that home grown ingredients and cooking were important to health. There were rules too; no sweets until after lunch, no pudding until the main course was finished. Interestingly though, my rather Edwardian paternal grandmother expected my sister and I to eat whatever was put in front of us, yet not to clear our plates completely; a lady would always leave something ‘for Miss Manners’. Inoculations, dental treatments etc were a routine part of my life so I knew of their importance too. As children born in the mid-1950’s, my sister and I had a varied diet and were encouraged to be active and have enquiring minds, outside interests and hobbies. I think coming through the War, my parents understood that it was important to work hard and have purpose in life, but also to enjoy it (what I’d now call a sense of wellbeing) and to make the most of every day.  My mother’s mantra was ‘you’ll never be this young again’. I remember conversations about food, choosing ingredients in the shops, and helping to make meals and bake cakes.  I don’t recall any arguments about food -neither my sister nor I were fussy eaters. My mother was adventurous for her time and our meals were not just meat and two veg, but included things like curries, bircher muesli and yoghurt (I remember our friends back in the 60’s were suspicious of this strange dairy food my sister and I enjoyed). When I was around ten I was horrified when I learned that the boy next door would eat nothing but chips and tomato sauce.  I remember he was overweight and thinking how strange he was.  I couldn’t understand it.  I loved trying all sorts of food and I liked helping my father in the garden to grow vegetables. Although we moved quarters every two or three years in the RAF, he still grew annual flowers and crops and I often had a little patch to grow radish or sweetpeas. There was nothing better than digging up potatoes and carrots, and favourite family meals included gammon with broad beans and parsley sauce or lamb and mint sauce – it was my job to cut the herbs from the garden and make the sauces. We were exposed to different foods and cultures and also opportunities to join activities, on the stations where we lived. Learning to swim in the excellent station pools, school athletics and sports days, caravanning, walking and exploring in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy were all part of my early life.  RAF stations are often located in rural areas and returning from Germany we lived in married quarters in a Cotswold village, miles from anywhere and then later on the edge of a village in Glamorgan. Roaming free as a child in local fields and woods, often on my own, climbing trees, cycling along the lanes and fishing for sticklebacks, were all pastimes I enjoyed. I felt alive and happy when sitting in a tree listening to the wind, or when hunting for primroses in the lanes around my house. That connection to nature has always been quite important to me and even more so as I get older. I also loved reading, whether Jack and Jill schoolbooks, Enid Blyton or Arthur Ransome.  Losing myself in a book still helps me relax. This all sounds as though everything was happy and carefree in my childhood, and although it was wonderful in many ways, it wasn’t always the case. I think my first awareness of wellbeing or rather the lack of it, was when I started primary school and became quite anxious.  I felt sick over breakfast. I couldn’t bear the smell of school dinners so took sandwiches but couldn’t eat them either.  I was an average pupil but worked hard and did reasonably well in tests and homework. Moving schools so often (seven primaries, two secondaries) was sometimes difficult.  The advantage was that all the children were in the same boat and although being the new girl could be hard, I was never bullied because of being the outsider. To a certain extent I became inured to change.  My parents didn’t make a fuss, just tried hard to encourage me and adapt each time and I began to understand the benefits of doing things that made me happy. My mother took most of the responsibility for my health on a day-to-day basis. I am of the generation that was fed rosehip syrup for added vitamin C, and Radio Malt (a dietary vitamin and nutrient supplement that in retrospect was probably too sugary to be much good). Morning break with a bottle of milk was part of the school routine up until I was 14 or 15.  The various schools I attended, encouraged physical fitness in different ways; some with team sports, others with more options.  I liked being outdoors and active as a child but wasn’t particularly sporty or competitive. Hockey, lacrosse, relay races, netball were all sports I did at various times, but I preferred individual activities like javelin, trampolining, swimming and ice skating. I’ve always liked music and one of my earliest memories, despite being about my first school where I couldn’t eat through anxiety, was happiness at being allowed to play the triangle. When ill in bed aged around seven, I listened to the radio and heard the song ‘How much is that doggie in the window’ (that dates me!) I recall distinctly telling my mother I felt much better after hearing that. I enjoyed the BBC radio sessions for primary schools called ‘Music and Movement’.  I loved being able to dance and mime to music, and hearing ‘Ride of the Valkyries’ for the first time and thinking how exciting it was and how good I felt, is a strong memory. I’ve always known that good health has to be appreciated as over the years there have been some family health issues. My father had surgery for a detached retina which in the 60’s meant having to keep immobile for a week or more.  My mother who was asthmatic, had some severe bouts that involved hospitalisation.  Those were difficult and worrying times, and I remember being so upset that I refused to have school dinners or sandwiches again and my poor father had to arrange to come home each day from work to give me lunch. Looking back at how my anxiety was related to my digestion as a young child, I am quite relieved that later in life this didn’t become an eating disorder. My parents’ approach to health and any illness has always been not make a big fuss, take clinical advice where necessary and just get on with treatment. We had childhood inoculations, regularly went to the dentist, seeing the ‘nit nurse’ at school was part of the routine.  Some friends seemed to me to be more cossetted and indulged than my sister and I were, when feeling off colour, but I still felt very cared for by my parents. I recall one incident though, when I had flu, and my mother persuaded me to get up and have a wash because I ‘would feel much better for it’.  When I fainted on the landing, she was so apologetic and concerned. When I was 13, I slipped on mud at school and my ankle swelled up.  Everyone assumed it was a sprain and as it was the beginning of half-term I hobbled around for several days before my doctor sent me for an x-ray ‘just to make sure’. It was a greenstick fracture, and I was in plaster for weeks. I remember being a bit aggrieved at this, but quite proud of not complaining too much. I couldn’t walk far with the cast so took the bus to Girl Guides one evening, only to be told off by the captain for being late.  Perhaps it was that generation with experience of war, that didn’t hold with giving much sympathy. My anxiety had become more tangible when I was around nine and cut my finger and felt faint.  I’d had childhood scrapes before, but this seemed different, like getting an electric shock, feeling frightened and sick and hearing buzzing in my head. I remember putting my head against the cool of the bathroom tiles to try and recover.  That surge of adrenaline and my heart jumping into my mouth, became familiar whenever I was in an anxious situation and it developed into a fear of fainting in public. In fact, I fainted at the altar when I was a bridesmaid at my sister’s wedding. The best man gracefully caught me, I was sat in the front pew and given a drink of water but some of the congregation at the back apparently didn’t even notice. The ceremony didn’t pause, I recovered and the rest of the day went without problem or with me feeling embarassed; again perhaps tribute to my parents’ acceptance, non-judgement and practical steps to deal with a situation.  Later in my twenties I developed palpitations from time to time.  My mother had these throughout her life, and I put it down to something similar and worried that I too might eventually have a stroke or heart failure, as she did towards the end of her life. The episodes are horrible, sometimes short-lived of just a few minutes, but on the odd occasion have lasted several hours and have been quite debilitating. They have eased a little as I got older, but despite some investigations it is only in the last three years that I have been diagnosed with an ectopic heartbeat. This isn’t a threat to health and doesn’t need medication but occasionally causes extra beats that are uncomfortable and worrying.  Now I know those heart blips, the palpitations, the feelings I’ve had throughout my life, are not connected with my mother’s heart failure, I feel much calmer and able to cope. If I had had that knowledge at an earlier age, it would have made a big difference to my life, particularly regarding some of my career and holiday decisions. My whole family’s understanding of the importance of a balanced diet and exercise to stay healthy expanded further when my sister was diagnosed aged eleven, with Type 1 diabetes. She showed great maturity and took responsibility for her own care from the start and my parents never had to intervene to inject her.  Other than going into hospital early to be induced as a precaution when having a baby, my sister has never been hospitalised in connection with her diabetes.  She qualified as a physiotherapist and has been engaged in diabetic research studies throughout her working life and into retirement.  She has recently been part of the Jensen Covid-19 vaccination study.  She now uses the latest technology like blood sensors and insulin pumps, but carbohydrate counting has remained important. Her interest and passion for looking after her own health and wellbeing has served her well and that has impacted on me too.  I think I have a pretty healthy diet, and if buying manufactured food, always read nutrition labels, and my choices are largely influenced by them.  Key moments When I was around nine or ten, I was in a public loo with my mother and sister and asked them what the machine on the wall was for. I recall precisely that they smiled at each other and my mother said ‘in case a girl or woman is out for the day and has an accident’. I thought this meant a car accident but was puzzled as I couldn’t see how little bandages from that machine would help!  My mother was open and not prudish and not long afterwards she told me about periods and her own experiences of puberty.  She recalled having her first period (around 1930) and being terrified, telling her mother ‘I think I’m dying’, being given a folded handkerchief and told to go to school.  When she moved to London just before the War, a friend who was using tampons, had to go to a doctor because she couldn’t remove it.  My mother never used tampons herself and thought her friend who did, was very sophisticated. Living in shared digs, my mother was afraid if she had a bath after one of the male residents, she would get pregnant.  All those experiences had made her determined to tell her own daughters the facts of life.  I decided that having periods (we all called it ‘the curse’) was a hugely inconvenient thing and was convinced that I would be a medical miracle and it wouldn’t happen to me. Another layer was added to my underlying anxiety. What if I did start my periods and it happened when I was out, or in school, or in church?  I was so relieved when I started at home and wasn’t a dramatic thing. Even my father was aware of what had happened, and it was no big deal. I benefited from being the second girl in the family and having my sister to discuss things with.  My mother had provided me with sanitary towels, but my sister gave me tampons to try, which was much more convenient, especially when I went away to school.  I went to all-girls secondary schools so you’d think there would be less worry, but even so I remember praying I would never have to undergo the embarrassment of having to go to the matron or the headmistress’s secretary to ask for an ST. That anxiety of being caught out with a period was with me until the menopause, even though thankfully I was very regular.  I remember being so embarrassed on behalf of a friend at school who had to carry out a chair from the dining room when she discovered as she got up to leave, that she had leaked. I was paranoid about something happening to me like that and always took great care having plenty of supplies and planning trips during periods, carefully.  I would double up on protection and as my last job involved working away from the office in sometimes rural areas, I would avoid setting appointments up on the heaviest days of the month. I worked out my itinerary around public loo stops. I am pleased to see more discussion in the media these days about problems that some women get such as pain, heavy periods, and also period poverty. One of the last taboos.  It’s natural, shouldn’t be a ‘curse’. I don’t remember my mother telling me about sex or intercourse but do recall her saying never to be worried about telling her if I ever got pregnant.  I think she gave me a book to read.   My father wasn’t involved.  I don’t recall specific sex lessons at school, other than an explanation of reproduction in biology classes.  Certainly relationship education was unheard of.  As a teenager, I got a lot of information from magazines like Jackie and later Cosmopolitan and I poured over the agony aunt and letters pages for advice regarding everything from the latest lipstick colours to the pill. Despite having a good grounding from my mother, I always looked for peer advice and experience and being away at school, relied on them rather than her or my sister.  I am not particularly happy about my own body shape and think that began around puberty. Prior to that I had enjoyed being a tomboy, slim and tall for my age.  I was a similar size to my sister and many of my clothes were hand me downs, including my first ‘training’ bra which I think was a Berlei lilac gingham bra which my mother introduced me to when I was around 12. By the time I moved to boarding school aged 14, it was obvious I was going to follow the maternal line and become full-breasted.  I was quite self-conscious about this and when I insisted my mother buy me Triumph ‘cross your heart’ bras as I felt secure in those.  Sharing a dormitory with six or seven other girls meant I got used to undressing in front of others, though we were all fairly discreet about how we changed.  I didn’t enjoy communal showers, although that only happened in one of my schools.  I still don’t like them in public swimming pools and usually leave my costume on. Growing older My attitude to maintaining my physical and mental health hasn’t changed greatly over the years but I am finding it harder to maintain as my weight, level of activity and flexibility change with age. I have always been a fairly healthy weight (8-9 stone) for my height (5’6”) although it started to creep up in middle age until I was nearly 10 stone.  Caring for my late husband took a toll and I dropped back to nearer 9.  After he died, the advantage to eating alone was having to think about what only I liked to eat -so having more fish, vegetables and salads.  But lately I have been baking more bread and cake which has been my downfall. I don’t have scales any more so don’t know what I weigh, but the waistbands don’t lie’. This angers me because I know it is my own fault and lack of self-control. I had to stop my three days a week active volunteering after lockdown and have not done much to compensate for that, yet know I have been baking and eating more. I am still interested in nutrition, enjoy cooking from scratch, grow some vegetables, try to keep active and positive.  I know I am not as active as I should be, but I don’t really enjoy organised sport or gym sessions, unlike my sister who belongs to a fitness club and normally does five or six days a week in the gym, swimming, pilates and badminton.  She has continued with a customised exercise regime, even while shielding. I joined a coastal walking group for a while but it clashed with my volunteering so that finished.  I was attending an Age Uk line-dancing class which I particularly enjoyed but that has ceased for the time being. In the past I enjoyed swimming and horse riding regularly but as pastimes rather than for keeping fit. I haven’t done either for many years.  I’d like to start sea bathing again. I found yoga beneficial, but these days I prefer to meditate at home. I took up formal meditation, using a self-help book and CD, when caring for my husband in the last years of his life  That really helped me and therefore him, to become resilient in coping with his illness.  After getting married, I had compromised to a certain degree with our meals as he was a bigger meat eater than me and wasn’t a fan of salads or vegetables.  After his diagnosis in 2008, I did a lot of research into lifestyle changes to help immunity and our diets became better from that point. He even accepted vegetable juices. I’ve always tried to be proactive in my life and look for ways to cope with my anxiety and improve my wellbeing.  After his death in 2017, I knew I needed some outside help. I had some counselling which I found hugely helpful and rather than going through the NHS, I decided to engage a counsellor myself as I wanted specific help on a family matter and could research local therapists with relevant experience. Joining a bereavement music group was a natural choice for me, as I wanted to retain connection with the hospice that had cared for my husband. Music has remained a consolation.  I also became a volunteer for the National Trust and in the hospice’s warehouse and these roles too, became important in my life and sense of well-being. The group and the volunteering helped me hugely to feel more connected, less alone and more positive than I had before.  I am due to start back with the Trust soon so am looking forward to that. I miss the music and friendship of the music sessions hugely since lockdown and although that might resume eventually, sadly the warehouse has been sold. I am hoping to help the hospice in another capacity eventually. I have walked regularly during lockdown and love being in my local woods or walking along the coast, although not very far. Meeting another widowed friend three times a week during lockdown for exercise has been a lifeline as I often feel a bit aimless. My friend and I have a lot in common, always have a laugh together and benefit from meeting up, even if we might initially not feel bothered about going out. Although I am conscious of trying to stay healthy and active and I do things to help my wellbeing, my tendency to over-think, be self-critical and inward looking, I know probably isn’t good. However, I am never down for too long and being aware of what I need to do, and of what is available to help me, I feel is half the battle.  I am lucky to have access to online classes, advice and even counselling workshops through my volunteering, if I want them. I get some health advice through the magazine from Benenden Health of which I am a member, and also from NHS and Gov.uk websites.  When I’ve needed specific advice, I might do a general online search but concentrate my research on valid sites such as the specialist medical charity advice forums.  I rarely read magazines unless online these days, but they have been useful in the past and I still have yellowing cuttings about anxiety, helplines, facial exercises etc. Over the years in my various jobs, I had access to health services such as occupational nurses, lifting and handling courses, opportunities that I took up whenever available. I take advantage of initiatives like the Age UK/University of Plymouth health MOTs.  I have always used pharmacists as helpful sources of information regarding medication. Going back to my active volunteering will help my wellbeing in terms of feeling useful but as I get older, I know it will be harder to stay active and engaged and maintain a healthy weight.  I have a foot joint problem that prevents me walking long distance and will eventually make maintaining my fairly large garden more difficult.  I know from personal experience of family house moves in later life, that it’s important not to leave things too late, so I anticipate moving to a smaller property in the next ten years.  Yet I value the privacy, views, garden etc that I have now and will be less likely to be active and happy if for example, I move to a retirement flat without outside space. I intend to be open minded about joining a fitness class, or a club where I can swim regularly, as my circumstances change. I am in reasonable health overall and take no medication, and I feel it is up to me to stay independent and as fit and healthy as I can, as long as I can. With experience of caring for my mother, father-in-law and husband I am quite apprehensive about the future, not having any children and not wanting to be a burden to my sister and her family.  I want to plan for the future as much as possible, thinking ahead about supported living apartments, sheltered accommodation and the like. I have seen for myself the positives of finding the right residential care, so that is something that I have thought about for myself too when it might become necessary, though the quality or otherwise, of institutional meals, is a bit of a worry. On one occasion when my husband was in hospital, two other men on the ward (one in his forties, the other in his sixties) were both being cared for by their mothers (in their sixties and eighties respectively)  The patients were both being treated for lifestyle problems and I felt quite annoyed about this. I worry almost as much for the health of the younger members of my family, as the older. Health, wellbeing and appearance I can be quite critical of my own appearance and my feeling of wellbeing is closely related to that, as I know on those days when I’m pleased with what I’m wearing, and how I look in the mirror, I feel positive and happy. However, I have often felt unhappy about my proportions.  Having an appreciative husband didn’t offset the fact that I would have loved to have been small breasted, neat and slim.  I’ve always liked the androgynous look in fashion. I look at other women who have poise, elegance, flair, good bone structure, who all seemed to be the ideal I’ve always wanted.  I’ve never wanted to be the conventional ‘feminine’ ideal – pretty, blonde, long haired, full make-up, dresses and high heels, and I can be critical of women who don’t change their look as they age.  Yet some who don’t, seem to be aging much better than me, like Joanna Lumley.  Other women I admire are artistic and talented, striking and different in terms of style yet still so cool – like Annie Lennox. I see my ageing skin and the drooping jawline and remember my mother bemoaning the same fact as she got older.  When looking around at other elderly women with grey hair and glasses she’d say ‘there’s a lot of us around’.  There still are!  She hated the fact that she had to have most of her teeth out in her fifties and always told my sister and me to look after ours.  She had worn spectacles since a child and blamed them for her ‘piggy’ eyes.  To us of course, she was lovely.  But you don’t see that, when it’s yourself that feels that way and I really understand her now. She was very stylish in her youth and photographs show her with high heels, sharp 1940’s suits, gloves and hats. Her 1960’s evening clothes were just as stylish (I wore a couple of her outfits in my twenties). In her later years, she didn’t have much confidence in her own appearance, despite having a good eye and an appreciation of quality clothes. She knew I lacked the same confidence as a teenager, but told me ‘who do you think is looking at you?’  I think she was trying to tell herself the same. I can be equally critical of others as of myself, and often make judgements about the health of others based on what I see, which is a bit unfair when I don’t know the whole story.  And I am aware that someone who looks slim and attractive (to me) might have a very unhealthy lifestyle, or an underlying health problem, that isn’t visible. I do think though, that people’s demeanour, complexion and weight generally reflect their health. When I see other people walking with difficulty, stooping, using a mobility scooter, looking pale and under-nourished or alternatively over-fed, especially the young obese, I can be critical and wonder why they don’t help themselves to be healthier.  They should be wearing better footwear to help their gait, or using a stick to balance better, and if they only ate better, they’d lose weight and not put themselves at risk of type 2 diabetes etc. And why on earth is that overweight girl wearing those tight leggings? Can she see herself? I wonder what they think of me. I think I am more aware of my physical health than I’ve ever been and that’s partly to do with getting older but also now I’m living on my own, feeling worried whenever I feel off-colour.  I feel more vulnerable to illness and am less adventurous (have had a bike for four years but haven’t gone out on it as I’m worried about having a fall during lockdown).  Although I know I feel better when the anxiety is under control and when I am happy about my appearance, I sometimes find it hard to make the effort to improve those. I have become a bit less attentive to my appearance since lockdown, even when I go out for walks or to collect groceries, although not so much that I don’t change out of the obligatory comfortable at home joggers! I’ve only put mascara on a handful of times in the last year. I decided to grow out my short pixie haircut during lockdown and try a short bob as it would last longer in between cuts, but it has been nearly five months since the last trim and my hair is collar-length and makes me feel old and ungroomed. I see other women with long hair tied in a loose, elegant knot that looks so attractive, but on me, looks messy and too young for my face. I have trimmed my fringe myself and tried hard to make it look good, but often I think ‘who cares anyway’ whatever my hair looks like. I’m still committed to spending money on a decent hairdresser every six weeks or so though (after lockdown) and am looking forward to my first haircut in months, on 17th April. My attitude to my looks has changed since my husband’s death.  He was always supportive whenever I felt unhappy about my image, but I tended to make an effort for him anyway.  After he died, I tried not to look like I was neglecting myself and it gave me something to do, to choose and buy new clothes carefully,  put on make-up etc. Now I don’t really mind if my hair flies all over the place, or my spare tyre shows through my jumper. I haven’t neglected personal hygiene though and the one thing I really do care about, is ensuring I don’t have facial hair as it’s something I associate with old ladies who don’t care for themselves.  I’m lucky in that I don’t have much facial hair and what there is, is fair, but I’ve certainly seen an increase in individual chin hairs!  I know that taking care of oneself contributes to one’s sense of wellbeing so I deliberately do things to relax and have taken to having the occasional bath with fragrant salts (I usually shower).

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Both words have positive connotations to me: that’s to say, they imply more than the mere absence of disease. I’d define ‘health’ as the state of being free from physical or mental disease or serious temporary malfunction, and sufficiently energetic to cope with the demands of work, family and leisure. I suppose what I’m aiming at is something like ‘vitality’. Which is why, to me, it makes perfect sense to describe my friend R as ‘healthy’, even though he’s been a wheelchair user all his life: he’s a sportsman, coaches wheelchair tennis and basketball, is fit and powerfully strong and always full of beans. But I might hesitate to describe someone suffering with severe depression as healthy, or at best I might say, ‘X is physically healthy but clinically depressed’. ‘Wellbeing’ isn’t a term I use much but I see and hear it being used in the context of healthy eating, lifestyle choices, personal development and so on. I haven’t much time for that sort of thing, frankly, but it’s clearly big business: I even see magazines devoted to things like ‘mindfulness’ on the newsagent’s shelves nowadays. I tend to think of ‘wellbeing’ as akin to happiness -that’s to say, as a beneficial by-product of human activities -rather than as something one might aim for directly. To me it carries connotations of physical and mental health, certainly, but also a strong sense of personal equilibrium, based on acceptance of oneself and a broad optimism about oneself and the wider world. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term.Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. That old Latin tag mens sana in corpore sano springs to mind; they used to hammer that one into us at school. But the predominant thought is of a girl -I can’t even remember her name now -who lived on the same Hall of Residence corridor as my college girlfriend. She wasn’t tremendously pretty or anything but she was happy and outgoing and always active and busy, and simply radiated a sort of glowing vitality -so much so that I once joked that if we turned out the lights she’d have a shiny aura around her, like the kids in the Ready Brek commercial. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I left this question till last as until now I’d never given a second’s thought to how such factors might affect my health and wellbeing. Obviously I was conscious of how fortunate I’ve been to have been born and brought up in a major developed country with a proper health service, and I was aware that people living in some towns and cities have markedly shorter life expectancies than people living in more affluent places, but that was about it. On the question of ethnicity, I think it might have had more influence on my sense of wellbeing than on my health. Like most white people I can go years at a time without realising or articulating to myself that I belong to the majority ethnic group in this country and that mine is the group that wields most economic and political power. But at some level that must feed in to the mixture of Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon assumptions and emotions that make up my feelings of acceptance, ease with myself and so on. It’s not as in your face as Boris Johnson’s Old Etonian assumption of superiority, far from it, but it’s definitely there in the mix. Social class is more complex. Sure, a child from a relatively small, solidly middle class family will on the face of it have a better chance of growing up healthy and with self-confidence and self-esteem than a child from a larger, poorer, less well-housed working class family, but it’s the middle classes, overwhelmingly, who created, follow and maintain the whole ‘health and wellbeing’ culture, which suggests that they’re not very satisfied with how they’ve turned out. If ‘dissatisfaction, driving self-improvement’ is the hallmark of the middle class then it’s possible that a (self)-conscious focus on health and wellbeing, and a deliberate and sustained attempt to maintain and improve both of those things, might over time bear fruit. But a working class person who naturally enjoyed good health and was unselfconsciously happy with his or her lot might enjoy equal or even higher levels of ‘wellbeing’. I don’t think my gender and sexual orientation would have adversely affected my health and wellbeing -possibly the opposite, in fact. I think I’d have been very happy as a gay person. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I suppose that as a child and teenager I distinguished between being healthy and being ill. I’m old enough to have had all the childhood illnesses -measles, mumps, even whooping cough -that today’s kids are vaccinated against, so even when I was very little I had some concept of ‘health’ as a desirable state to be in. I’m not sure I formulated any such concept of ‘wellbeing’, though; it just wasn’t a word much in use, and indeed, I don’t think I heard ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ being used in their contemporary senses until some time in the very early Nineties. Even then, I suspected that the roots of those usages lay in the vogues for vaguely ‘Eastern’ philosophies and dietary systems that were popular in the counterculture of the late Sixties and Seventies: yoga, macrobiotic food, that sort of thing. Possibly that was because the people talking about health and wellbeing were quite often the same people who’d been treading the New Age path for some time. I noticed, however, that there was a significant overlap between the Eastern philosophy stuff, the gym culture that had grown up in the Eighties and what I might call the alternative medicine culture, with each individual person taking what he or she needed from the menu that was made available: distance runners learning and adapting yoga breathing techniques, for example, people with allergies adopting vegan diets. (I saw both of these things). I was benignly indifferent to most of it but soon came to hate the ‘New Age meditation music’ CDs that got played in wholefood stores and one or two of the bookshops I frequented. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Primarily my parents, and I suppose teachers, when I was in school. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? No, not in any positive sense. There might have been admonishments about things to do, or not to do, in order not to become ill or suffer injury, but the accent would always have been on preventing Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon or avoiding illness or accident, not on achieving health and then building up strength and vitality through study and exercise and diet and so on. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? There were posters up in the common rooms and halls warning of the dangers of smoking, but that was it. Even PE wasn’t primarily intended to educate us about healthy living: it was there to let the energetic and sporty burn off some of their energy, and to get the laggards and bookworms out for some fresh air, but there was absolutely no ‘theory’ to it, along the lines of the sports science courses on offer nowadays. Even if there had been, Miss D, who took the girls for PE, would have undercut its message, given as she was to showing up for work hungover behind wraparound shades and lighting her tenth cigarette of the morning with trembling fingers. Looking back, we must all have taken for granted that we were healthy, at least in the ‘in rude good health’ sense. I left school in the mid-Seventies, so I and my contemporaries had been through the educational selection processes of the time, which quietly and efficiently weeded out and removed anyone who for whatever reason deviated from the rude good health norm. It started in the infant and junior schools, with ‘backward’ boys and girls being withdrawn and sent to special schools, and no child with a physical disability would have been allowed to start ‘normal’ school in the first place. I know that things are very different today and there’s much more integration of children with physical disabilities and mental health problems, which must make the majority more conscious of their status and perhaps likelier to think about how they might maintain and even improve their health and wellbeing. I don’t think there were any magazines or ‘style guides’ aimed at teenage boys and young men in those days -nothing on the lines of Men’s Health, certainly. Even if there had been I doubt I’d have bothered looking at them. It would all have looked too much like hard work. I read New Musical Express and all in all it wasn’t the place to go for health advice. Girls and women in general had any number of magazines aimed at them of course but from what I remember they were more focused on looking good, through attention to skincare and grooming and judicious dieting -albeit to lose weight rather than to maintain health. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I honestly can’t say. I was one of those people for whom it was all a very gradual process, so gradual in fact that its progress was barely perceptible. I was certainly well aware of them by the time I was thirteen or fourteen, because around then I started masturbating, but in terms of physical changes and development, based on the oh-so-casual checking up in the changing rooms and showers at school I’d say I was a little behind the curve, so to speak, compared to my contemporaries. Not seriously so, and I never worried about it, but I didn’t feel that I’d completely caught up till I was sixteen, which is when I started shaving. On balance I think this was a good thing, as there were no sharp or sudden changes that might have upset me, and also it meant that I never had any problem with acne. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon As I say, I started shaving when I was sixteen, at Christmas 1974. Not from personal choice: my mother gave me my (by then late) father’s old safety razor and told me to get on with it. I recall too that only a few weeks earlier a bunch of us boys had been singled out by the Deputy Headmaster and told to start shaving, so maybe there’d been some follow-up letters sent to parents. It seemed rather silly to me, as there was no risk of me suddenly looking like Frank Zappa or anything, and my overriding emotion was one of mild embarrassment. I had the Christmas holiday to get used to it and when I went back to school no one remarked on it so all in all it wasn’t the red letter day it might be for some men. For the purposes of the Directive I’ve asked about among male friends and to a man they, like me, had to be told to start shaving: not one of us ever looked forward to it or was keen to do it even before we needed to. In most cases the instruction to start shaving came in the form of a Christmas or birthday gift of an electric razor. I haven’t done a similar survey among women I know but when I was first going out with girls they’s often tell me about their experiences of starting to have periods and so on. I do recall several of them telling me that when they reported to their mothers that their periods had begun the mothers immediately presented them not only with sanitary products but also with razors, with which to shave their legs and armpits, and finished off by delivering a warning about not getting themselves pregnant. Killing three birds with one stone I suppose. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? If I try to find a common denominator I come up with ‘moderation’ -although that means moderation by my standards, and puts me in mind of that chap mentioned in Keith Richards’ autobiography, who’s described as ‘a degenerate, even by my standards’. Looked at from the outside I might be thought to have given my poor old body a fair hammering. I smoked, admittedly with spells of abstinence, between the ages of eighteen and forty-seven, and I was the kind of smoker who keeps the pack and lighter on the bedside table in case the craving strikes during the night, and lights up the second the alarm goes off. I wasn’t a heavy abuser of serious drugs but I was the sort who’d roll a joint as soon as I got in from work, and I’ve put my time in on all the available hallucinogens, various prescription pills, and opiates up to and including morphine. I’ve hardly had a day without alcohol in my adult life. Also, when I was single, I’d quite easily just forget to eat if there were more interesting things going on in my life. I should look like John Hurt. But I don’t. Regarding the booze’n’fags’n’drugs intake, I can say that I’ve never even come close to letting them take over my life: I’ve never been an alcoholic or a junkie. I quit smoking finally fifteen years ago, and when I did smoke I smoked good quality cigarettes, not those rank cheap things made from factory floor sweepings. On average I probably drink the equivalent of a bottle of red wine a day, which would get my doctor pursing his lips but, when you think about it, hardly puts me in the Oliver Reed class. And without being too conscious of what I was doing I’ve usually eaten a very good diet. I started baking my own bread while I was still at university, and found my way to a version of the ‘Mediterranean diet’ a decade or two before it started getting promoted as the way to a long and healthy life. In my case it was more that I liked the basic Mediterranean diet foodstuffs very much and also liked the fact that they didn’t require too much preparation and cooking. Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon Nowadays I can go weeks at a time without eating red meat -in fact I don’t think I’ve eaten any so far this year. My staples are fish, tomatoes and olives. Above all, I walked everywhere. For most of the quarter century I lived in London I walked everywhere if I could; I regularly walked the three and a half miles into the office every weekday morning, and the same back in the evening, and at the weekends I’d spend half a day at a time describing huge loops around Hampstead, Highgate and Regents Park. And I walked, and still do walk, very fast. Whenever I feel lacklustre I go for a walk, even if it’s just a quick excursion taking in the local bridle paths. I’ve had spells in the past when I’ve taken up running or swimming for a few months, but apart from a bit of muscular toning they haven’t left me feeling any better than walking alone would do. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? I don’t actively seek out information but sometimes I’ll read the ‘healthy living’ supplements in the papers; in fact, only a fortnight or so ago the Times ran a ‘How to stay fit and healthy during lockdown’ series over three consecutive days, and I deigned to look at the diet information. Not too many surprises: basically promoting the Mediterranean diet, with a few additions of the quinoa and raw seeds variety. I have little truck with ‘wonder foods’ and dietary supplements like vitamin pills and extracts and the like. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? Hmm…I think I’m as aware of it as I ever was. Not in a concerned or obsessive way, but just aware. I can’t understand how people couldn’t be aware of their bodies. If something’s changed it might just be that at my age I’m more concerned to keep my body ticking over nicely than to devise yet another extreme way of having fun with it. We all change over time, to greater or lesser degrees, and there can’t be many people who get to my age without having to face up to some changes they don’t much care for. In my own case, and taking into account the years since I reached sixty, that’s been a diagnosis of slightly elevated blood pressure (one tablet, daily) and the loss of a crown, necessitating weeks of treatment to repair: nothing much to worry about. My waist’s a bit thicker than I’d like, but that will settle down once the pandemic’s over and I can get out and about and be more active. The thing I notice most is that I can’t kneel down and get up again with anything of the facility I had even into my fifties: that lightning fast ‘bunny dip’ is beyond me now, and I catch myself slowly, if not actually creakily, lowering myself down to pick up the cat’s feeding bowl or whatever, and think, you probably look old when you do that. I’d probably benefit from taking up yoga again; I did it a lot when I was a teenager and could get myself into all sorts of postures. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I think I’ll carry on much as I do now, unless or until something happens that forces me to take a significantly different approach, possibly under medical direction or supervision. I very much hope not to become seriously ill, or have a stroke or suffer a disabling accident, but the possibility can’t be ruled out. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon (I just remembered another Keith Richards remark: ‘You can be as sick as a dog, but as long you’ve got a suntan everyone assumes you’re in great shape’). There’s a fairly close correlation between the two. We’ve all remarked on other people who ‘look run down’, and have probably had other people saying the same thing about us. Bad diet, drinking too much, mental stress, any number of debilitating diseases and conditions can leave us looking pasty, with bad skin and straw-like hair, you name it. More serious conditions can leave us not just feeling but looking very rough. Take anorexia, for example. It can work the other way around of course: If you’re feeling fit and healthy and full of bounce it’ll tend to show in your smile and body language. I think too that ‘wellbeing’, in the sense I described it above, can sometimes cancel out or even overcome serious health issues. Only a short while ago I learned that a girlfriend of mine, from my mid-twenties, had died; in fact, she died exactly a year ago today, of liver and colon cancer, aged sixty. Shortly before she died she’d been for want of a better term the guinea pig for a new way of administering chemotherapy, and on looking it up on the internet I found a short BBC news clip of her being interviewed and actually having the treatment administered in her hospital bed. And there she was, looking just lovely I thought, and still with a zest for life even as her illness was moving into its final stage. She somehow transcended the situation she found herself in. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Not very much. I can understand why so many women get exasperated by the fashion model ideal, which comes nowhere close to reflecting the way the average woman looks. As for the mesomorphic hunks they have on the cover of Men’s Health, they look little or nothing like me to start with, and there’s no way in hell you’d ever get me putting in the amount of gym and grooming salon time it must take to achieve their appearance. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? I think they were less influenced by ideals of bodily beauty than they were influenced by high standards of appearance, in terms of grooming, clothing and deportment: granted, they wouldn’t have wanted the body inside the smart clothing to be decrepit or seriously ugly, but in itself it was only one component of the ideal, and not the most visible. I imagine that their ideals, as seen in contemporary media, would have been film stars and society figures, rather than sportsmen or popular singers. They’re both long dead and it never occurred to me to ask them who if anyone they idolised in their youth. I should explain that neither of my parents (born in 1904 and 1918 respectively) would have been exposed to much ‘body beautiful’ propaganda in their youth and early middle age, for the simple reason that it didn’t exist in those days, outside of the rather dubious ‘physical culture’ world of bodybuilding and nudism. The various dietary fads of the interwar years wouldn’t have touched them -they’d have been glad to have as much food as they could get. Ditto for the postwar austerity. Like me they were both tall and slim so if anything they might have been keener to acquire or keep a curve or two than to want to lose any weight. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Not really. I do have preferences, which vary from time to time, but I wouldn’t be unable to function without them and I could get used to alternatives. For the record, my products are: Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon Shaving: Gillette Fusion razor, Proglide blades, a bristle/badger mix brush, Wilkinson Sword solid shaving soap (in a bowl) or L’Occitane shaving cream (in a tube), Nivea For Men moisturiser; sometimes I use Nivea shaving foam and sometimes again I’ll use a Braun electric razor, depending on my mood. Sometimes I’ll use L’Occitane after-shave balm. Washing: Pears soap (I buy the blue one but really any of the range will do), Dove body wash or something by Molton Brown if we have it in; Ramer sponge; big cotton face flannel. Teeth: Sensodyne Everyday Care soft toothbrush, Arm & Hammer toothpaste, any mouthwash that’s on offer when I do the shopping; on dentist’s orders I’m currently using TePe and Dentek interdental brushes. You’ll notice I haven’t mentioned shampoo. That’s because I don’t normally use it. If my hair’s become really filthy because I’ve been doing a dirty job in the house or garden I’ll pinch some of my wife’s shampoo, whatever that might happen to be. I don’t own a comb or hairbrush either; I just towel my hair dry and kind of shove it into some sort of order…you’re probably thinking I’m Boris Johnson. I’m not, honestly. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? My father would have been on his way to work before my brother and I got up in the mornings, but he was out and about almost every evening of the week and took great pains over getting his appearance just so. First he took a bath; then he shaved, for the second time in the day. In the mornings he used a straight razor, which I was very scared of when I was little; in the evening he used a safety razor, to top up the morning’s shave I suppose. (I’ve never shaved twice in one day in my entire life, I might add). Then there was the application of hair tonic and the grand ritual of achieving the perfect parting. Finally he disappeared into the bedroom to dress: a fresh shirt, a different suit to the one worn for work, a different tie. I imagine the morning ritual wasn’t much different but he’d have had to run through it rather more quickly. My mother was far more businesslike and as she normally wore very little make-up she was content to see to it that her hair was well brushed and her clothes appropriate to wherever she was going. For any really major event she would make an appointment at the hairdresser’s on the afternoon of the big day and spend correspondingly longer over bathing and dressing, but such days were rare. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Quite a simple one really: straight into the shower or bath, then out and dry off, then shave, then dress. In my working days I’d usually be wearing a suit and tie for work; nowadays it’s jeans or chinos and a casual shirt; either way I don’t waste much time on dressing. As for socialising: when I was in my teens and early to mid-twenties I’d spend a lot of time on getting ready to go to a party or for an evening out on the town. Very possibly I might have gone out shopping in the morning for something new to wear, too. If it was just popping along to the local pub for a couple of pints with a flatmate I wouldn’t make any effort at all, and would just pull on my coat and go. I remember that when wine bars became fashionable round about 1982 I’d make Male, 62, retired civil servant, married, living in East Boldon a little more effort before I went to one: there wasn’t a strict dress code but you were expected to be presentable, which for me meant putting on a clean shirt and wearing a sports jacket rather than my habitual scruffy black leather. From my late twenties onwards I got into the habit of showering or bathing as soon as I got in from work and changing into clean casual clothes, so I was more or less fit and ready to go out straight away."

We sat ( social distancing) on the seating outside, pondering how life would be in the coming weeks. I rarely eat burgers, or visit takeaways, but we savoured every bite of the burger and sip of our milkshakes. Today 21st June we walked the same route having been told that the takeaway part would be opened ( the drive in was open a few weeks ago ) only to be disappointed that it was not the case at the moment. I did however have a cup of hot chocolate from a burger van which was in the nearby shopping area, which tasted exceptionally good. I had a reasonably stocked fridge and freezer and a few packets of longlife milk which I usually store in my shed during the winter. I was not worried about my supply of food. As the week was ending and being considered vulnerable because of my age, I became concerned, especially when the news bulletins were showing panic buying I wondered how I would manage. It was awful watching people squabbling over pasta, eggs and toilet rolls. Tired and stressed NHS staff were on social media asking people to calm down so that there was food available for them to buy for their families. I soon became aware that I had to go shopping as there was no-one else. Two weeks after lockdown I visited my local Spar which is a 10 minute walk to buy fruit , bread and milk There were no eggs or flour. I thought about using a company called Wiltshire Farm foods which delivers meals. I had arranged for a couple of my customers in the library who couldn’t cope on their own to use the firm and they were always pleased with the food. I decided against the idea as I have a good appetite and quite enjoy preparing my own food. I have never arranged an online delivery with the major supermarkets. I hate big supermarkets so previously used Aldi, my local Coop and every few months or so Marks and Spenser. The supermarkets have been really good in responding to the situation allowing NHS workers and older people to have dedicated time slots. I restocked my freezer by shopping in a bigger Coop about 2 miles away from my village and visit every 3 weeks supplementing from the Spar and smaller village Coop, continuing with my veg and fruit delivery. Non essential shops opened this week 22nd June in Wales , so along with a friend, wearing facemasks, we travelled on our local bus service to Talbot Green. I needed to buy replacement brushes for my electric tooth brush and had been searching online for any product that could help with removing plaque from my teeth and came across a sonic brush available in Boots. Catching the bus was fine, there was only one person on the bus. I bought a new pair o trainers from a Sports shop-plenty of room to shop and well marked out. Like wise in Boots and it was lovely to buy some food from M and S, including some underwear. My friend and I kept on our facemasks, which were by now irritating me, steaming up my glasses I don’t how NHS staff can work 12 hour shifts wearing all that PPE. Yesterday 29th June , I phoned the fruit and veg delivery company to request an order only to be told that as the local schools were retuning that they were to supplying them I thanked them for their service and they were grateful that and others were pleased with their products.I think more people One of the worries was the supply of labour to pick fruit and vegetables. There has always been EU nationals, especially Polish and Romanians coming to the Uk as seasonal workers. Travel restrictions and the Brexit vote made them feel unwanted so a campaign was launched called Pick for Britain. It was a way of getting furloughed workers to do the jobs. Thousands of people initially signed up for the scheme, but the actual numbers doing the hard work is very low. The reluctance of workers moving away and living in caravans is not appealing to the majority. What does this mean for our food supply come the end of the year when UK leaves the EU-that could be a problem We import a high percentage of food which was one of the reasons I never supported Brexit. It could prove a disaster for the security of food supply and the continuing pandemic. We wait to find out. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Entertainment and Leisure At the start of lockdown, my friends and I established a two person walking regime, I also spent several weeks sorting out my garden. I decided that I was going to keep myself occupied by gardening. The grass is usually cut by a gardener and I cut the shrubs and trees. The first weeks of lock down was spent digging out Montbretia corms which were multiplying, cutting the conifers and generally tidying the garden. Several weeks on I have had some work done in the garden. I needed remedial work on the pine end of my house after storm Denis and asked the builder if he would be able to remove a small part of the lawn which is always quite damp. He was pleased to have some extra work. I spent days digging out a large pampas plant whilst waiting for for the work. With some chippings and edging stones it really has transformed my garden. Before Cornonvirus,I spent a large part of my week in the library, either worker or joining in the activities, I always cut my grass but because of the amount of time I’m out and about Ive had the grass cut by M for the last 2 years. He decided to reduce the amount of time doing other peoples gardens so I now do my own. I cut the lawns at least once a week and weed trying to suppress the Montbretia from growing. It is a constant battle. I didn’t have much seating in the garden as I don’t usually spend hours sitting outside, especially if it’s hot, I bought a new bench from the local garden centre so that friends ( when allowed) can sit outside. IMG_20200624_135222[1167]As you can see from the photo I arranged the seating and 5 friends came for a coffee on afternoon as a couple of them were feeling very depressed. We had a lovely afternoon chatting and felt a lot happier. The amount of walking I do has certainly increased. Two or sometimes 3 friends walk at least 4/5 and once or twice 7 miles most days We have a walking rota. I don’t walk on a Tuesday and Friday to catch up on gardening, shopping and housework. My weight has dropped with a combination of increased exercise and healthy eating, and now weigh the same as 10 years ago. Although the weather was great in Spring, I didn’t think it safe to visit my Dad, even though I could have sat outside. He is coping well with shopping organised by my niece . I have visited him a couple of times, sitting outside, but the weather has not been so good and am waiting for warmer weather to return. I attended an older person’s Tai Chi class every Tuesday morning in our library. As it’s closed our instructor AW had permission from Age Cymru who organised AW and MM training to send us a video of the Tai Chi lesson. If the weather is too wet (I do walk in the rain ) I will use the video on my laptop. It is very calming. I might do it later as my local pharmacy has messed up my prescription for blood pressure medication ! For the last 8 weeks our dance exercise instructor for over 50s has been organising our class via Zoom. It is a lovely way of keeping in touch and a really fun way of keeping fit. It’s our last class on the 6th July and I will miss the music and the Joy I haven’t played any music at home since my husband died or played CDs in the car, something we always did when on a long journey. I've given them to charity shops and my CD player I do however listen to the radio a great deal, not listening live but certainly on BBC sounds. It will be mostly BBC radio 4 and 4 extra, plays especially. I love history and if there’s nothing on I’ll catch up on downloads of Melville Bragg In our Time series. Early this morning I listened to one on Mary Queen of Scots. I love the Archers and usually tune in on a Sunday afternoon. It’s been odd listening to monologues by different characters as they haven’t been able to record together. The Talking heads new series by Alan Bennett on tv has been excellent. It is a testament to his writing and the quality of acting which has resulted in an excellent series. I have also enjoyed The A word , a BBC series centred around a young boy with autism. The scenery of the Lake district, the humour, the quality of acting, especially from the boy was uplifting. I am watching the rerun of Broadchurch, Fine acting ( Love David Tennent and Olivia Coleman) BBC Channel 4 on Saturday nights always has great programmes, whether its Inspector Montalbano ( I have booked a holiday to Sicily nest year since watching the programme over many years )or Nordic noir. The only soap I watch is Neighbours, which can be predicable. I have hours of history programmes recorded-Bettany Hughes series on Greek Islands, Michael Woods on Alfred the Great and Tutankhamen. A friend and I had booked an overnight stay in London in April with our local Coach Tour company to see Tutankhamen’s treasures at the Saatchi gallery in London, It was cancelled We have a credit note I’m not sure if the exhibition will be kept until next year or it has returned to Egypt An alternative.trip would be to Greenwich to visit the National Maritime Museum and Queen’s House next year. If the situation continues into autumn /winter I might buy some paint and paint part of my hallway which suffered from a little water damage from storm Denis. I have painted part of a kitchen wall which had a few marks from grease and in the garden I have painted my shed and a couple of fence panels I have finished reading Shackleton’s book on the expedition to the Antartic. He is my hero. The way he kept up the spirit of his crew all to survive was remarkable. I am now reading a World Book night book Rising Tide a Swedish crime thriller which I have had on my book shelf from 2015. I usually listen to audio books via the library online resources, but because the libraries are closed , the audio books have been “borrowed” I have been using You tube to access the radio versions of Poirot and Miss Marlpe, Paul Temple, Oscar Wilde plays an Ideal Husband and The Importance of being Ernest, Sherlock Holmes, especially Clive Merrison and Michael William version I have had sleep problems for years I don’t let it bother me-hence listening to the radio and You tube through out the night It’s a shame I can’t retain all the information that I listen to but perhaps I know more that I realise. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Personal Hygeine It’s a wet day today, mid day and I’m still in my pyjamas. Usually on a Wednesday a friend and I go for a walk. She will not walk in the rain, but I would, so I thought I would spend some time completing the summer directive. I have hovered and washed the kitchen floor and don’t intend doing any more housework.I was busy yesterday, cleaning my Dad’s kitchen. It’s a nuisance wearing a mask as the weather wasn’t good enough for him to sit outside, Don’t kow how people can work a long day wearing PPE. They have my admiration. I’ll have egg and cress sandwiches for lunch and then cook a roast chicken dinner later this evening, I’ve brushed my teeth twice and cleansed my face with cleanser and toner. Shower after lunch. Prior to the outbreak, I would shower including washing my hair every morning after breakfast as I was often out and about. If the weather was hot I showered before bedtime ( only have a shower as I had the bath removed 4 years ago so it’s so easy to use the walk-in shower ) As my routine has changed and walking more especially as they are morning walks I’ll shower later in the day or before bedtime. I must confess I haven’t showered every day, depending on how hot it has been and how far and how strenuous the walk. If I have skipped it would only be one day my hair especially would require washing, If I have been busy in the garden I would sometimes shower twice a day There is something relaxing about having a warm shower wearing freshly laundered pyjamas going to bed with the clean sheets. I’ve been cutting my hair every couple of weeks. Lots of my friends are looking forward to nest week 13th July when hairdressers are open in Wales. Most of the walking group have managed to get appointments for the first week. When my husband was alive, I visited the hairdressers every 8 weeks, having it coloured using foils. Looking after him meant I didn’t have time to spend so I let the colour grow out as as it’s not grey quite a natural colour I stopped going to the hairdressers, attending the local college of Further Education and using the students. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.One of my friends thinks I am a cheap skate, but as I always give them a good tip, there is not a lot of difference in the cost. I don’t know how the colleges will be able to offer Beauty and Hair courses in the autumn. It’s a trying time for all students. I also go for a pedicure from time to time and that’s what I am missing, more than having my hair cut and blow dried. On my first bus ride to the nearest shopping area two weeks ago, I bough a sonic plague remover from Boots,I looked online about teeth cleaning as I am concerned about my teeth, Every 4 months I was having periodontal cleaning with my NHS dentist to avoid any further deterioration with gum disease. I also bought new brushes for my electric tooth brush, replacing the heads more frequently than usual. I have brought the brush to my kitchen cupboard to remind myself I to use it more than twice a day and keep it charged. Dentists will be a long time getting back to normal. They are only seeing urgent cases here in Wales, routine assessments and care will only be reinstated between January and March next year. Hope I don;t need a filling before then! F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Sleep Ever since the menopause, almost 20 years ago, I have experienced sleep problems. I have never sought medical help, coping reasonably well. I would often sleep in a separate bedroom from my husband when I was working as he would be awake for long periods during the night, reading, He had retired quite early due to health problems so his sleep pattern was awake during the night and sleep until midday. When he needed more care due to terminal bowel cancer which meant he had a stoma, I was constantly having to help him changing his appliances throughout the night. This meant that my sleep pattern became even worse. He died in 2014 and my sleep has not improved,. I listen to to the radio and audio books and catch up programmes on the renamed BBC Sounds. Since the coronvirus , my sleep is no worse or certainly no better I have resigned myself to the fact I need very little sleep. I may have a cat nap if I’m not busy in the afternoon,especially as like today it’s raining. ( I went to bed at 4.00 pm after having a 4 mile walk and slept until 6.30 ) My favourite catchup sleep day is Sunday afternoon, walking in the morning and going to bed to listen on catchup radio to the Archers omnibus. I love listening to plays and found lots on You tube. I need to have sound throughout the night I have tried silence, but that makes me more restless. I have had several odd disturbing dreams, but fortunately forget them quite quickly. The two most recent that I can recall was my husband telling me that my stomach was swollen ( which it is not I am waiting to make an appointment for a slight prolapse so it is probably connected with that. The other one was I was trying to open my eyes on waking up, but I couldn't. They were tightly shut. Since my husband’s death, I have had several holidays abroad, sharing a room with a lady friend. She always reads for 20 minutes or so. As soon as the book is placed to one side she falls asleep. I’ve tried doing the same, but failed to improve my sleep. Although she doesn’t snore, I can hear hear her breathing and to overcome the problem this is when I listen on my tablet to any plays or talking books. I am always pleased to be able to connect to the internet in hotel bedrooms. If this is not possible, I always take DABs which are small devices which you can hear through a earpiece. Easily transportable run an a small battery. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Technology A week or so before lock-down my small tablet had stopped playing video and audio. I searched online for solution but couldn’t find anything so took it for repair but unfortunately it was unrepairable. I was able to search internet, email, use Facebook and Twitter. The secretary of the library where I volunteer suggested I use the laptop and Apple I pad as the library will be closed for so it me time I was so pleased to be able to access BBC sounds and download audio books from the local authority’s library online catalogue. Although I embrace technology, I am a old fashioned when it comes to mobile phones, and I must be the only one of my friends that possess a bog standard pay as you go phone. I am certainly not mean or frugal but I will buy an updated phone when mine breaks or is lost. Last year the Monday club who meet at the library received a grant for producing pod-casts about reminiscing. This was done with the help of the Secretary of the Monday club (AW) and her daughter whose job is marketing and communications. DA recorded a group of Monday club members talking about a range of topics over several weeks, They are very entertaining and we were all pleased with the results although that can be attributed to DA’s editing. AW and DA wondered if we could keep in touch throughout this awful period by continuing the podcasts and am pleased to say that every other Friday we record a session on Zoom which DA edits and places online on the Monday. It’s not the same people each time, for example we have had AW two granddaughters and our over 50s dance instructor speaking how they are managing their classes via Technology RL our instructor works across the age range with A and it was lovely to hear her publicise the classes that are being accessed online. Our speaker organiser OC is staying with her daughter in Spain, travelling just before travel restrictions She is over 80 although in good health, her daughter felt she was at less risk in Spain that UK. It has been lovely connecting with her from her white washed villa, swimming pool and mountain views. Interesting to hear how the coronvirus has been managed there, with much more restrictions on daily life. I am also using Skype to connect with friends and my family in Bath. I have just finished a session on Zoom with friends from the library hosted by AW. She is arranging for Zoom sessions from next Monday morning for any member of the Monday club for a “chat and char” session. The Secretary of the library has been doing an excellent job of maintaining the library’s profile by sharing on our Facebook page really interesting free online courses, events, talks which I repost. This is the most I do on Facebook. I rarely post anything personal, comment on a political stance or get involved in petitions. I have un-followed a couple of Facebook friends because of their Brexit comments I use Twitter for keeping up to date with political references and follow people that I have a connection with My son uses Twiiter frequently and it’s been a great way of keeping up to date with him in his professional capacity and on times personal. I have 75 followers and follow 57.My son follows 9, 602 people and has 8, 746 followers. Amazing! F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau The Government Where do you start when you consider the response to the Conservative Government actions in dealing with the Pandemic. From the 23rd March broadcast by Boris Johnson and the shut-down of a large sector of the UK economy, it was obvious that there was going to be an enormous number of job losses and business failures. Little did we know at the start, that the UK would suffer so many avoidable deaths. As of today 8th June New Zealand has reported no new Covid 19cases for more then 2 weeks. The P The New Zealand PM has lifted almost all of its coronvirus restrictions. Under new rules, social distancing is not required and there no limits on public gatherings, but borders remain closed to foreigners. What has UK done today. Introduced new rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self isolate for 14 days. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train including Uk nationals must give an address where they will self isolate. This decision is typical of the Johnson Government making irrational decisions. This should have been done at the start “To begin at the beginning” The first cases of coronavirus in the Uk were on January 29th when two Chinese nationals fell in in York The first death was on March 5th, when a woman in her 70s was confirmed to have died from the virus. Meanwhile Johnson was advising people to prevent a wider outbreak to wash your hands with soap and water whilst singing Happy birthday twice. A few weeks before he became seriously ill with coronvirus, he was still shaking hands and appeared to have quite a casual attitude to the situation that was developing. It was a shock when it was announced that he had been admitted to intensive care. I felt that because of his attitude he had put himself at risk. He had not convened a COBRA meeting. The public were being told that catching the infection was the same as having Flu and that people over 70 and had underlying health conditions were the most at risk Exercise Cygnus was carried out in October 2016 to evaluate how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronvirus Ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment. Combined with austerity cuts to the NHS, Social Services underfunding, it has had a disastrous effect on people lives, employment and mental health for years to come. The lack of Personal Protection Equipment and testing especially in care homes has resulted in multiple deaths . Older people in hospital were discharged into care homes without being tested, putting carers and clients at great risk. BAME staff in the NHS seem to have greater risk of death which is quite shocking. A typical response by this Government has been to say to foreign NHS that as part of the National effort to combat coronvirus doctors, nurses and paramedics will automatically have their visas extended for one year free of charge David Lammy a Labour London MP tweeted that NHS workers who are risking their live to save British lives should be allowed to stay in the UK permanently I couldn’t agree more The Chancellor has been the one Government minister who has shown some semblance of sound judgement in the way he had dealt with the economic fall out of minions of people furloughed from their jobs. The scheme has been extended until October but I know people who have been made redundant since being furloughed. The economic situation will be dire for a long while. I have more faith in the way that the Welsh Government have dealt with the situation. At the moment we can only to travel no more than 5 miles and to exercise locally. People from England who travel to beauty spots in Wales are sent home, so we do not have crowded beaches as in England. Non essential shops are still closed although there will be a review within the next week At some point, there will be a review of what has happened, but when you read about the number of excess deaths in the Uk since the beginning of the outbreak has passed 63,000 according to the figures from the ONS might It is an appalling statistic These figures might have been caused by factors connected to wider changes for example reluctance by some people to visit a doctor or hospital or having long term health conditions made worse by having to remain at home. I am not not satisfied at all at the way this Government has dealt and continues to deal with crisis. Friends say about hindsight. They knew what was coming. I’ll prepared, making statements and promises that are not kept F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau The News Since Brexit, I have stopped watching BBC news at 6.00 pm as I felt the corporation was becoming a mouthpiece for the Government. I watch the 6.30 BBC Wales news for information on the situation in Wales. My source for latest developments are reading on-line news, BBC news, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Guardian, Independent, Wales on-line, Huffington post. The Guardian and Independent are now headlines only as understandably they are relying on subscriptions for the full article. I watch Channel 4 news either at 7.00pm or plus one at 8.00, but more often than not, record to watch later in the evening. I feel the reporters ask more probing questions and do not show dereference to Government Ministers ( If they choose to appear as more often than not they fail to appear when asked ) Most mornings I go for my daily walk, so I don not watch the Welsh government’s daily briefing at 12.30 and do not watch the UK Government’s briefing, preferring to read the content. I find the whole thing depressing , hearing the daily death figures. The Welsh Government like Scotland has a BSL interpreter and it is quite shocking that the Uk Government do not feel the need relying on the BBC news Channel to provide interpretation. There was an article about the BSL interpreter for Wales saying how she is now recognised when out and about and feels that the Welsh Government has led by example. I am not aware of anyone finding it a problem, although several friends have hearing impairment and have hearing aids. I’m sure it must be very frustrating and example of needs of disadvantaged are not met. I seems such a small request, but it is very petty. Hopefully a petition can rectify the problem. F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Work and Home Life I am retired from my job as the Librarian where I worked for 42years. I am a trustee, volunteer and committee member of the group that run the volunteer managed library. I was still, therefore “working”Until 20th March. Although the situation I the country was becoming gloomier, the library was continuing to operate. We had arranged a speaker for the 16th March to talk about walking to Base Camp Everest, but decided to cancel. Our Secretary emailed the committee to ask our opinions on closing the library. She was already working from home from her job as a project manager for a bank. I suggested we enquire what the local authority’s library policy was and act accordingly. After the PM’s broadcast later that day, I felt that the library should close, but in order for our valued customers to come and borrow as many books as they needed, I asked the committee to consider closing on the Friday evening. That was the agreed. The volunteers were already taking great care and I cleaned the public computers after every use. I phoned as many customers that I could to advise them of our imminent closure. I worked the last session on my own on the Friday evening 5.00-7.00 It was very sad as we usually have a knit and natter group on a Friday evening and there is always a lovely atmosphere The few borrowers that visited the library were very appreciative that they had been informed. I locked the library and felt very sad as it was obvious that reopening would would be many weeks away. The library is a great asset to the village, as there is a group called the Monday club which is although independent is considered an integral part of the library. I am a volunteer with the group ,vice chair and liaison between the library and Monday club committee. The Monday club arranges speakers, arts and crafts, arm chair exercise, Tai Chi.Nordic walking group We have theatre and cinema visits, luncheon clubs for a member’s birthday. There is something for everyone. I thought I would be depressed at missing all our activities, but because I have been able to walk and garden ( as mentioned in the Health section ) I am coping well. I am more anxious about my family in Bath who are shielding. My 97 year old DAD is ok, missing his weekly pint and sing song at the local social club. We keep in touch via Zoom ( more in the next section) and try and keep upbeat. I sat outside in my back garden with one my fellow volunteers yesterday afternoon who I met on my daily walk earlier on the in week. She was very tearful, so invited her for a coffee. She lives with her husband and because she is diabetic, her son does their shopping. She was worried about the arm chair exercise group and Tai Chi people that she tutors in the library. She and the other Tai Chi instructor contact each person at least once a fortnight. I asked if there was anyone particular that I could help. We had a lovely chat , she arrived at 2.30 and left at 4.45, hopefully feeling less depressed. Yesterday morning a friend and I were out for a walk and a chap who we were aware of and who has had mental health issues, was walking his dog and I could hear his voice raised, He was shouting how awful the world was and how he was fed up. We didn’t know what to do. I felt that we should do something but don’t know where he lives. It’s an awful time and will get worse as the economy suffers. B1752 F Widowed Retired Branch Librarian Beddau Part 2 Corvid Health I think I’m coping far better than I thought I would when it was announced on the 16th March by the Prime Minister advising everyone in the UK against non essential travel, as well as advising people not to visit pubs, restaurants .People over the age of 70 ( myself ) and those with certain health conditions should stay at home. Where possible, people should work from home. A group of friends who normally meet at the local library decided that we would continuing our walking but keep the distancing requirements and met on the Sunday to walk our local community path. It was quite busy with families but everyone was adhering to keeping space. We arranged to meet on Tuesday morning. That changed after the Prime Minister’s broadcast on the 23rd March. It was devastating news. People would only be allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons Shopping for basic necessities as infrequently as possible One form of exercise alone or with members of your household Travelling to or from work but only if absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home No meeting of friends. All non essential shops were to close. There was a lot of phoning after the broadcast as we knew we could not meet for the foreseeable future. We were very tearful as we are mostly widowed or divorced and live on our own, I decided that I was going to keep myself occupied by do some gardening. The grass is usually cut by a gardener and I cut the shrubs and trees. The first weeks of lock down was spent digging out Montbretia corms which were multiplying, cutting the conifers and generally tidying the garden. The gardener was unable to come so I cut the grass. The only reason I asked M to start cutting the grass was because I spent so much time in the library and going out and about. We were keeping in touch by phone, but we realised that for the sake of mental well being we would device a walking rota of 2 people. This we have continued to do and has made such a difference. I used to be a volunteer path walker where once a month myself and a friend would walk the local paths which were called Bunny walks on behalf of Llantrisant Community Council. It has been enjoyable taking the girls to areas nearby which they were unaware of. Gardening and walking 5 days a week has meant that I am f"

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to Please start each part of your Directive reply on a new sheet of paper with your MO number, gender identity,  age, marital status, the town or village where you live and your occupation or former occupation. Remember not to identify yourself or other people inadvertently within your reply. It is best to use initials instead of real names. different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. mine, muscles, slim, active, sport Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. The line drawings of naked man and naked woman from school biology text book. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I think my identity has probably had a positive influence on my health. I am not male, so I don’t feel the need to soldier on until I drop dead. I am white, so I am more likely to be the same ethnic group as the healthcare professional I see, which probably helps. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My mum Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? School did a lot of telling us not to smoke and not to take drugs. Can’t recall any actual positive advice. PE was like something out of First World War propaganda: it was all about doing your duty for the school and not letting your team-mates down. Pro patria hockey and all that. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I am very aware of my body. This is from 20 years of martial arts training. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I have already had to stop kung fu. It was full contact and I was getting injured faster than I could heal myself. I expect my endurance fitness to remain good for many years so I should be able to continue to run, swim and cycle. When the covid restrictions end, I’d like to take part in triathlons. I already take some steps to safeguard my mental health. I have an evening put aside for writing every week and I make sure that work does not “bleed over” into family life so that I am always-on. I expect this to be even more important as I age. I have some concerns about mental health during the menopause as this is already a problem for some of my friends. I try to support them now. I hope that by “paying in” in this way they will be able to support me when it’s my turn! As I get older and older I worry about whether I will ever be able to afford to retire. State pension age will be 70 for me. I have been paying into company pension schemes since I was 22, but there is no final salary pension for my generation. After all these years, I’m predicted £5000 a year. I am not yet sure how I will balance needing paid work with an aging body and mind. I am trying to pay down my mortgage and think of some alternative investments while I have a good income. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Health is only loosely related to external appearance. In swimming and running races, I am beaten by people of all ages, shapes and sizes. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I once tried to be thinner. But it made me feel sad, cold and tired all the time. Fuck that for a packet of biscuits. I’m a healthy weight for my height. Everything else is bullshit. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My mum has spent her whole fucking life on a diet. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Olay factor 15 day cream. I could live without it. I’d just be drier. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? My mum’s actual leaving-the-house ritual went like this: running late for school, be unable to find car keys. Yell, “Nobody’s going anywhere until I find my car keys!” at children. Search house in bad temper. Yell, “Well, they won’t be in there!” at children for looking in stupid places like the cutlery drawer. Find keys. Chivvy children into family Morris Marina. Give it too much gas trying to start and flood the carburetor. Wait 5 mins for it to drain slumped over steering wheel in dramatic despair while children exchange worried glances. That’s not what you meant though. All I remember about her beauty routine was that it was the 1980s so she wore blue eyeshadow. The lesson I take from this is that how mad you act makes more of an impression for good or bad than what colour your eyelids are. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I have never routinely worn makeup for work. I have a wash and brush my hair. In the days when I worked in the office instead of from home, I would wear black trousers and a smart top. For an evening out I might wear lip gloss and mascara (never could stand the pore clogging gunk that is foundation)."

Poor health means just the opposite; that your day to day life is dogged by things you either must or mustn't do with your body in order to either make things better or not make things worse.Wellbeing is more of a mental state of contentment, so it's possible to have poor health and yet be happy, mainly I think, due to having accepted your situation rather than spending your days tearing your hair out and saying, 'Why me?'Five words to sum up a healthy body: Energetic, supple, pain-free, unmedicated, robust.Person or image that comes to mind: It would probably be one of the presenters of the walking/exploring type of TV series which I enjoy- coastal walks, walks along old railway routes, etc. Julia Bradbury or Rob Bell. Someone with a backpack who's striding out on a sunny day and who isn't averse to a slice of cake or a pint of beer along the way (it wouldn't be someone who lives at the gym, pumping weights in order to have a six-pack).IdentityI'm a bit stumped as to what to write about this. It's pretty obvious that women and men share a lot of health issues but also have others which are specific to their sex. 'Women's troubles' have often been belittled in the past, even when they are having catastrophic effects on the sufferer's lives.And, only last week, black women were talking on Woman's Hour about how they are treated differently and talked down to during their maternity care. How do I know what my experience would have been if I'd been born male, black, gay or posh? I could tell a few anecdotes here, like the male doctor who suggested having a child as a cure for my excessively heavy periods (what a stupid idea, I thought), but a 'different experience' is just speculation. I think I'll leave the analysis to PhD students or medical statisticians.Growing up and learning about health and wellbeingWhen I was four, in 1960, I had to go into hospital with a bone complaint in my hip joints, and I stayed there for 2 years 9 months, in bed and lying flat on my back, strapped to a metal frame. As I have only a couple of memories of my pre-hospital life, I knew from being very young that there was1J7420: Autumn 2020, Everyday Health & Wellbeingsomething wrong with me. I also knew at that age that my parents were different from other childrens' parents as they were both totally blind.IBefore I went into hospital I was looked after by my parents (mostly my mum), and by her older sister who lived with us. This all changed when I went into hospital and my care was handed over to nurses and doctors. This was particularly hard on my mum; that strangers were now responsible for organising my meals, cleanliness, haircuts, dentistry, etc. In the 1960's, whether it was your parents or professionals giving you health information, it was generally given as a series of orders: 'You will wash your hair or you'll get nits' (not true), or ''You must clean your teeth twice a day or they'll decay and you'll have to have them out.' Or sometimes, 'Just do this because I say so.'In hospital, I wasn't told much about the progress of my hip condition, just that I'd be going home eventually but nobody knew exactly when. Actually, Mum and Dad weren't told that much, just that the softened hip joint would spontaneously harden again, this would be visible on one of my six­ monthly X-rays, and then I could go home.My parents had very different attitudes to health and to medical professionals. Mum was more pragmatic about health matters and more trusting of doctors, usually following their advice to the letter. Dad was suspicious of all medics, often believing that they had a hidden agenda - making life easier for themselves, doing experiments on their patients, etc. So when it came to my hip complaint Mum, though initially extremely upset at being told that if they didn't comply I'd develop arthritis and be unable to walk by the time I was thirty, just got on with arranging hospital visits and making my time there as good as possible. Dad was in an absolute rage with the doctors and seemed to think that they were deliberately splitting families up for their own amusement. He wanted to research my condition himself (practically impossible in the 1960's), ask a ton of questions and query their decisions. And when I did develop arthritis at twenty five, he took great satisfaction in saying I told you so - it was all for nothing. By then I was training for a medical career myself and I talked to him about how treatments change over the years and the treatment you get depends on when you're born (by then my condition wasn't treated by hospitalisation and bed rest any more) but he was still very bitter.Mum did overrule Dad on quite a few health matters, most noticeably regarding dentistry. Dad hated dentists even more than doctors, and only went when he was in pain. He had some of his teeth and a partial denture but Mum had full dentures and didn't want me to end up the same. So, against his wishes, she dragged me to the dentist every six months for some quite horrific non­ anaesthetised drilling and filling. A few years after I left primary school, I bumped into an old classmate and was horrified when she smiled and revealed a mouthful of brown stumps. 'This is what happens,' I thought, 'if you don't go to the dentist. Thank you, Mum.'Mum and Dad were also very wary of me having any vaccinations because Mum had lost her sight as a result of a smallpox vaccination when she was a baby. They'd reluctantly let me have my infant vaccinations, but refused to let me have the BCG at school when I was in my teens. I vividly remember one of the girls at school saying, 'You deserve to get TB,' when I didn't go with the others2J7420: Autumn 2020, Everyday Health & Wellbeingfor the jab (I had it later, in my twenties). Problems arose again when I had to have smallpox and typhoid vaccinations for a school trip to the Middle East in 1972. My parents nearly refused those too but gave in when told that I wouldn't be allowed off the ship at Haifa if I hadn't had them. On the day of the smallpox jab, Dad thrust a rosary on me (we weren't Catholic but hey, any port in a storm) and said they'd both be praying for me. I'd been OK up till then but the rosary and the prayers seriously spooked me. There were no ill effects.Up to the age of eight, when I returned to my original primary school, I'd been treated as an unwell, delicate child. When I left hospital I had to wear callipers and learn to walk again, and I went to a school for handicapped children for a year. So at eight, I wasn't very robust, I tired quickly, and I really wasn't prepared for the rough and tumble (and the noise!) of normal school playgrounds.Some of the kids knew where I'd been and made allowances but some just seemed to like fighting and shoving you about.At primary school I enjoyed swimming but the games in the school hall were a bit of a trial. On Fridays, the 'apparatus' was set up in the hall - an adventure playground-type arrangement of beams, ropes, ladders, hoops, etc - and I tried to do all the easy bits, well away from the most boisterous kids. The teachers were OK with me (I think they'd all been informed by the head that I was delicate), it was the other kids that were the problem.One of the male teachers used to organise occasional weekends away, youth hostelling, and I longed to go, not realising how strenuous it would be. My parents, after informing the teacher concerned, eventually relented, but it turned out to be a mistake. I'd had no idea of the walking distances involved and I quickly tired. It became a miserable trudge until the teacher gave me a piggy-back, telling me that all the others would be jealous. I suppose that I was at my walking best from fifteen to twenty five but after the youth hostelling torment, I shrank away from anything that involved being on my feet for any length of time. It was never suggested and never occurred to me that I could have done anything to strengthen my leg muscles but I probably wouldn't have been interested in that anyway.At secondary school we didn't have any sort of health education as such. There was just PE, 'balanced meals' in Domestic Science (healthy... ha! We were being served up spam fritters and jam roly poly for school dinners), and a bit of sex education slotted into Biology classes.School games... oh God. I hated hockey, netball, tennis and running, trying just to not get noticed. Other stuff I just could not do - long jump, high jump, throwing things, vaulting over things.Badminton and swimming were OK. Once again, my parents had informed the headmistress of my medical past and she was supposed to have a quiet word with the PE teachers about me, but our PE teachers changed all the time, the headmistress very likely forgot, and any explaining was left to me, 'Please miss, I was in hospital with my hips for nearly three years then I had to learn to walk again, so I'm never going to be able to vault over that horse.' Well, I didn't bother. Some of the PE teachers were OK and tailored their lessons to what each girl could do but some were hard as nails and just3yelled that you weren't trying! In the sixth form we were supposed to do one session of PE a week, so me and my friends just did comedy volleyball in the gym together and that was actually great fun.In Biology, there was a bit of 'this is what smoking does to your lungs', but I'm not sure how much use it was. The girls who thought smoking was cool and were smoking already didn't listen, and me and my friends just thought smoking was idiotic, smelly and a waste of money and had no intention of doing it.Sex education was thrust upon us in alarmingly real fashion when, in the fourth form, one of our number became pregnant at fourteen. Sex had been explained to me when I was about twelve, not by my mum (who, though quite forthright at explaining some bodily functions, stopped short at spelling out the mechanics of sex), but by my cousin who was eighteen months older than me. I also looked a few details up in the local library. But one of us actually getting pregnant at fourteen was shocking.Just after we all found out, our headmistress came to speak to us at the start of one of our Biology lessons. To call her speech excruciating was an understatement. She never actually said, 'Sis expecting a baby- the rest of you be bloody careful!' she said something like: girls and boys are very different. At your ages when boys are with girls they can get so carried away that they cannot stop themselves. It is up to you not to lead them on. Revealing clothing such as 'hot pants' will excite boys and lead you into trouble.During her speech we were all fighting laughter and as soon as the door closed after her, suppressed snorts blasted forth. Our young, pretty Biology teacher was smirking too and shouted, 'Right you lot, that's enough of that. Back to transpiration.' Saying 'hot pants' was enough to set everyone in the room off for the rest of our time at school.It must have been a year later, in the fifth form, before we had a Biology class chat about contraception. I remember discussing the Pill in some depth (one or two of the girls seemed to know an awful lot about it) and other methods being briefly mentioned but it was all a bit sketchy. I got more info from magazines. Mum wouldn't have talked to me about contraception because she assumed that I'd be a virgin until my wedding night and that was a long way away. She thought I'd be sensible enough not to do 'anything like that' before I got married.The group of friends I had didn't talk much about sex either. I don't know why we were so cagey - fear of giving away how little we knew? And talking with friends about health matters was more about looking good (which shampoo/cleanser? Was thick make-up worth it if it gave you the spots that it was supposed to be covering up?) than about health.Magazines for young girls, like Jackie, were useless for anything practical. They just told you to eat jelly cubes to strengthen your nails and to run your wrists under the cold tap in the loo if you got too hot at a party. To find out anything adult you had to buy an adult magazine which you were meant to be too young for. Then you found out that there was no need to douche your vagina because it4kept itself clean. Phew, that was a relief because I'd no idea whether a douche was something you could improvise at home or something you had to buy from Boots. I don't remember the article explaining that.Key momentsI suppose I'd be about thirteen when puberty hit - the beginnings of breasts, body hair and periods - the unholy trinity (boy, am I going to have fun writing about this horrendous time in my life). Naked showers after PE kept us all bang up to date with how we compared with everyone else in the class. You weren't meant to stare but you looked as much as you dared. So at thirteen I was aware that some girls had no breasts and some had huge ones that necessitated C-cup bras. Some had pubic hair sprouting, some had none. Some had started their periods (no shower and sometimes, no PE).I was desperate for my first bra but there's little point when you're perfectly flat. As soon as I had the slightest swelling, I was off to Littlewoods to try on a selection of 32 AA's. I soon found out that bras were bloody uncomfortable and for decades I don't think I had one that fitted properly. I've spent my life avoiding bras as much as possible. But it was nice to flash your pretty new bra in the changing rooms back then.Unwanted body hair was a worse problem than bras. The message came at you from all sides; to be feminine is to be smooth and hairless in all 'those' areas. Not the pubic area - pubes were normal in the 1970's, thank God. I'd have hated to have grown up in the age of pubic waxing. No, you just kept it tucked away inside well-elasticated knickers and swimming costumes. But underarm hair, leg hair and facial hair... only women who lived in communes or German women flaunted that sort of hair.I don't remember having top lip problems but I did use a razor (a dainty, feminine type) and shaving cream/gel (flowery smelling feminine stuff) on my legs, arms (I had quite a lot of forearm hair) and armpits. I toyed with depilatory creams but they were smelly, messy and didn't always work well, especially on the armpits. Even shaving didn't work well there and I had to shave just before wearing anything sleeveless in public to avoid that stubbly look (then the deodorant often made you scream with pain). It was easier to avoid sleeveless garments altogether. I couldn't understand how dark­ haired women in magazines or on TV achieved that flawless pit-look with no tiny dark spots of hair just under the skin. They must have had some skill that I didn't have.Periods - the worst nightmare of all. Mum had told me a lot about periods (it was a nuisance but meant that you were a woman at last) and my older cousin J actually started her periods when she was on holiday with us. She had nothing with her so Mum went to the landlady of our B&B to enlist her help. Mum thought it was terrible that J's mother hadn't prepared J enough for the great day, so not long after, we bought a sanitary arrangement for me to carry around with me just in case. It was called a Nikini and was a sort of plastic and elastic mini brief with poppers for the pads to attach to. I'd seen an advert for it, told my mum (who thought it sounded very modern) and we bought it together. This was before stick-on pads had appeared in the shops.5I 'started' at thirteen, in the Ladies of a pub where we were having lunch and whipped the Nikini out of my bag like a pro. I was thrilled to have reached this milestone and like most of the other girls at school, whispered 'I've started' to my pals so that the news would get round. But just like the first bra, the euphoria didn't last long. I had very heavy periods right from the start and if you don't compare detailed notes with other girls, you don't realise that you're much further along the scale of period incapacity than most of your schoolfriends. I just thought that they were all managing their periods far better than I was; that they had some instinctive female knowledge of how to cope and that I alone was botching it up. I had to ask my mum for money to buy so many pads and, for one whole week out of four, my life was a misery of constant loo checks, the embarrassment of pad disposal and the terrible fear of 'accidents'. I remember a boy at my church youth club regaling his mates with a story of seeing a girl getting up from a chair and leaving a bloodstain behind. He told this with suitable retching noises and I knew that if this happened to me, I'd want to die- I wouldn't be able to laugh it off or call him out by asking him why he was such a vile specimen of humanity.One lovely girl at school was such a fan of tampons that she gave sample ones away for us to try out. I longed to be able to use them on their own but they weren't reliable enough and, even using the biggest size, I had to back them up with small pads. There were even more accidents with tampons. On a school trip, I leaked while asleep in bed and the next day, sneaked the bottom sheet into the showers, scrubbed at the blood, then slept on a damp sheet that night. Telling the teacher in charge what had happened and asking for her help was out of the question. Pretending nothing had happened was the only option.The misery went on and on and if there were other girls who had similar problems, I didn't know who they were. Maybe they thought they were alone too.I was constantly anaemic and on iron tablets. There was some reprieve in my twenties when I briefly went on the pill but the monthly torture wasn't really resolved until, in my forties, I was found to have such a low blood count that I was admitted to hospital for tests, then fitted with a Mirena coil. My periods soon stopped altogether and it transformed my life. I wished I'd had a coil fitted twenty years earlier.So, to sum up, adolescence was a mess of discomfort, misery and embarrassment and I was bloody glad when it was over.Growing olderWhat have I done to actively maintain my health? Well, I've never smoked (why would you?), never taken drugs (ditto) and only drunk to excess on a few occasions when I was in my teens and very unhappy. I associate being drunk with being miserable and I don't ever want to be in that state again.Band I have never eaten very much processed food or takeaways. Even in our first bedsit when we just had a Baby Belling to cook with, we tried to make proper meals. It still amazes me that some people seem to live on microwaved meals and frozen pizza when omelettes, soup, pasta and6cauliflower cheese are so nice and so easy to make. Having said that, both of us love dairy products, so our diet is high in cheese, butter and cream. I can imagine giving up meat as we are all being urged to do (and Band I definitely eat less meat than we used to) but I can't imagine cutting back on the dairy because theirin lies all the joy and deliciousness of our meals. We also enjoy sweet things far too much. I know we should cut back on cakes, biscuits and puddings but ...Exercise is a problem because I've always had mobility issues and, since I was forty two, had replacement hip joints. B loves walking and I have tried, but it's often been a case of 'I must do this because it's good for me and I'll seize up if I don't', rather than that I'm longing to get out into the country and enjoy some beautiful scenery. I've done some nightmare walks which have turned out to have blocked or unclear paths or unclimbable stiles and I've become very upset and got home in tears, swearing that I was never going to go on any ****ing walks ever again. Now, I only do walks if they've been checked and if they're flattish with good paths. It makes sense.I've had a few mental health issues over the years: anxiety, panic attacks and 'low mood' (I hesitate to call it depression because it's never been full blown depression as I understand it).The first real problem I remember was shortly after my mum's sister died. My lovely Aunty C lived with us; she was like my grandma and she died very suddenly of a heart attack when I was fifteen. For a while afterwards, whenever Mum and Dad used to go out in the evening, I would be gripped by terror that they wouldn't make it home. I would take up position in the living room window, peeking through the curtains, staring at the spot where they'd become visible as they walked up the street. I'd do this for an hour or more sometimes, then when I saw them coming, I'd pick up a book or put a record on and get ready to act nonchalant when they came in through the door.It was another five years before Mum died, also suddenly of a heart attack, but, not being as fond of my Dad, I didn't obsess about him dying too. The 'suddenly being left alone by the one you love' syndrome transferred to my husband and I have never managed to shake off the fear of him possibly not coming home again whenever he's late back from a walk and I'm waiting and waiting. He's got a relaxed attitude to time passing and he doesn't understand why I can't say to myself, oh it's probably a train delay, and just get on with reading a book or watching TV until he appears. It's impossible to explain to a non-worrier that youcan't concentrate on the words on the page due to the many dreadful scenarios playing out in your head. To me, if I stopped thinking like this, it would mean that I'd stopped loving him - that I no longer cared whether he came home or not.After Dad died, when I was thirty four, I began having panic attacks which were related to being out of the house. Many a trip out was ruined by wanting to just go home ASAP, and going on holiday was difficult. I sought help when I had trouble getting to work on the bus one day, then couldn't function so had to come straight home again. I was prescribed relaxation exercises and they did work, though I've remained affected by anxiety to varying degrees. I got back into relaxation and mindfulness when I was having terrible problems at work. I wish I could say that I've kept up with it but I'm afraid it's something I only turn to when in difficulty. I know logically that I should do it all the time as a preventative measure... but I don't. I wait till things are bad.7J7420: Autumn 2020, Everyday Health & WellbeingI get info about health and wellbeing from the internet these days, occasionally from books, though I'm careful not to use dodgy websites or to spend time reading other people's advice. I think there's more harm than good in 'this is what happened to me' chat threads.Am I more or less aware of my body now? Well, I've always had health issues so it's not as if, after a fit and active life, now that I'm in my sixties I've been pulled up short by the ageing process. I can't say that I'm more aware of my body now, as I've always been aware of its shortcomings. I've been adapting to changes all my life and that's just continuing. If I'd been told in my twenties, that from being forty two (when I had my first hip replacements) I'd be using a walking stick, I'd have been horrified - but the stick was necessary to keep active. I've got a sporty-looking German-designed one, and it's just part of me now. Equally, if I'd been told that by the time I was sixty four, I'd have had ten eye operations and lost patches of my vision, I'd have been even more horrified. But it's all happened (and is still ongoing- more eye surgery is lined up) and I've coped up to now. The fear never goes away but I take comfort in the fact that medical knowledge and expertise is constantly evolving in order to help people like me. The thought of my dad's failed retinal surgery in the 1930's haunts me- I'm lucky compared to him but that doesn't mean that I'm not worried about my future. In the future I can't see my attitudes to health and wellbeing changing much. Even if I had some great health scare am I really the type to eat a restricted diet or do daily exercises (or both)? There's a fatalistic streak in me that's saying, what will be will be, so why try and live in a way that feels punishing? I used to be afraid of dying suddenly, like my mum, but now I'm more afraid of living for a long time in an incapacitated state in some ghastly care home, getting more and more crabby (like my dad.) To be frank, I want the laws on euthanasia to change.Health, wellbeing and appearanceYou just can't tell how healthy someone is by looking at them. Some celebrities look fine, then you find out that their lives have been dominated by an eating disorder for decades. Some look overweight but seem fitter than people who are thinner. There are very obvious disabilities and ones which aren't visible at all and which have to be constantly explained to other people (and sometimes the other people don't believe you.) No, you just can't tell.Who isn't influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Even my parents and their blind friends picked up information from sighted people around them as to which film and TV stars were reckoned to be beautiful/handsome and why. Although my parents assessed people using different criteria - their tone of voice, accents, choice of language, whether they smoked, and even their physical slightness or bulk- they were still interested in what people looked like. Mum, who'd never had sight, knew that Sophia Loren with her voluptuous figure and pronounced cheekbones, was deemed to be beautiful in quite a different way to the petite, elfin Audrey Hepburn. Mum also knew that I admired different women to the ones her sisters adored. My Aunty L loved the glamorous Hollywood look, all big hair and make-up that must have taken hours to perfect, while my teenage idols were 'natural' looking women: Carly Simon, Stevie Nicks and Katharine Ross.8J7420: Autumn 2020, Everyday Health & WellbeingIn your teens, you are influenced by popular ideals to a huge extent. You do your make-up and hair and wear the clothes that are in fashion, regardless of whether such styles suit you (or suit anybody, for that matter) because you just want to fit in. One of my favourite comedy lines of recent years is from Derry Girls, when the girls all decide to be 'individual' and daringly turn up at school in denim jackets. On the day, only one of them has actually had the nerve to do this and she furiously stuffs the jacket into her bag, wailing 'I'm not being individual on my own!'Just look at eyebrows. I hated plucking my eyebrows into a thin line in the 70's (the permanently startled look), but it was what you did. Not doing it was another sign that you were hairy and unfeminine. What a relief when it became OK to have proper eyebrows (even if you still had to pluck a bit to keep them tidy.) Then, how I laughed when, decades later, young women began defacing their faces with huge, triangular brows that looked as if two black slugs had landed.This slavery to conform and ignore your own body does fade - well it has with me, anyway. I don't care what the current fashion is for eyebrows but I still spend a bit of time on mine because if I didn't I'd look like Bernard Ingham, all iron grey barbed wire shooting off in every direction. And I still look at other women and think, my God, what are you doing to yourself! The difference is that I don't say (or write) anything much about the crimes against their bodies or their image (other than to my dearest friends) because women are entitled to wear too-tight tops or draw rings around their lips if they want. And l might be accused of slut-shaming or letting down the sisterhood or something.The two health/beauty products I couldn't live without are Neutrogena hand cream and Nivea lip salve, and I take both with me wherever l go. Fortunately, they're both nice and cheap. And if I had to pick one for a desert island, I'd take the hand cream and hope it worked on my lips as well as everywhere else.Getting ready to leave the houseI was a bit bemused by being asked to think about my parents getting ready to go out. They both had few clothes. Dad kept his for ever and wore a succession of items which were very similar but graded according to age and decrepitude. He only got a new coat/shirt etc, when it became an emergency. So the outfit was much the same (tailored trousers, shirt, short jacket or overcoat) whether he was going to work, a school open day or a classical concert, it was just a matter of choosing new or old.Mum did have different outfits for different occasions. She wore old skirts and blouses with a pinny or housecoat over the top for staying in, smarter versions for going to the shops or the hairdressers or out to see her friends or for a meal, and some nice dresses and fancier shoes and handbags when she had a 'do' to attend. She never wore trousers. I used to help her buy clothes and put her outfits together and check her make-up before she went out. She used to say that it was lovely to have a daughter who could advise her like this.9t	IJ7420: Autumn 2020, Everyday Health & WellbeingMy routine? I'll have showered and done my hair that morning, so I'd wash my face again, do my make-up (on autopilot), put on perfume and get changed. I'll have chosen the outfit and probably changed my mind about three times, in my head over the course of the day. My wardrobe ranges• from house-scruffy, through various stages of messy-casual and smart-casual to 'OK for a meal out ina smartish restaurant.' If I ever had to attend a posh 'do' (perish the thought), I'd have to buy something specially and that would stress me out no end. If I ever had to meet the Queen, I'd be mysteriously indisposed with something infectious that might endanger the monarch's life. That would get me out of the dress, the shoes, the hat (aargh - the hat!) and - worst of all - the curtseying. No, no, no.10"

I believe that if you are unhappy, not just having a bad day, but in your normal disposition, or experience a prolonged episode of unhappiness, it can be detrimental to your overall health. I speak from experience; having had a bad relationship and a job I began to dread. My sleep was interrupted, I developed IBS, my feelings of self-worth plummeted, I was an emotional wreck in an otherwise fit and healthy body. It can be difficult to stay positive all the time but if you find what works for you (for me it is walking, being in nature, cycling and creativity), you should set aside time to do that, and see it as just as important as healthy eating or exercise. Next would be ‘active’. Regardless of your capabilities, I feel it so important to keep moving, walking, running, stretching, yoga, taking the dog out, dancing, cycling, doing the housework. Whatever you can manage within your own limits, just do it, get out there, sweat a little, push yourself even. Rather than thinking of fitness being ‘exercise’ which makes it feel like you should be doing some kind of sport or class, thinking of it as movement or mobility is a better approach. This will also help with maintaining the first word. ‘Fed’, to be well fed -as in a having good diet -is also important. I am a coeliac and cannot eat gluten. Diagnosed at an early age, I have always been aware of reading ingredients, checking what is in my food. I can’t eat a lot of junk or convenience food, so I learned to cook and prepare my own food at a young age. I was vegetarian for 15 years until I decided to introduce fish into my diet for health reasons. I grew vegetables organically in my garden allotment for many years, knowing the provenance of my food has become more important as I grow older. During the pandemic I have prepared pretty much every meal I eat myself, and although I was making most of them before anyway, this has increased the satisfaction of eating a lovingly prepared meal, made to my exact taste with fresh ingredients. Now in my middle age, I fully appreciate the benefits of being ‘Rested’. Having a good night’s sleep can be harder to achieve as you age. I have suffered from interrupted sleep on and off throughout my life. I wasn’t a good sleeper as a youngster and had bouts of insomnia at college. If I’m worried, I will have a bad night, either I can’t go to sleep or I wake up and toss and turn. Developing tinnitus at 18 caused huge problems, I listened to low level music to help me drift off for many years. I truly believe you should listen to your body, when you feel tired or run down, plan an early night. I have recently started to get up earlier in the morning to go for a walk before work (in winter I feel I don’t get enough time outside in the daylight as I work in an office) and I think this has a triple benefit, more exercise, helps with my feeling of wellbeing and makes me ‘good tired’ (as in physically tired through being active, rather than drained which is ‘bad tired’) at the end of the day which can aid sleep. When people think of the word ‘spiritual’ or ‘spirituality’ I imagine they would connect it to religion at one end of the scale and ‘hippy nonsense’ at the other. To be honest, both are fine with me and everything in between. I am not religious, but I come alive in nature. I connect. It makes my spirit soar to see a buzzard circling above me on a walk, to see the majestic colours of a sunrise. I do an hour of yoga once a week followed by a relaxation where I have regularly had an almost ‘out of body experience’. I feel calm and restored afterwards. I embrace all these opportunities to tune into F7368 myself, my spiritual side. Maybe some people wouldn’t equate this to being healthy but, to me, it completes the circle to be healthy in mind, body and spirit. Growing up my mum was always trying the latest health fad or diet. From the vibrating belt in the 1970’s to red and green days diets in the 1990’s, she spent decades (and no small fortune) on contraptions and subscriptions, none of which were successful. There was always some unused contraption gathering dust in their bedroom, that had promised to work miracles on your abs, bum or tum, but never delivered as she simply didn’t have the commitment. I don’t remember her as being particularly overweight as a child but in my teens, and her forties, she ballooned. At her heaviest she was wearing size 22 clothes. Eventually she was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and after medication had helped right her metabolism, she lost the weight steadily over four years and never regained it. Prior to this, it was the search for the quick fix. She had always been ‘big’ since childhood, in her opinion, and I think this had an effect on her mental health over the years. A constant struggle with her weight and unhappiness with her appearance made her prone to periods of depression and anxiety that culminated in a hospital admission. She simply stopped eating and wouldn’t get out of bed. My Dad was, and still is at almost eighty, a very active person. He was a television engineer by trade, and he would also do repairs at home in the loft conversion of our bungalow, carrying huge tube television sets up the extendable ladders. Eventually working for himself, he was putting in fourteen-hour days, every day. He did a bit of cycling, was involved with a local scout group and helped the work parties at their camp, building huts, chopping down trees. He never stopped, and although he has had two major heart surgeries in his fifties, then seventies, he is still out every day, chopping wood for his wood burner, building cabinets, shelves, little projects for friends and families, painting, decorating, he is an accomplished clay pigeon shooter, hefting a shotgun up, taking the kickback in his shoulder. I am in awe of him. As a family, we were never very active together. My mum taught me to swim from a very young age and I remember she took me to the swimming baths every Sunday morning up to around the age of seven nor eight. The mismatch of my parent’s interests and my Dad’s work meant we spent very little time together. I would holiday with my Mum in a family friend’s caravan while my Dad carried on working, we simply couldn’t afford him not to be working. We would walk our dog along the beach, and I would swim in the freezing brown water. Occasionally we would go for a day out, I called it the family fall out as we all irritated each other in close quarters of the car, but it would rarely involve anything physical, more a visit to somewhere, a look round the shops, a cafe stop. They once decided, on a whim, to visit a local nature reserve on the way home from a family get together and there was a warden doing guided trips. I was dressed in a bright yellow jacket, not having been prepared for the impromptu bird watching and the look of disbelief in my attire that the warden gave me has never left me. At school, health was called sport. It was called swimming (which I was ok at) and badminton, running, gymnastics, hockey, netball, rounders, and all the others you can think of (which I was not). As a girl it was never football, cricket our rugby. I decided at an early age that it was just not for me. If you didn’t excel at any of the above, you were discounted. No other alternatives offered. Picked last for everything, laughed at. When we did the occasional cross country running through the local park, I would call at home and have a brew with my mum as we lived close to the school, tag on at the back as they looped back past the house. I hated sport. We had home economics where we learned how to make a pineapple upside down cake and biology where we learned embarrassing things about our bodies. None of these were ever connected together. Wellbeing hadn’t been invented then. Puberty was an awful time. There seemed to be huge importance put on starting your periods as early as possible (I was late at 14). I never had much of a bust. I was uncomfortable in my skin, I had puppy fat and the memory of all those redundant exercise contraptions. I needed to be thinner, prettier, with big breasts, have long blonde hair, taller, sportier. I was none of these. It wasn’t until I was around 15 and met some different people, who listened to different music and F7368 wore goth style clothes and make up that I began to be happy with my appearance. I died my hair black, wore black eyeliner, boots and fishnet tights. I stopped caring what my peers at school thought. I had my own identity. I didn’t need to conform. When I left home and started work, I started swimming again. I think I had always enjoyed being in the water, but I also began to feel the buzz of pushing myself physically. I swam for an hour; I swam a mile. Later I would try running but this didn’t suit me, I kept getting little injuries. I joined a gym and started doing classes, mainly spin class but also pilates, yoga and some circuits. I never considered myself a ‘gym goer’ but until the closure of gyms last year I has been a member for over 15 years. I did enjoy the convenience of a led class, over quickly, done and dusted straight after work. I would get home and feel energized and tired in equal measures. Then, in my early thirties, I got a bike. This has to be the defining moment in realizing that exercise (sport even) is for me. I felt at one with my bike. I got a better one, a mountain bike and would go riding up in the local moorland. With my husband, who had been a keen cyclist for years (I had resisted), we went to trail centres, to the lakes, wooded cloughs and rode. We rode some of the Pennine trail in mid-winter, nearly breaking ourselves, we went to Majorca with our road bikes, we went to France and followed stages of Le Tour. I had found my perfect exercise, my happy place. Fitness and wellbeing followed but it was for the pure joy of riding that I did it. The good outcomes were a bonus. Now, in my late forties I still ride, but I do a lot more walking. We live on a narrowboat so there is always a ready-made walk straight from the door. This year I have started to walk in the morning before work for half an hour. Getting up in the dark and walking back to the sunrise helps both physically and mentally. I also walk most lunchtimes, do an hour of yoga once a week and try to get out on my bike at weekends in the winter. In the summer I ride two or three times a week. I am probably more aware of my body now but in a different way. I don’t aim for thin, I want to be strong, supple, active. Living on a boat means physical work, pushing a wheelbarrow full of shopping down the towpath, pulling on ropes, working the locks. It my aim to be able to do these for as long as possible. Like most people, I access the internet to research about health and nutrition but in all honesty, I don’t really do very much of this. I know enough about a healthy diet from past experience and I don’t overly concern myself with new trends or fads. I know what I enjoy, what I should do in moderation. I drink but try to be sensible, I no longer smoke having given up in my early thirties. I don’t eat meat, only fish. I prepare most of my own food from scratch, sharing recipe ideas with a colleague at work who shares the same interests in healthy eating. I am physically active every day. I don’t have any beauty regimes as such, I don’t wear make up. I developed exercise induced asthma (probably as a result of smoking) when I had a brief go at running and so I always have my inhaler with me (thankfully I don’t have to use it very often). I don’t do much with my hair (super curly). I think I’m pretty low maintenance. Apart from a bit of moisturizer, I do very little to prepare myself before I leave the house. My mum would always pop a bit of eyeshadow on before going out but she was never really one for getting ‘dolled up’. I’m not sure of my Dad ever looked in the mirror much! Regardless of their faults, my parents never put much importance on what you looked like. This was not where a person’s value came from. I have, from time to time, fallen victim to thinking I should look a certain way, and as I age, I see my face change, my skin crease and line, my body become less firm. But I have managed to stay happy and healthy though a mixture of exercise, diet and not worrying too much about what other people think."

I am a social worker by background, and currently work for a charity that trains graduates to work as mental health social workers. My job involves setting up and overseeing the trainees’ practice placements in community mental health teams. My MO number is T7345. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? I find it hard to separate my definitions of these two words. They both make me think about freedom from illness (physical or mental) but also something more positive than that – my body and mind feeling generally good and being able to respond positively to challenges, whether that be a more strenuous session of exercise or a mentally or emotionally taxing period in my life. I think of health as something that can be present or absent, a positive or a negative, in good health or in poor health – whereas I see wellbeing a positive concept that everyone has more or less of at different points during their lives. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Fit; strong; eating well; sleep; resilient. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. I think of times when I have been really enjoying a run, muscles fully warmed up, in a nice rhythm, feeling like I’m absolutely flying. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Gender: The impact of my gender on my health and well-being feels multi-faceted. I believe strongly that there are huge pressures on women in terms of their body shape and physical appearance, and have seen these pressures have a significant impact on many of my friends’ self-esteem and lifestyle choices. However, my body shape is slim and remains so without too much effort from myself, leaving me privileged in terms of the match between my appearance and how society expects women to look. I feel that this match – which I perceive as more to do with genetics than anything else, given the resemblance to my mother’s body shape -has contributed to the fact that I am pretty body-confident. A little while ago I read a book about women and sport – and more specifically, the barriers that women experience to exercising regularly. This book was a bit of a revelation for me, as lots of the structural issues that the author identifies felt very relevant to explaining why I didn’t exercise regularly and reap the health and well-being benefits of this during much of my teens and twenties. Finally, I think societal expectations around female behaviour have contributed negatively to my mental health over the years in ways in which I am only just beginning to understand and unpick. Women being socialised to support others, to disregard their own needs, emotions and preferences, not to speak out … these are patterns of behaviour that I recognise in my own life and that have not contributed to my good mental health. Ethnicity: I have thought about this a lot more recently, further to different discussions coming out of the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME people in the UK. I am white, and have become more aware this year than ever before that my experience of the National Health Service as largely efficient and supportive is part of my white privilege. One statistic that crystallised this for me is that black women in the UK are five times more likely to die in childbirth than white women. I became a mother in 2019, with amazing support from the midwifery and obstetrics team at the hospital where my son was born. This statistic really drove home to me the inequalities that exist in the UK today around access to effective and sometimes life-saving healthcare. Social class: My financial status and social class definitely impact on my health and well-being. I have the time and money to commit to eating healthily, exercising and resources to support my mental health (self-help books, meditation apps, therapy if required). Within my social circle, I mix with others who are in a similar position, which helps to motivate me and affirm the importance of looking after my body and mind. Sexual orientation: I’ve never thought about this one, likely because I belong to the privileged or normative group in terms of sexual orientation (heterosexual). I’m aware however of times when gay friends have felt disadvantaged or discriminated against when seeking healthcare support, and am aware that I don’t face similar barriers of discrimination or omission as has been the case in their experience – which can only have promoted my health and wellbeing. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Health feels like a concept that I’ve always been aware of – because perhaps because one of its opposites, illness, is something that one experiences quite a lot of in childhood (colds, ear infections, viruses etc). Wellbeing feels like a much newer concept that I’ve only heard discussed in the last few years. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My parents. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Only in snatches. I remember for example my dad telling me all the different reasons why it was important to clean my teeth – to avoid toothache, so my teeth would look nice, so my breath would smell good … I think in their behaviour they showed me different ways in which they valued health and well-being, however. For example, we always went out for walks at the weekend, which I think was linked to their belief that exercise and being outside was good for all of us in lots of different ways. My mum ensured that we got our feet measured regularly, had all our childhood vaccinations and went to the dentist as often as was recommended. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Again, I only remember snatches of health education at school. A scary video about the dangers of using illegal drugs – a bit of sex education (I don’t really remember the content of the lesson, more the novelty that our parents had to sign a disclaimer so we could attend.) I read magazines like Just 17 when I was a teenager which I’m pretty sure had content about health. And there were community resources – I went to a youth health organisation when I became sexually active and wanted to start taking the contraceptive pill, for example. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I remember my mum talking to me about periods. We must have been on our own in the house as I was having a bath without the door locked, and she came in and asked if I knew what a period was. I said that I thought it meant that you bleed when you have a wee. I know that she explained it in a bit more detail than that (!) but I can’t really remember what she said or how old I was (probably quite young, if I wasn’t locking the door when having a bath?) Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I remember having my first period, and being excited about changing my sanitary towel because of the novelty of it. I remember it was difficult at school to change sanitary towels at each break/lunchtime as not-so-nice kids hung around in the toilet and would notice if you kept going in there and make sarcastic comments. I don’t remember buying my first bra – I think maybe I went with my mum to Marks & Spencers to get it fitted? – perhaps because there was a fashion when I was a teenager to wear crop tops before you really needed a bra so the transition to bra didn’t feel like such a big deal. One moment I remember as being particularly difficult was shaving my legs for the first time. I felt really embarrassed that my legs were getting hairy and that other girls might notice in PE, but also found it hard to pluck up the courage to ask my mum for support to buy razors and shaving gel and to show me how to do it. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? In recent years I feel like I’ve done much more to maintain my health, both mentally and physically. One important factor is my current relationship, which began in 2015. My partner has always exercised regularly, and being with him motivated me to do the Couch to 5k programme so we could run together. Running is now a regular part of my life and my main form of exercise. He is also vegetarian and more mindful of healthy eating than I had been prior to meeting him. A few years into our relationship, when my meat-and fish-eating had dwindled substantially, I decided to become vegetarian too. I am also more thoughtful about my mental health now than was the case when I was younger. I try to meditate and write in a journal regularly and also listen to podcasts and read material about mental health, happiness and well-being. I try to use ideas from these materials to enhance my happiness – for example taking time every day to note three things I am grateful for. I can’t put my finger on what has motivated me to do so in the same way that I can identify that being with my partner has helped me to improve my physical health. I think at some point I realised that working on one’s mental health isn’t an activity confined to people with a diagnosed mental health condition – we all have mental health which can be better or worse at different points, and we can all do things to protect and promote our mental health. I also realised in my late twenties that I was finding some aspects of my life harder than I needed to, and that maybe this wasn’t inevitable and was something I could work on. The success I had at this point in understanding myself and implementing strategies to feel better and happier about my life gave me the motivation to continue this sort of reflection and ongoing quest for better mental health. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? NHS website; GP. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? Probably less aware of my body than I have been for a while. When I was single and dating I was more conscious of my body as a object of desire to potential partners – and then more recently I was trying to conceive, then pregnant, then breastfeeding, all of which made my body very present to me. These periods of my life being over means that at the moment I think less about my body on a day-to-day basis. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I don’t have a very detailed answer to this question. I’d like to continue with the things I do at the moment to promote my health and well-being, and in particular to make running a bigger part of my life and to do some longer-distance races. Moving into middle age, the menopause and older age, with the possibility for my body to become more infirm, feels like a long way away at the moment and not something I can imagine. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? I see this relationship as not at all straightforward. External appearance -and judgements that follow from this about an individual’s health and well-being -is often judged by how closely the way they look resembles a popular ideal. I feel like these judgements are often flawed – saying that because a person looks a certain way they must be healthy or unhealthy is objectively not correct. An obvious example is weight – while there are some health risks associated with being very over-or underweight, my understanding is that the relationship between whether a person looks fat or thin and their overall health is much more complex than the simple thin = healthy / fat = unhealthy assumption that permeates our culture. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Without a doubt and probably in many more ways than I am aware, as I think these ideals are so omnipresent and pernicious in our culture for women in particular. One particular example that I am aware of is that I felt really pleased and a little proud when my body returned to its pre-pregnancy shape quite quickly after I gave birth to my son. It annoyed me that I felt this way, as this response ran so counter to my values and to my knowledge of what is entirely normal in women’s post­partum bodies. The only explanation I can think of for my emotional response is that it was informed by popular ideals about female body shape which I have absorbed. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Something I’m really appreciative of is that I don’t feel my mum paid much attention to ideals of beauty or physical appearance, and it was certainly never something that she made a part of my childhood. Girlie dressing up games and Barbie dolls were not something that she encouraged and I never heard her speak negatively about her body or anyone else’s body. I think this was hugely important in fostering a sense of body confidence in me that has lasted until this day – in comparison to some friends who were very aware of their mothers’ concerns about their own body or their daughters’ bodies, concerns that had a lasting impact on how my friends viewed their own physical appearance. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Moisturising cream and lip balm Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? I don’t remember much about this, but I remember my mum always wearing jewellery when going out for the evening and me playing with her jewellery as a little girl. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My routine has definitely changed over time. In my twenties I would always wear make-up for work and definitely for socialising and would also often dry straighten my hair. Now I very rarely wear make-up so my routine is shower, deodorant, moisturise, hair product to make my hair curly, watch/jewellery – and that’s it. When going out for a night out with friends in my teens and twenties we would often spend a couple of hours getting ready together – having a few drinks and a natter as we did our hair and make-up. Sometimes this was the most fun bit of the whole night for me, just hanging out, catching up and pampering ourselves. It feels a long time since we have been able to do this, what with my pregnancy and then the pandemic, but I’m really looking forward to being able to spend time like this with my girlfriends again."

We are usually pretty active, and so the lockdown rules regarding exercise outside of the home were hard to swallow. That said, our physical health has not suffered too much. We have walked, plus have a skipping rope and a mini step machine at home. We have not required any medical or professional help during this period. Our emotions have been up and down. It is hard not being able to see family, especially since my father recently had CV19 (recovered, thankfully) – I just wanted to be with my mother. Most of the time, emotionally, it’s ok. It’s only when we really start to think about what a crazy situation we’re in it becomes harder to manage. Neither of us have had panic attacks, but we have found it both stressful & hysterical, on and off. Difficult to describe. The Government I am in utter despair. I don’t believe they have made one good timely decision, and I absolutely distrust everything they say. I believe that they will re-open the economy too soon – relax the lockdown rules, I mean. I think we will see further cases. News I have tried not to look at the news too much – see ‘despair’, above. I look at The Guardian online, and Twitter, to get a general gist. We have not been watching the daily 5pm briefings. Mainly because it doesn’t suit us to, and also I don’t want to because I can’t believe a word that anyone at one of those podiums says, and I find their answers to be non-answers and it makes me frustrated and cross. I don’t know anyone who struggles to access the news. I think it is a good idea to be more inclusive, and I fully support the presence of a BSL interpreter. Work & Home Life I was furloughed during April. I was brought back to work (from home) at the beginning of May. Being furloughed was tough – my wife has been too, but she will be going back to work from next Monday 18th – but I managed to create a new routine – some exercise, we did some jigsaw puzzles, reading, writing. Even gardening. We usually take our walk in the evenings, which is a nice end to the day. Working from home is ok. I have a good set-up and I am in contact with my team and other colleagues via Teams daily. There are no children in the house. I couldn’t imagine having that additional pressure. My wife and I are enjoying spending so much time together and have generally found much to laugh about. We have shared ‘socially-distanced’ drinks with our neighbours over the back fence. The sunshine during April helped a lot. Technology We had already been using Teams at work, but it has been a really useful tool for keeping in touch with my colleagues – both in my immediate team and throughout the company. I use Teams to chat with a small group of friends every fortnight or so – this has been initiated since the lockdown. Wife & I also use Teams to talk to her siblings every week or so. I was using WhatsApp anyway, but now have been using it for video calls a bit more – mainly to the same group of people that I message; it is nice to see faces. I have just started using Zoom. My mum likes it because she can use her laptop and see us on a big screen, rather than on her phone (smaller) via WhatsApp. I am only using Zoom with my family. I have not reconnected with anybody. I am in touch with the people I want to be in touch with, and I don’t feel obliged to reach out. I dislike Facebook, and my use of it has not changed. Ditto Twitter, although I use it now to escape from everything as well as to see the news. There are some funny things on Twitter. Shopping & Food I have driven to Big Sainsbury’s once every fortnight since lockdown began. At first it was very strange – dystopian – and there wasn’t much available. My third trip was yesterday, and it seems much more ‘new normal’ although there are still some items in short supply. I have not had any trouble finding what I need, however, and even if there was I could do without or find alternatives. The bigger supermarket is a weird experience. I haven’t enjoyed it much. One feels almost criminal. I have glanced at online shopping, but there are no slots. During the week we top up our shopping – milk, fresh fruit & veg – at the little Tesco Express down the road. I go early in the morning (0620hrs or so) when it is quiet. We have been planning our meals more, and also using food we have – tinned food and food from the freezer. Our habits have generally stayed the same. Entertainment & Leisure I have been blogging – I started a blog at the beginning of my furlough leave. And I have been continuing to learn French (using Duolingo), which I had already been doing since the start of the year. I have done some alternative exercising – I am used to going for runs, or taking more walks – so I now do skipping in the morning, and some steps on the step machine at lunchtime. We have been doing more gardening – wife painted the shed, and we trimmed the bushes in the front garden. Our DIY skills are limited… We both read a lot – I am reading a wine book, currently, alongside Elton John’s autobiography. Wife is reading some fiction alongside Cathy Newman’s Bloody Brilliant Women. I have been listening to Jameela Jamil’s podcast, I Weigh. Wife has got audible. We listen to books together (The Secret Barrister’s book at the moment) and she has her own books she listens to as well. When it all gets too much, we watch some silly movies. We watched all three Pitch Perfect movies recently, and Finding Dory as well. On Netflix we watched Wanderlust, Dr Foster, and currently, After Life. We have got Pose on the go, and a few other things that we dip in and out of. We have a lot of Poirot recorded off the telly. They are terrible but they do the trick, sometimes. For laughs, we watch Brooklyn 99. Personal Hygiene We both shower every morning, wash our hair when it needs washing, and get dressed in proper clothes. I still put on a little eye makeup because I think it makes me look a little less haggard. Neither of us have been wearing our bras. Why would we? As far as I can tell, our personal hygiene habits have not altered. Sleep I am a terribly sleeper anyway, so I don’t think my sleep has been any different. I don’t think my wife’s has either. We both have work-based anxiety that is different from CV19 anxiety – work stuff occasionally keeps my wife awake, but on the whole our sleep is no different. I rarely remember my dreams, sorry."

No. W3163 Age: 63. Occupation: Retired. Location: St Gennys, Cornwall. Marital Status: Married Date: 11th March 2021 Subject: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body I think of health as being free from illness, and pain injury and wellbeing more as a state of mind; as healthy, happy and comfortable. If you’re in pain, injured or ill you’re wellbeing is likely to be detrimentally affected. Five words – weight; fitness; nutrition; sufficient sleep; fresh air. Images of people who are said to be fit and healthy always depict super slim, super fit people. This can make us mere mortals feel a little uncomfortable or inferior as it’s not the norm and unachievable for a lot of people for various reasons. To my mind, the adage of ‘moderation in all things’ is an appropriate approach. Identity I can’t help but wonder what gender, ethnicity, social class or sexual orientation has to do with a person’s health – it certainly has nothing to do with mine. Wellbeing could be affected if you are unhappy or uncomfortable with any of these things but that is an entirely different case and as I don’t have any issues with any of the above mentioned they don’t affect my wellbeing. Growing up/learning about health and wellbeing Health and wellbeing are things which have never been at the forefront of my mind. It seems to me that it’s something which has become an ‘in’ thing in more recent years – possibly due to advertising of products and supplements which are supposed improve your health and appearance. W3163 As a child my parents had the responsibility of taking care of me – after all that is part of the roll of a parent. Health was never a subject of discussion at home or school and I don’t recall it being something that was talked about among friends or school pals. It’s still not something that exercises my mind. Key moments I suppose I first became aware of bodily changes around age 12 or so. I can’t think of any specific moments to talk about here. You know you are going to grow into an adult and if things didn’t change that would be something to be concerned about. Growing older I think it’s obvious by now that this is not a subject I spend any time thinking about. I’ve always been physically active and that’s because I enjoy it, not because I’m concerned with my health. Health, wellbeing and appearance I’m not sure health and wellbeing are related to external appearance generally save to say that if someone is obviously overweight it’s likely they will have other related health issues. I don’t follow any ideals of beauty, as the saying goes ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’. My mother was and to some extent still is very vain and always had to have what she considered stylish, fashionable clothing and makeup. Clearly I didn’t take after her! Items I couldn’t live without; nail clippers and or files. I hate long nails. Getting ready to leave the house I don’t go to work and haven’t been out socially for a year now!! But I don’t do much if I do go out – probably just comb my hair! I used to wear eye makeup but a long time ago."

Wellbeing to me is a sense of how I feel mentally and physically. I’m more conscious of wellbeing this year. For example on the days I get to go in the office I have a strong sense of wellbeing to the point where I dread the following day working from home and not being able to have a natural conversation with a person or group of people while looking at them. ‘a healthy body’ in five words: disease-free, able, fit, energetic, well. The person that comes to mind for me is a Blond Ambition era Madonna. Fit, energetic, able. Identity It’s hard to say whether my experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by things such as my gender and ethnicity as I cannot separate myself from those things. Saying that, it has been influenced by how I relate to media images of women and comparing myself to them. For example, thinking that women on TV and in films represented what I should look like when I grew up. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Health and wellbeing are things that I became aware of (maybe without those specific titles) relatively early on. Both my parents were mental health nurses, so in that sense, hearing their conversations about their jobs, it was impossible not to be aware of health. Also, as my mother became ill when I was a teenager, ending her career, that was a strong lesson for me in the importance of staying healthy. A what not to do type of lesson. I can’t say I was very aware of health when I was a child; I ate what I liked and did what I liked in terms of playing. I didn’t have a consciousness of doing things because they were healthy. Both my parents were overweight and I never had anyone telling me to watch what I ate. However, for the most part I didn’t overeat or become unhealthily overweight. I don’t remember any particular lessons about health in school, other than being shown a video about periods in the last year of primary school. There was no internet back then, and to be honest, I wasn’t that interested in health. The one thing I do remember about health when I was growing up was the AIDS crisis – who could forget, living through it? All those tombstone adverts. That of course worried me growing up, not that I’ve ever knowingly met anyone with AIDS but the adverts caused a lasting impression. Key moments I first became aware of bodily changes when I was about 11 – I noticed my waist curved in. Then I waited for the breasts to arrive. Still waiting. Although not much in need of it, I remember my mum taking me to get my first bras. The first time I wore one to school, a boy pulled the back of of it. I remember my first period. I was scared it would happen at a bad time. It wasn’t too bad, but not too great either. It was in the summer holidays after first year at secondary school, so I was twelve. My friend and I went down to stay with my grandparents in Clevedon. We were taken down by my dad, so it was a bit awkward, saying I needed to get sanitary products. I actually hated having my periods from the very first. They seemed messy painful and pointless to me. It always seemed unfair to me that women had to have them. I always wished they’d just stop on their own, but while I sometimes had extra weeks between them, I never missed one. After the first day it was a bit better; I was with a friend who’d already started her periods so that was helpful. The most cringey moment was when we were watching TV and the Golden Girls episode where they talk about their first periods was on. I wanted to sink through the floor. Growing older My first real issue with stress was when I was studying for my A Levels. I had been down before, but never anxious like that. The stress and anxiety hit me and I could not eat. I felt sick all the time. The weird thing was, before that I thought I had to eat to function, now I had a lesson in not eating and still functioning which is probably a very bad thing to happen to a teenager. At the time I was a little overweight, but I wasn’t worried or self conscious about it. I wouldn’t say I was fat, just a little plump, at the time, I didn’t think about it at all. I’d always ate what I liked and when I was younger I could get away with it because I was growing. I was never that bothered by food – I liked chocolate and could have as much as I wanted, but at Easter I asked to have toys instead as I couldn’t eat all the eggs I got. But then I lost weight – I didn’t eat much more than having a pint of milk for breakfast and my evening meal. I worked at the time at a cleaning job in an office. I had holiday and when I came back I had comments from some of the men who worked in the office who noticed I’d lost weight. I wasn’t exercising, just going to college, doing my cleaning job. I didn’t even think about exercise. Once I lost the weight that was when I started being more conscious of what I looked like and what size I was. I wanted to stay slimmer, but I didn’t feel in control because I hadn’t done anything deliberately to lose weight; it was a side effect of anxiety. That’s when I started to become aware of what I ate and think about it. A year before I finished my degree, a friend who I was planning to go on holiday with mentioned she used the gym. So I gave it a go, the idea being to look good for the holiday. Actually, my first session at the gym left me feeling high. I felt like I could breathe and it made me feel like I could do anything. I had had mild asthma and both my parents had it a lot worse (as well as being overweight). So while I started going to the gym to look better, I ended up continuing to go because of how it made me feel, and it the hope that it would protect me from getting ill like my parents. Inevitably I pushed to the limit and while doing my finals I felt really high from being ready for it and exercising, I crashed the day after I finished. All that time with an unhealthy view of food also caught up with me. I went to America as an au pair for a year and suffered with boredom a lot of the time, the opposite of the stress of studying for so long, which led to overeating in a country where sugar is in pretty much everything. That was the only time I was seriously overweight. I came home, got a retail job, went back to the gym and ate normal food. So in the end after swinging between anxiety and boredom I got to a level. One thing, I’ve never been on a diet. I couldn’t do it. I am clearly an emotional eater (eat when I’m bored, stop when I’m stressed), which is something I’ve had to be aware of this year. Being stuck at home is a little close to that year as an au pair, isolated in a foreign country on my own a lot of the time. Difference is I’m not living in leggings and I don’t have time to be bored. But there is no way in hell I could set up my desk in the kitchen, as some people I know have done. I have to keep to my exercise routine and wear jeans. The worst problem I had with anxiety was in my early thirties when I ended up off sick with work related stress. At the time I’d stopped exercising. I had my kit set up at home, but was spending so much time in work I didn’t have time for it. So I got mentally and physically out of shape. When I was off sick I made a point of getting back into a regular exercise routine. Since then I’ve stuck to it pretty rigidly. It helped me mentally too. I felt good after exercise but also felt a sense of achievement. I know that there is a link between physical and mental health – I’ve been there. This is what keeps me exercising. I don’t do much but half an hour of cardio and a few weights five days a week seems to work for me. I don’t pay too much attention to magazines or media stories about health because of being shaped by my own experiences. I just try to eat reasonably sensibly and exercise. I feel thankful that I was able to lose the extra weight after the au pair year, and I just want to stay the same size now, if I can. I feel good as I am. In future if I can’t keep up the cardio (rowing machine and exercise bike) I think I’ll do more walking. One thing I’ve started doing recently is cycling. I bought a bike when dad moved into the home in town. I cycle over to see him most of the time now and I actually really enjoy it. I’ve never been an outdoorsy person but cycling round the estate reminds me of when I had a bike as a child; it’s actually fun! Health, wellbeing and appearance I used to think external appearance was very much related to health. Now I know better. I’ve looked good and been extremely unhealthy (see above). I’ve come out of the gym feeling great and looking a complete mess. Saying that, I do love getting dressed up and staying fit helps me fit into those fancy clothes I like. But just cos I look good doesn’t mean I’m feeling great at the time. But I do think getting dressed up can make you feel better. I have made a point of getting properly dressed every day so I feel like I’m in the office (even if the dressing gown goes on top cos I’m cold). And every time I go into the office I dress up smart, do my hair and makeup. I even bought some new perfume recently – I hadn’t been wearing perfume this year, reasoning that whatever I chose would be the fragrance of 2020 forever. But I fancied a perfume I hadn’t had for a while and it was a treat to wear it. I have absolutely been influenced by popular ideals of beauty. When I was young I watched a lot of classic Hollywood films. At one point I thought becoming a grown-up meant waking up looking like Rita Hayworth one morning. Rita Hayworth in Cover Girl to be exact. I was destined for extreme disappointment. I also had a favourite Dolly Parton concert that we taped from TV and I watched a lot. I thought I’d have the face of Rita Hayworth and the chest of Dolly Parton. Needless to say, neither of those things happened. My parents were, sometimes embarrassingly, lacking in caring about their appearance. When they were younger they had fashion moments, but most of my life that wasn’t a thing. Therefore I felt extremely unprepared for makeup, grooming etc. In a way it was very positive in that I didn’t feel any pressure at home to look good, but a little would have been nice. I had to learn to do things myself and I still feel like a novice with beauty products; mostly just foundation and mascara for me. I’ve also always had acne, even now which seems cruel. I’ve had it since I was 13; you’d think it would be over by 45. Since lockdown I started using an expensive cleanser I had bought before but not really started using. Now I couldn’t do without it because it’s the only thing that seems to help (and I’ve been on Roaccutane). It is Environ Skin EssentiA cleansing lotion. I got talked into buying it on a cruise then started using it in earnest this year. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to get hold of it, but found a stockist in the UK. It’s expensive, but it works. Getting ready to leave the house From the above, you will gather that my parents were a bit short on ‘getting ready’ rituals. My own routine has changed, with the recent discovery of hair straighteners for when I wear my hair down, and the assistance of a work colleague who showed me (back in the days when we could go into the office) how to put a donut in my hair to make a nice fancy bun. It’s the only thing I can do with my hair and now it’s my go-to style for those rare days in the office. I also use foundation, eye liner (another relatively new development) and mascara. That with perfume and nice clothes is the effort. I think I’ve got better at choosing decent clothes so less fashion disasters than in the past. It’s just a shame that at the moment I don’t have anywhere to wear my clothes. My most recent clothes purchases are two zip-up fleeces from Lidl. And this was because a friend told me off for wearing my dressing gown during the day over my clothes! When I was younger I had no idea what I was doing with makeup and don’t remember using hairspray regularly, which for a teen of the 1980s is pretty unusual. I just had no idea. I’ve got to say that even with the signs of aging, I put myself together better now than I ever did as a youngster."

I have a rowing machine, stationary bike and weights at home and use them five days a week in the morning. As I am no longer driving into work, I don’t have to get up as early in the morning to fit in my exercise routine before starting work. I know I’m less active than I would be if I was going to the office each day and I do miss the long flight of stairs I walked up to my office every day. I’ve bought an exercise trampoline for between-times like when I’m waiting for the kettle to boil for a cup of tea. Mentally I’m OK – but I think I’ll feel it more as restrictions are lifted. Yesterday I had tears in my eyes when I saw that the Baker was open again. A little bit of normality back. I’m just taking it day by day and dealing with it, but it will be such a relief when we’re at least over this a bit. The Government I think there have been some very difficult decisions made and that we won’t be able to assess what the impact has been for years to come. I think it was right to bring in the lockdown and relatively easy compared to deciding on an exit strategy. This is unprecedented and mistakes will be made and undoubtably have been. I think we’ve done on balance not badly, but not particularly well in comparison to other countries. I think there will be more of the gradual easing of restrictions, there will be more confusion and more frustration that there has been until now. When the message was clear – stay at home – protect the NHS – save lives everyone understood that. It was absolute. The latest message doesn’t really mean anything, it’s just an attempt at a follow-up catchphrase. I see there is already an increase in testing and talk of tracing. There may also soon be more things opening. News At the start I watched the daily updates from the government. That was when there were big announcements like closing pubs/restaurants and schools). Now I tend to read the summaries on the BBC website (unless it’s going to be a big announcement). I feel like the government broadcasts are a good thing to have, but I don’t need to see them every day. They also run a bit long. I’ve got a bit of covid news fatigue now. Sometimes in the morning I watch CNN just for a change from UK news. I have the BBC News app on my phone which sent me alerts when Boris Johnson and Prince Charles were found to be positive. I don’t’ have any challenges getting the news – between the TV, BBC and Guardian apps and the odd newspaper, I feel like I’m overwhelmed with news about Covid. I know it’s a worldwide crisis, but I’m tired of it. Work and home life At the start of lockdown I was working on a laptop on a folding table. My elbow started to be painful. I haven’t gone to the Doctor about it because of lockdown. At work I normally have a rising desk so I can sit or stand because I have a bad knee. I don’t have that at home. Once my arm started to bother me I went into work and brought home peripherals (keyboard/mouse/docking station) and bought a stand so that I could raise my laptop up to the correct monitor height above the plugin keyboard. I also started using an ironing board as a desk so that I could stand up. I bought a bar stool after making sure it was exactly the right height for me to use at my temporary ‘standing desk’. I should be getting a breakfast bar delivered tomorrow to replace my increasingly wobbly ironing board set up. Again, I measured to ensure it is exactly the right height and depth and that it will fit in the spare bedroom. While I’d love a sit/stand desk, all of the ones I’ve seen are way too big for the space I have. I have a member of staff with back problems – one of our senior managers didn’t think we’d need to bring anything but laptops home for the duration – I told my member of staff to take their specialist chair if they needed it. I can see all sorts of enduring neck, back and leg problems coming out of the lockdown. I’m surprised that I’m relatively happy working at home. I used to feel isolated when I did so, but as the whole team (of around 20 people) is doing so, we are finding ways to communicate. I also think when we do call each other, we always chat more than we need to purely for work. That helps to make up for the social interaction we are missing from when we sat in the same office. My cat keeps me company every day (sometimes sitting on the ironing board, or on me, or on the bed next to the ironing board). That’s something I will miss going back to the office (if I ever do) and I think that the cat will miss it too. I actually feel more anxious about returning to work right now than staying where I am. The talk is of 25% maximum back in office with rules about which way to walk down a corridor, stairs which are for walking one way only (one set up the other set down) washing of desks and social distancing. That’s a lot to be thinking about when you’ve got a busy job already. I’d rather stay home. I know some people are really missing being physically in the same space, especially those who live on their own, but for me the constant worry related to being in the workplace outweighs the advantages. Also, I’m saving lots of money and wear on the car by not having a daily commute. I’m getting uplater and even if I finishlater at night,I close the laptop and I’m done. No commute. Because I’msobusy with work, the majority of my day is spent in the same way it was before lockdown, if at a different location. I talk to the same people and deal with the same tasks. I think that has helped my mental health. Most of the day I can ignore the context. My husband has been off work with (work-related) stress for the whole of the lockdown so far but is going back to work soon. But he’s been busy in the garden and now he can go back to playing golf. I make a point of having time away from him. Also, my work day means I see him for the same amount of time I normally would in the evenings. The only difference is the occasional cup of tea I get delivered. I feel very lucky to be working and not to have children. While being furloughed sounds nice (money for nothing) I know that if I was in that position I would be far more anxious than I am now and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it. Technology We already have whatsapp groups at work and now at home we have a ‘pub’ group. Workwise we use skype constantly for phone meetings and group messaging. At work we now have an optional zoom meeting every Friday for drinks and quiz; it’s nice to be able to see each other. At home we’ve started zoom meetings for the pub group. None of us had used zoom before and it isn’t always smooth, but it is helpful. Shopping and food At the beginning of lockdown I was most upset when the restriction on buying UHT milk came in – one or two cartons a time. Before this we’d buy 12/24 cartons at the beginning of the month and then not have to think about buying milk again until the following month. That’s something that’s happened in my house growing up for as long as I can remember. At the start we then went to buying 4/6 pint containers from the local shop. I had no idea how quickly I went through milk (and it is mostly me rather than my husband). Now, even with the restriction lifted, it’s still something we go to the shop for. It’s a reason toleave the house and walk to the local shop and for me it’s a symbol of lockdown. Once I feel like things are normal enough we’ll go back to bulk-buying UHT. But until then it’s a walk to the shop ever other day or so for the fresh stuff. I don’t normally dothefoodshopping as I don’t dothe cooking, sosupermarkets are not somewhere I used to spend much time. Now I dread going in to Morrisons in case there is a queue, if not outside then for the tills. I don’t mind going to the smaller shops but it’s all a lot more effort than normal. Husband cooks the same things as before and I eat them. I have also made a conscious effort to stick with my normal work-day eating. Since getting a desk job nearly 20 years ago I have been conscious of not burning that many calories at work. It helps that I’m busy working because I tend to eat when I’m bored. Entertainment and leisure I’m still watching what I normally would to keep entertained. I’m not into sports so it hasn’t affected me too much. I do miss going to the cinema. I generally watch films/TV drama to get away from current events, but sometimes I do catch myself seeing things in films that wouldn’t happen now – crowded airports, eating out and it seems weird that it was so normal a few months ago and now it isn’t. We watched Contagion. I enjoyed the film and felt it was in some ways realistic, in some ways not (where was the panic-buying of loo-rolls?). As I’m not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan I was pleased her character was the first to die. We watched Outbreak too which was rubbish – bomb a town to deal with the disease? We’ve finally got round to watching Friday Night Dinner, which is hilarious. One show per night and we’re nearly caught up. At work we play along on our skype group message with Radio 2’s Popmaster nearly every day. I’d never heard of it before this. I have gone from reading a biography of Marie Antoinette to Penny Jordan Mills & Boon. I think I’m regressing and it’s my way of doing something utterly brainless. I haven’t read Mills & Boon for years and it really is utter trash, but I just can’t stop. But at least it’s not affecting my waistline, as eating trash food would. I wish I had the spare time to do all these things other people are doing at this time. I stand in my spare room day after day working all day, staring out the window. I have to walk past the things in my house that I want to do. I have no more time than I did before, I just have the constant awareness that other people have spare time. But then I remind myself I’m extremely lucky to have a job. In the interests of self-improvement I started watching a performance of Carmen while I do my exercise. Half and hour of opera a day while cycling/rowing is about all the extra enrichment I have time for. I like to crochet but I just don’t feel motivated at the moment. Personal Hygiene I still get up every morning, exercise and shower. I wash my hair twice a week, as per normal. What I haven’t done since lockdown started is use any heat on my hair to dry or straighten it. I also haven’t used any hairspray. Sometimes I put my hair up for zoom meetings but it doesn’t have to last or withstand the outside world so no hairspray needed. Makeup is only for zoom meetings, but I do enjoy making the effort. Normally my hairdresser dyes my hair with foils and I’ve just passed the first cancelled appointment. I will not ruin my hair with box dye (why? Who’s looking?) I will rest it until I can go to the hairdresser. I can’t remember the last time I wore my contact lenses (which I used to wear most week days). Glasses are less effort. Contacts are better for driving (especially at night) but when am I going to do that again? I’ve started putting nail hardener on my nails once a week. I feel like my nails and hair are in hibernation. I’mkeepingthem healthy until they can come out to play again. I wear jeans most days that are stretchy but not that stretchy – I bought a load of clothes for my (cancelled) holiday and want to be able to fit in them once this is over. I mostly wear sports tops (non-iron) at the moment. I feellikeI’min aholdingpattern –keeptheroutine, stay healthy, don’t let things slide. It’s almost like waiting for your wedding – look after yourself, watch what you eat, exercise, look after nails and hair then you get to show it off at the end – main difference being we don’t have a date for the Big Day yet. Sleep I have terrible insomnia anyway, so no real change there. But I am having more anxiety dreams. The night before I drove to work to get my desk kit, I had bad dreams – I think because I was worried I’d get stopped by the police. Things that were normal before have become sources of anxiety. My husband has been sticking to a routine of getting up and going to bed at normal times, as have I. I do get up later because I use my normal commute time to do my exercise and sometimes I struggle with motivation. I could get to work earlier but the nature of the work is, I’ll still end up working late. So might as well get there later. I don’t usually exercise in the morning on a Wednesday – I have a walk at lunchtime to my dad’s flat to pick up the post. He went into hospital in March, where he caught Covid-19 and his mobility deteriorated to a point where he won’t walk again, so he’s in acare home (temporary at the moment,but no way will he be able to come home). I guess I could redirect the mail, but it’s nice to have a reason to go for a walk and I don’t have to go inside the block as the post-boxes are outside. I sometimes use the Headspace app to try sleep meditation or for sleep soundscapes. I also use sleeping pills once a week to try and get at least one night’s good sleep – but this is the same as it was before the lockdown."

My daily routine changed because normally I have a long commute to work in the car. This was an immediate change. My drive to work got replaced by a lie in. I still got up and did my exercise routine before starting work, but I started getting up later and later. I wasn’t benefiting from no commute. My days ended later and later because there was no reason not to (no long drive home and light evenings). Because I am now having to look after my father’s business (as an advocate rather than a direct carer) I have a lot of things that need doing – from forms to fill in to things he needs to be delivered to the homes/hospitals he has been in since March. I therefore asked to work compressed hours – four long days with one day off during the week. This was a way to motivate myself to get out of bed on my work days and to make the fact that I was working later benefit me (and my dad). I use my non-work day for all the admin things I am too tired to do by the time it comes to the weekend.  Before I started working compressed hours I thought it would be a good way to also control the amount of hours I was working – I was going to work nine hours, 15 minutes a day and no more. That didn’t last a week. I’ve kept working flexi-time and recording my hours. Otherwise I would be working a lot of hours for free. I know that a lot of people in my department have been working ridiculous hours and not stopping at the weekend. I am trying to discipline myself not to do that. It is difficult. I would compare opening the laptop in the morning to being sucked into a whirlwind, and it just doesn’t stop, ever. What compressed hours does do is clear one day a week for me to deal with some of the things I have to do in terms of my father’s care and planning on selling his flat to pay for that.  Working from home also enables me to take and make the calls I need to related to my father’s care. I can put my phone on speaker while waiting for social care or DWP or the hospital to answer and continue with my work. Something I could not do in the office. I cannot always take my dad’s calls – sometimes I’m on a work call or extremely busy with work. But I hear the calls come to the phone and call back when I can. Not something I could do if I was in office where my phone would be on silent. My work day now starts earlier than it would if I was in the office and ends much later. Because it can and because we are so busy. My days and weeks fly by, and often I need to look at my desk calendar to work out what day it actually is.  My non-working day is Thursday, which is market day in Devizes. Not my choice, but the most convenient day for work. I wouldn’t by choice go into town on market day (too busy and most people are quite grumpy/bad mannered on market day). However, due to the things I’ve had to do, I have often found myself in town on a Thursday. It’s not been as bad as I expected. I was pleasantly surprised that when the news came out that mask wearing in shops was going to be compulsory, a lot of people started wearing them the week before.  Since the non-essential shops have opened, I have bought a few more things locally than I ever would. I’d normally go out of town for shopping. I had to go to Swindon town centre on a dad-related task a few weeks ago and enjoyed being back there as that’s one of the places I normally shop. However I won’t be going back anytime soon, with the covid cases there. I don’t wear a watch most days – which I always used to. But sitting at my computer all day means I can see the time on the monitor. I only need a watch if I leave the house, and only then if there is some time limitation (parking). I have recently seen articles (why do I read these media outlets?) about how civil servants need to set an example by going ‘back to work’. What a great way to use civil servants as a national political punching-bag yet again. These articles make me angry. I have been working the whole time. We were ordered out of the office and we kept up the productivity. Now they want to order us back to the office to help the economy and who cares about our health? I suppose if we die that will be better too as they won’t have to pay us. Personally, I am not one for buying coffee and sandwiches at work. Maybe at Christmas or on a special occasion, that’s it. So I won’t be helping the economy in the town I work in by going back there. I can just as easily help the economy in Devizes by staying here. If I do go into town on a Thursday I very often buy my lunch there. Also, even before the pandemic, we were told that our workplace was moving towards 70% office occupancy. There were grumblings about that, but it was reaching crisis level with the car parking not coping, so that was the plan already. So if the office can’t cope with 100% occupancy and there’s no sign of the end of the pandemic and we’re managing working from home, where is the urgency to go back?  Saying that, I have been in to the office a few times. My job can be emotionally difficult and I can tell by speaking to people in my team when they are also feeling a bit frayed by what we are having to do while sitting on our own without anyone to blow off steam with. We need the social contact for our mental health. I started going in once a fortnight for this reason and letting other members of the team know that this was an option for them too, as a way for us to meet and properly be able to socialise together (in a socially distant way). I can tell that people’s social skills are being eroded, including mine. I’ve seen emails that are blunter than they should be (and in some cases outright rude and unacceptable). This is because we are on our own and have no one to bounce things off before we hit send. We are also all dealing with different home pressures. We run the risk of all becoming isolated and acting more like internet trolls. We need that balance of other people to vent our frustrations to before composing the socially acceptable version of the ‘why the hell are you doing that?’ type of email. Without regular face to face interaction I feel like we are going a little off course. We need at least occasional interaction to keep us on the right track. There is a certain amount of what I call ‘covid blindness’ in the department. An expectation that things will get done as normal. When someone senior questions why something wasn’t done in March this year and states that we must do better, it is legitimate to wonder what planet they are living on. Homelife As I said above, I’ve been working from home the whole time. But with work colleagues we still talk in terms of ‘going to work’ and ‘going home’ sometimes. Because we haven’t yet got the language down for working from home.  I get up and start work at regular times. I’m not so good about finishing work. If my husband goes to the pub after work I just stay at work (there’s always plenty to do) until he gets home. Now that he’s going to work, I have the house to myself, just me and the cat, during the day.  I think that in future, it’s likely that I’ll be going in to the office two days a week, but it’s all up in the air at the moment. I think two days would be about right for me, and I want to keep doing compressed hours so that I have one day to do dad-admin.  My cat supervises my work. He comes and sits on the desk or me every day. This is both soothing (when I’ve got difficult things to deal with) and annoying (when he gets between me and the keyboard) but overall I’d say he’s a very positive influence on my mood. I don’t feel completely alone. I am a little worried about him and how attached he’s getting, so we’re getting kittens soon. I’m hoping they aren’t too much trouble for our old boy but I can be here to supervise the introductions and interactions for a while.  I set up my workspace in the spare bedroom. I now have a breakfast bar for a desk which I can sit at (on a bar stool) or stand at, so it’s a standing desk (sort of). We were able to have our desk technology (keyboard/monitor etc) at home, which I did to start with. Then I bought my own, in white rather than work-black. So the only work-owned thing I use is my laptop. This was an effort to reclaim my space and pretend that the desk is for my own use, not primarily a workspace.  It hasn’t worked. I used to use the spare room for my hobby room and gym. I still have my gym here, but it’s not the sanctuary it was. How can it be, with my desk in here? And it’s the last place I want to be on the weekend when I’ve spent my whole work-week here. Right now I’m at my desk, using my home laptop, but sitting here it feels like a work-day, because that’s what it is the majority of the time I’m sat here. Media and technology Before lockdown we were all issued with headsets, but we didn’t use them really, we continued to use our desk phones. Of course, all that changed when we all started working from home. Using Skype for phone in meetings and calls is so useful. I’ve been on a call to one person and invited someone else to join (very useful). And in big meetings I like that it shows who is talking (I’m terrible at names and can’t recognise voices very well). I actually prefer attending large meetings (where I may not have much of a role) this way. I can listen but also do other things. I can take actions while in the meeting – taking notes for sending out to others on the computer rather than in a note book, or if someone in the meeting asks for something, I can send it to them right away.  I was already tagging people for status changes in Skype to see when they were back at their desk, now that’s how I call them too. I also like that I can see who is calling before I answer – I always do answer but it’s a heads-up to what the call is likely to be about. We’re not having social get-togethers with work on zoom anymore. To me the lockdown reminds me of starting college. All dealing with a new location and a new context and wanting to be together all the time in the new environment. Then people settle down and get on with it.  Home-wise, we’ve continued the pub-zoom meeting on a Sunday – although there has been some controversy on the whatsapp group recently. Some of the bar workers are on the zoom and whatsapp group and one was questioning why more of us were not returning to the pub. That turned into a ‘discussion’ between two people – one saying we should go back (to help the pub) and one saying (very politely) that due to health concerns they didn’t feel comfortable yet. The person who was pushing for a return to the pub called the health concerns ‘an excuse’ which set me off. My response was:  While I understand the need to support the economy, I also know that health concerns must be top priority. And I don’t need to have gone through the worry of my dad catching covid whilst in isolation in a hospital to feel that way. That stopped the conversation but it had already upset me. I’ve had a lot to deal with this year and I don’t need this kind of rubbish. Waiting The queues outside shops have eased now that non-essential shops are open. While they were in existence, I found acceptance the easiest way to deal with it. If I was going to Boots, I knew there would be a queue so I made sure I had a book on my phone to read. No point getting annoyed, we all had to do it. One of the worst parts was waiting for my holiday (a cruise) to be cancelled. We knew it was going to happen, but the company took ages to confirm, then ages to pay our money back. We’re not booking anything now, no point while things are still uncertain. I feel like I’ve been in hibernation for ages, not wearing my nice work clothes, makeup or contact lenses or going out clothes. I am sick of my sports tops (which are non-iron) which I have been wearing all the time and are now my lockdown uniform. I did buy a new work suit and wore it to work on one of my days in the office. We don’t have a dress code but I like wearing smart clothes. Just no point at the moment. All of my going out clothes haven’t been touched. I do have a wedding coming up, so I am looking forward to dressing up for that! My dad has been waiting for somewhere permanent to live following being in hospital and catching covid there. He couldn’t go home as he’s lost the use of his legs. He was moved to one care home, then another after being pushed out of hospital. All he wanted was to be back in Devizes, but he needed a nursing home. Now he’s got a place in Devizes but he’s been hospitalised again with an infection and feels like he’s gone back to square one on this horrible game. I was so upset that we’d finally got him back home and a permanent place to live and he had to go back to the hospital where this all started in March. He’s now waiting for an MRI scan (the machine has broken down) and they won’t let him out until he’s had it. I tell him it’s not the same as last time as he now has a home to go to, but it is so disheartening. Every day he’s in hospital he’s getting less mobile."

Probably someone who exercises regularly, with good lung function and no health issues.  Someone who carries no excess fat, but neither are they underweight. They don’t smoke and they drink moderately if at all. They eat a healthy diet, low in meat. high in fruit and vegetables. They get enough sleep. I can’t think of any specific ways that my gender, ethnicity, social class or sexual orientation has affected my general health.  Maybe my working class 1950s upbringing had some influence – getting on with hard work, eating mostly non-processed food in those days – these early experiences have lived with me and continue, so that I do get a fair amount of exercise and I eat a pretty healthy diet. Aren’t we all somehow at least vaguely aware of ‘health’ most of our lives?  My maternal grandmother died when my mother was just 6, which had a profound effect on my mother’s life, so I was always aware of that and of how my mother hated hospitals.  My father had had a serious accident when he was 14 which resulted in him losing several toes and spending months in hospital, so again, I was aware of that.  But everyday health was not something talked about, other than the usual occasional common illnesses that occurred.  At secondary school we were given talks about not smoking, as it was bad for our health.  My first job was working in the offices of the local health department, so I was constantly aware of it then. The notion of ‘wellbeing’ is much more recent I think. When I was still teaching, my head teacher took staff wellbeing seriously and undertook several initiatives in that area – this is probably when I first became aware of it.  She made sure that our staff room was a pleasant place to be, nicely furnished and light. She provided coffee and tea free of charge.  But it became obvious to me that not everyone has the same ideas about what wellbeing is. She engaged a lady to give massages during the lunch break, each of us able to have one a month.  For most of the staff, this was very much welcomed, but I am not a fan of massages – I did try it but it had only a negative effect and because it was during the lunch hour, it wasn’t ideal to then have to go straight back to the classroom.  I somewhat jokingly suggested that my own well being would be served very well if the head would take my class for half an hour occasionally, giving me an extra half hour at lunchtime, but of course it never happened. I can’t remember when I first learned about puberty – it was a long time ago!  Probably through talking with friends, most of whom started their periods before me.  My mother never mentioned them so it was difficult when I did start to tell her.  She then just dealt with it matter of factly and gave me sanitary towels and an elastic belt to hook them on to. It was all very embarrassing. Nowadays things are discussed much more openly which can only be a good thing. As I mentioned earlier, I have always kept reasonably physically active and eat a pretty healthy diet.  I have never smoked and drink moderately.  I am increasingly aware of looking after myself as I get older – anything that will help stave off the inevitable. I take Vitamin D. As I have a thyroid problem I take tablets for that. I’ve never had problems with my mental state particularly, and maybe that’s due to keeping active – even when I’m watching TV I like to have some sewing or knitting or internet browsing to do.  I avoid watching too much news as I find it depressing. I do tend to avoid things that I know will upset me when I can. The only place I seek information about health is online, mostly the NHS website, if I or my husband has any symptoms. I suppose that external appearance to some extent is a reflection of health – I’m thinking predominantly of the large number of overweight people one sees these days.  I doubt you can detect a person’s wellbeing from their physical appearance.  Appearances can be deceptive. I’ve never been especially influenced by popular ideals of beauty etc, other than being overweight, but that has more to do with the potential health issues. I don’t buy beauty products other than shampoo and face cream, I rarely wear make-up. I do admit, however, to not liking my hair to look a mess! My mum liked her make-up, basic though it was. My dad wasn’t at all interested like most men of his generation and class I think. What couldn’t I live without? Just shampoo, conditioner and a basic face cream, as mentioned above. How funny to think of a desert island product! Well, being equally flippant, if there were coconuts I guess I could figure out how to make a face cream/body lotion, but I’d struggle to make shampoo, so I guess it would have to be that! All I can recall about my parents getting ready to go out for the evening is getting washed (latterly showered) and changed, my mum putting on her make-up and always perfume.  As for me, when I was still working I would shower each morning and wash my hair, sometimes apply a bit of basic make-up. That’s it.  It’s pretty much the same now when going out socially, though I rarely bother with the make-up, despite knowing it would probably make me look better. I’d put on some perfume probably.  My husband has no sense of smell, so it’s lost on him!"

As for emotions, I’ve felt sad that I can’t hug my daughter when she comes round with shopping for us. I’m extremely aware that we are lucky in having a large garden with lots of work to do in it which is good for our health. I have felt anxious about where it’s all going to lead and leave us – all of us. The Government I think the government has done too little too late throughout the pandemic. They made the decision not to buy PEP three times early on which is inexcusable and continue to be too easy going about it all I feel. What will they do in the coming months? Who knows. Make the wrong decisions probably, relaxing restrictions too soon, trying to blame others when things go wrong. I look at leaders such as the New Zealand prime minister and Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland and wish our leader was more like them. News My husband and I have totally different attitudes towards the news. I look at the BBC news website every morning to get the headlines and that’s enough for me. He watches every news – mid-day, 6pm, 10pm and then Newsnight (by which time I’ve gone to bed). I don’t think it helps to immerse yourself in it – it certainly wouldn’t help me, though he finds it vital. We haven’t watched the daily government briefings at all. I wonder how many people do? So much of what is in the TV news (which I watch the headlines of then go into another room while my husband watches the rest) seem to focus on what ifs and complaints against the authorities/government. I don’t see the point of that. Just deal with it and move forward. I don’t know anyone having problems with access. The Scottish parliament using BSL seems a good idea, though I know it’s possible to have subtitles on TV and I imagine people do use that. Work and home life As we are retired the lockdown has had far less impact on us than many others, and I suspect that people in our position will be the least affected. Our life has changed only in that we haven’t been shopping, but the main affect is that we would have been over at our house in France since March which of course hasn’t been possible. As we’re used to spending all our time together everything has been fine. Technology It would have been much more difficult to cope with the lockdown without the internet that’s for sure. A friend in the village set up a Zoom group early on for several of us to chat each morning at 11am with a coffee. This continues, mostly just with us and her and her husband, occasionally some of the other 4 couples join in. It’s been good having this contact, even though we all live within a few hundred yards of each other. I regularly Whats App with my daughter and have kept in touch a little more than usual via that and email with family in Cumbria. I’ve also emailed friends nearby and further afield a little more frequently than usual. I’m not a lover of the phone so rarely use that. I do use Facebook and Twitter but no more than usual – though this is several times a day. It feels good to be in touch with friends around the world, know they’re OK and share memories as well as current statuses. A friend who lives in Derbyshire invited us with another couple to a Zoom dinner party that was good fun. We chatted, had a break to eat, then came back together after each course. He had sent us a couple of quiz rounds to look at while we ate then we shared answers. It was also good to interact with new people – something that of course isn’t happening now. Shopping and food Prior to lockdown I had gradually stocked the pantry pretty well, including the things we would have been taking with us had we been able to go to France, so we were OK for some things from the start. We have been fortunate that we had just started to get Hello Fresh deliveries which provides the ingredients for three fresh meals each week that I cook. This has been fun – I don’t have to plan the meals and I’m learning new recipes. It works out at £5 per head per meal. The other good things are that because the local market has been closed, some of the market traders have been delivering, so we have had weekly deliveries of fruit and veg, milk, eggs, bread and butter; meat and fish (we alternate those). For other things my daughter has shopped for us once every 7-10 days which she brings over and we can chat in the garden at the appropriate distance of course! So we haven’t missed out on anything. Oh, and I’ve also bartered rhubarb from the garden for eggs from a friend up the road – we hang our respective bags on the gatepost for exchange when she passes. As things reopen gradually (the markets start next week) we plan to do click and collect from Sainsbury’s to avoid going into the shops. We haven’t been near any sort of shop for the past nine weeks. An interesting and unexpected bonus came via a friend in the village. Through contacts she gets a delivery each week from Waitrose of their unsold short shelf-life products (fruit and veg and sometimes bread). We pick up some of that from her driveway and help bag the rest for delivery to vulnerable people in the village. What’s left then goes to Mildenhall up the road for distribution to families there. For non-grocery items I have ordered a couple of thing s online which is not something I would normally do. I ordered seeds for the garden and a kettle when the old one broke! Oh, and I’ve just sent for some summer clothes as all mine are in France! That’s definitely a first! Entertainment and Leisure Because the weather has been mostly in our favour and we have a large garden that has been neglected for several years with us being in France most of the summer, we have spent a lot of time working outside. This has felt good on two counts – (a) to be outside and productively occupied and (b) because the garden is looking much better than it has for years. We’ve cleared several large overgrown areas and replanted them and have had the opportunity to consider plans for larger scale, longer-term projects like erecting fencing and a wooden garage. A couple of friends kindly donated plants they were clearing and we were able to get some delivered from a market garden in the village. There’s still plenty to do and we have a veg plot that’s coming on well. We have potatoes, onions, spinach, runner and French beans, carrots, leeks, tomatoes and courgettes. I had bought the seeds prior to lockdown and we got tomato plants from a stall in the village. We also have apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, strawberries and quinces coming on, though the birds always get to the cherries before we do. I enjoy genealogy and have spent some time doing that, for others as well as myself. Like many others, I’ve cleared out cupboards and drawers and got rid of things no longer needed. I put a box of books outside the gate for people to help themselves to, replenishing it as they were taken. That felt good. My husband is missing his trips to the gym so has been running three times a week, either a 3 or 5 or on two occasions an 8 mile route. We walk the dog twice a day on our friend’s field opposite the house with occasional longer walks round the village. TV watching hasn’t changed. Lunch while watching Bargain Hunt which is a nice distraction. N then watches the news. In the evening I enjoy quizzes such as Mastermind, Only Connect and Pointless, and cooking programmes like The Greta British Menu and Masterchef but most of those have finished now. I enjoy the Great British Sewing Bee. We watch Poirot (all of which we’ve seen before). There’s nothing much worth while watching really. We’ve watched a couple of DVDs. As I said earlier, N. watches a lot of news which I leave him to and he often goes to listen to music in his study while I watch my programmes. It’s not a bad thing to be able to spend some time apart in this situation. For example, I am writing this sitting in my garden beach hut while N. is writing poems in his study. We know that we are very fortunate to have this space and I am very aware that for many people lockdown must be extremely difficult because of where they live. We both read, me mostly when I go to bed. I’ve just finished Gerald Durrell’s Corfu Trilogy having enjoyed watching The Durrells on TV. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have a book here in the beach hut – The Trials of the King of Hampshire (non-fiction historical) and there’s a biography of Mrs. Beeton on the kitchen table rather appropriately! which I sometimes dip into while eating. N. has started having the Saturday Guardian delivered which keeps him happy for most of the week. I haven’t listened to much radio, though I occasionally have it on while I’m cooking. Radio 4. I used to have Today on in the morning but it’s too much these days. I like the comedy programmes such as I’m Sorry I haven’t a clue or The Unbelievable Truth. There’s sometimes a good play or documentary. Personal hygiene We’ve certainly been doing the hand-washing that’s recommended, even though we aren’t going out. We always wash our hands when touching anything that’s come into the house – mail, deliveries etc. And I use an anti-bac wipe on the gate handle when people come through. Like just about everyone, our hair has grown! I always’ cut N’s so he’s all right but mine is usually quite short. I’ve had a go at trimming it myself a bit which seems OK, but I’ve just been styling it differently and it’s fine. Sleep There’s been no change in our sleep patterns at all. Though this is an interesting question for us as my husband has a sleep disorder which means we are used to disturbed nights. He has something called REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder which basically means that he enacts his dreams, which are usually quite active, e.g. running away from animals, fighting off assailants or wasps. This inevitably wakes me up, and we have had to make adjustments to our bedroom to accommodate it, e.g. a very low bed, foam pieces around his side of the bed, as he has thrown himself out several times in the past, causing quite severe injury. He has medication that has helped a bit. Other than that, it’s been perfectly normal!"

With the health of the nation coming under closer scrutiny during the Covid-19 pandemic I have felt more aware of my own physical health but am not overly worried to the point of putting myself on a diet or taking up strenuous exercise. However, my mental health has definitely changed, not for the better, mainly due to an almost constant diet of ‘worst case scenarios‘ pushed on us by the media! At 65, I am not doing too badly. I can manage most everyday tasks with no problem, other than age-related wear of joints and muscles. I try to eat a varied diet but there is always room for improvement. During the pandemic it has been very obvious that there has been quite a lot of ‘comfort’ eating and drinking – at the lowest points, when media outlets carried wall-to-wall pessimism about the virus, it was easy to slip into an attitude of ‘eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die’ mentality! Growing up hearing about health and wellbeing Growing up in post-War Britain, we were told to eat what was in front of us, there was no time for ‘fads’, you ate what you were given or went without. However, for all we were in the low-income bracket, we never went to bed hungry. There may have been a little more stodge to fill out the meals, but we generally had a good range of vegetables and fruit (home grown out of economic necessity and a hang-over from the ‘dig for victory’ habits of the war years). Exercise came naturally – we walked every where and kids played out and about or used bicycles. That said, I never took part in extra-curricular organised sports – I was more of a bookworm. Key Moments Puberty arrived, a few talks from the District Nurse at school and a much-relieved Mother who audibly sighed when she sat me down to talk about the facts of life and realised she didn’t have to engage with things that were generally not talked about! I had an older sister, so I had someone else to talk to about practicalities. My mother was quite reserved about personal things and although we did get on well, she had a debilitating illness (MS) which was diagnosed when I was four years old, so I basically never had what some might call a close maternal relationship. She died when I was 18. I faced all the usual feminine milestones mainly with the help of magazines and playground conversations. I found this lack of maternal connection affected my own issues with having children of my own – what was normal and what to expect.  My sister lived in another part of the country and we were not really close in relationship, so I had no-one to talk to, other than friends going through a similar stage of life. Growing older Again, when the menopause appeared on the horizon, I had no familial experiences by which to judge what was expected or normal, but at least I now had access to the internet by which to educate myself. I also booked an appointment with the Community Nurse at the Doctor’s Surgery to get advice, which was helpful – but during the course of this she discovered I had high blood pressure so menopause concerns went out of the window as she dealt with that less appealing stage of age and bodily decline! More recently I have developed an auto-immune condition which has required further tablets and blood tests and an acceptance that some activities are now off limits. Age-related vision problems then reared their ugly head, so anno domini is certainly making its presence felt! However, all in all, I am not too bad and I keep soldiering on, ever mindful that I can no longer accomplish what I used to do! Health, wellbeing and appearance Since I retired I have been able to dress to suit my mood or whatever I’ve been doing, rather than having to be smart for work. In the lockdown restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been very liberating to only have to ‘dress up’ when leaving the house! That said, I have never spent days in pyjamas, unlike many I’ve spoken to on the subject. I always get up and wash/shower and change into day clothes, even if it’s only joggers and a comfortable warm jumper – I wouldn’t be seen dead walking down the garden to the dustbin in my PJs! Again, with the restrictions imposed by lockdowns and a lack of visits to the hairdresser, I’ve never succumbed to trying to cut my own hair (or my husband’s!) Wearing a hat in the cold weather was a useful alternative, but I do think if things progress I may have to wear a hairband to keep things under the semblance of control! When I was still going out to work I would not leave the house with at least mascara and a dash of eye shadow, but since I’ve had cataract trouble (as well as a torn retina) I found I couldn’t see so well to apply make-up and as time has worn on I have got out of the habit. Perhaps I’m no longer bothered about keeping up appearances! Getting ready to leave the house In my Parents’ day, you always left the house appropriately dressed – I am no different. I remember my father, who worked the night shift in a factory, getting ready for work. He would prepare his packed ‘lunch’ (he called it his ‘bait’!) or my sister or myself would do it. Then he’d get his coat or jacket and one of us children would be sent to look out of the front room window to watch out for one of his work mates to arrive by car to give him a lift to the factory. I remember it was always about the same time as the BBC radio programme “The Archers” was on, as the theme tune was almost the soundtrack to Dad setting off for work. Even if I happen to hear it nowadays, it conjures up Dad setting off along the path to the waiting car. As a child there was always someone at home, either my mother or Grandmother, so I never had the need of a door key and never returned to an empty house. Nowadays, of course, I need to pick up car keys, handbag, hand sanitizer and masks! As long as I’m ‘presentable’ I don’t tend to bother too much – besides, in the Winter months a decent coat covers a multitude of sins!"

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. • Resilience (to minor infections) • Stamina • Vitality • Strength • Wellness Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. There are a handful of people who come to mind. Some are much younger than me but others are a similar age.  Those of a similar age enjoy yoga, running, walking, swimming, cooking for themselves wherever possible and eating well.  They also take (sometimes forced) time to look after their mental health. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Yes I do. I was lucky to have been raised by parents who believed in a healthy, balanced diet which included plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.  They also encouraged us to walk every day, swim once a week and emphasised the importance of getting outside whenever possible and in all types of weather (as long as we were dressed appropriately.  I am pretty sure my Dad believed in the saying ‘There's no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing’). I always thought that was a Norwegian quote but I am not so sure now. I still walk every day, in all kinds of weather.  In fact, I prefer to walk when it is colder than during the very hot, humid months of Summer. I particularly love Autumn and Spring; they are my two favourite seasons. I adore the colours in late September, October and November and I also enjoy Springtime with all of the flowers coming back to life. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I first became aware of health when I was a teenager.  The term ‘Wellbeing’ came much later. I think the increased awareness surrounding mental wellbeing has been something that was much needed and very welcomed.  I do hope that the focus on wellbeing around mental health is increased within schools and I believe it should also include information on the benefits of good quality sleep and how lack of sleep can affect immunity.  Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My parents.  Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? I do not specifically remember my parents talking to me about health. I have two sisters and one of them was very ill with renal failure. I would have been about eight years old when she was first diagnosed.  She was six.  A lot of the conversations that we, as a family had were about my sister’s health.  Sadly, she spent a large amount of time in hospital, both in Suffolk (my childhood home) and in London, where she was able to receive more specific treatment.  She underwent a kidney transplant at the age of 14 and is now 49. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? To be honest, health education in school in the 1970s and 1980s was lacking somewhat.  The internet was not around so I read a lot of magazines and talked to friends. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? I think first period and buying your first bra are very important. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? In all honesty, I did not really give them too much thought.  It was very much a case of ‘Get on with it’ which I know now is not very helpful to a teenager (or anyone at any age!) but when I was growing up, it really was like that.  It was almost as if feeling slightly sorry for oneself was seen as a weakness and an indulgence.  Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I walk for a few miles every day.  I also practise Pilates on a daily basis.  I used to swim quite a bit as well and I do plan to take this up again.  W7312 My information regarding health and wellbeing comes mainly from professionals on social media.  I am far more aware of my body now, at the age of 51, than I was thirty years ago. In future years I intend to remain as physically active as possible.  I have had a handful of health ‘scares’ over the past ten years and was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis in both feet last year.  Unfortunately, this meant an operation within three months of diagnosis in order to try and release the joint in my left foot.  I am absolutely determined to carry on walking as much as I can as walking is so important to my overall health and wellbeing.  Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I take multivitamins and have been using a Vitamin D spray for around four years.  I am not sure what level of protection the multivitamins give but I definitely could not be without the Vitamin D spray. In respect of beauty products, I would take moisturiser and lots of it!  My skin is particularly sensitive and I have experienced Psoriasis in the past and currently have episodes of Eczema.  I have to use a lot of moisturising cream every day so that would be one thing that I could not be without.  To be honest, I love beauty products!  I follow a handful of make-up artists on Instagram (Lisa Eldridge being my favourite) and I find it quite therapeutic to watch a tutorial every now and again. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My parents would occasionally attend dances where they would dress up. I do not really remember them getting ready but looking back at photographs I can see that they did look rather glamorous!  My routine for work includes applying make-up and straightening my hair.  I have never followed clothing fashion and tend to buy something that I like rather than if it is ‘In Vogue’.  I tend to seek out bargains and I do enjoy a good sale.  My clothes that I have not worn for a while go straight to charity.  I also do the same with both my daughters’ clothes.  A couple of years ago I gave quite a few old coats away to a charity that had sent out a plea.  When I visited the charity, I hung the coats on a rack and it struck me how utterly sad it was that a child would have to be without a coat in the depth of Winter."

Part 2 MO number P7590. Female. 72. Married but living apart. Kendal Cumbria. Retired. Everyday Health and Well Being. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body; Health is very important to me. Any part of it can be taken away from you at a moments notice. It needs to be nurtured and cherished and not taken for granted. It requires daily maintenance just to keep things ticking along smoothly. Wellbeing. The mind needs daily care too. A positive attitude to life whatever is thrown your way. A cheerful disposition to everyone around you helps them to see you care. A joy in waking up each day and the anticipation of what the days experiences will be you and at the end of the day cherishing those memories. A healthy body. Weight, teeth, skin, posture, fitness. No particular person comes to mind. Identity. I do think my experience of health has been influenced by gender and  social class by wanting to fit in with those around me who are the same. Ethnicity or sexual orientation has not had any influence on how I feel about my identity. Growing up and learning about health and well being. I first became aware of health at nursery school aged 4. We were given a daily spoon full of Cod Live Oil and fresh concentrated orange juice. We were told it was to keep us healthy. We were still experiencing rationing at that time. My parents and extended family encouraged me to be out in the open as much as possible and to socialise with other children and adult family members. I believe it was to give me confidence in life’s experiences and to teach me to look after myself. I am very grateful for the opportunities I was given as a child to go and explore the geography and history of the surrounding area where I lived. I was able to see first hand the massive changes to the area of Smethwick West Midlands undergoing mass slum clearance. The old courts swept away to be supplanted by high rise flats.. The decline of the canal system and the slowly changes from steam powered trains to diesel locomotives. The difference the clean air policy introduced to clear away the frequent smog’s caused by factory and coal fire emissions. At those times you could taste the sulphur when you walked in the fog. My parents and school took responsibility for looking after my health and wellbeing. At primary school we were given a chart with a list of things we should doo each day and to tick the days we achieved each one. i.e. Brushing our teeth or sleeping with the window open etc. It encouraged me to be very honest and I felt quite guilty if I had to put a cross in any of the boxes. My whole school life had at various stages talks and films on health and wellbeing  suitable for our age group at the time. My mother also talked about periods and how you got pregnant when I was quite young. Possibly because I had a brother 6 years older than me. She told us together. Key moments I was thirteen when I fist noticed my boobs getting bigger and 14 when I had my first period. P7590 It was important to me at the time that my first bra was the same as my peers and that I had the same stockings. I wept buckets if my mum bought the wrong stockings and I was teased about it. She thought buying e thick ones for the winter would keep me warmer. I was terrified when my mother suggested I should shave under my arm pits. She did it for time the first time. Growing older I have always been active in some forms of sport. At school it was the gym or cross country running I liked the most. Once I had learnt to swim I went every week if I could. I also had a bike and would cycle everyday. I walked to and from school and home every day. Going home for lunch in my final year. I continued to cycle and swim until I had a series of operations which now prevents those activities. I walk most days now for exercise. Living in the Lake district I have been fell walking for the last 25 years. I don’t really look for articles on health and wellbeing. I do follow healthy eating recipes in the cookery books written by Doctor/food advisor Dale Pinnock. He gives explanations as to what food groups are good for what parts of the body and why. His recipes are quick and easy and small portions size. I am more aware of my limitations now I am getting older. I am not able to do as much as a few years ago. My body is wearing out. I don’t expect my approach to health and well being to change. I shall continue to stretch my body to its maximum potential. Also, to continue on my current eating habits with the exception of alcohol intake which needs to be reduced a bit. Health, well being and appearance I have always felt that to make that extra effort with appearance makes a person feel better. Even washing your face and brushing teeth every day has an uplifting affect. During the lock down times I have made the effort to still wear perfume and occasionally put on a nice skirt and top instead of slumming around in jogging pants. When you’re not going anywhere it is easy to slip into doing nothing but watch tv all day and lounge on the couch. I have not done this and found something positive to do every day so I don’t get bored and feel sorry for myself. With regard to being influenced by popular ideals of beauty, I suppose I have been to a degree. Seeing clothes modelled in magazines or on a pc web page influences your choice as to whether you want to buy a particular garment. Of course, you never look quite the same as the picture but you can in your own way feel comfortable with the choice. I have continued to shave my legs, wax lip and chin and whiten my teeth even though I am haven’t been going anywhere. My mother always made the effort to look properly dressed when going out. Wearing a hat and gloves in the1950’s and 60’s. These were dropped in later years as they became less fashionable. She coloured her hair and waxed her top lip as we all do up to a certain age. My father always wore a collar and tie or cravat with leisure wear. There is one product I can’t live without and would need on a desert island. Sun cream. I spend a lot of time out of doors and have fair skin and once had red hair. I were it on my face every day under a face cream as I can get sunburnt in minutes. I remember my mother getting ready to go to a dance. She had a very curved back and would get me to roll her back with a rolling pin while she laid face down on the floor. I don’t think it ever worked much. She was very self-conscious of her back . It was prevalent in her family and I have it to a lesser degree too. My father would always shave and shower or bath before going out anywhere. If to a dance with my mother he would wear dinner suit or sometimes tails if it was a really highbrow affair. My routine is similar. Shower first and maybe wash and style my hair. Wear something smart and add perfume. I used to always wear face makeup but now I just colour my eyebrows and P7590 occasionally a bit of lipstick. Yes my routine has changed over time. I don’t go out to dinner dances anymore. In normal times I would just go out for a meal or visit friends or social gatherings at one of the many clubs I have joined. These have ceased for the time being. I have not been out for a meal since February 2020. I have however visited a few friends in their homes when that has been allowed."

The ambulance arrived immediately as it was very quiet with no-one calling. The A&E at the hospital was similarly empty but fully staffed and I was seen quickly and was able to go home after a couple of hours. All the time I was at hospital there were only 2 other patients in the A&E department. Because my husband was not allowed to accompany me due to the Covid restrictions I had to call my daughter to come and collect me and take me home. Seemed a bit odd! Apart from that I have not had any physical issues at all during lockdown. Neither has my husband. Mentally I have been okay although there are days when I feel low but this passes quite quickly and I walk through the local fields with our dog which is a great boost to my spirits.Emotionally I have been fine. I miss my children and grandchildren but its something we have to do - so I just get on with it.The government - I think the government has done a good job regarding the decisions made. It is very easy for the press and the other political parties to be wise after the event. No-one could have foreseen this and the government is helping people as much as practically possible.As a country we have to get back to work. I believe that over the coming weeks and months restrictions will be gradually lifted. I believe that if the cases of the virus goes up then restrictions will be imposed again.News - I listen to the news once a day; but only a short 3 minute bulletin. Listening to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme is the most depressing thing as it is so biased and so depressing.I do listen to the daily Government Broadcasts at 5pm. I call it 'misery hour.' I think the daily government minister and experts are good. The questions from the general public are good. The questions from the press are hostile and repetitive. It's like they don't listen to each other. The same question is asked by every different reporter. The women reporters are usually more hostile than the men. They don't see understand how much this type of interrogations put people off.I have not experienced any challenges when accessing the news. As said I only watch the 5pm broadcast and listen to one other bulleting. I did not know about a petition regarding BSL. I wear hearing aids myself and I put on sub-titles if I find I cannot hear a programme.2Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland is a law unto herself. No doubt she has a BSL interpreter to ensue she scores a point with the politically correct brigade.Work and home life - I am retired so working from home/furloughed does not apply. There are just the 2 of us in our home and we have been fineTechnology- I was already familiar with Syke, Facetime and Whatsapp and have used these to keep in contact with children/grandchildren. I am a member of several social groups and have enjoyed zoom meetings. Zoom was a new experience and is very good except that everyone has a tendency to talk over each other. It is nice to catch up though. I've not found it stressful or a challenge as I like to think I am quite savvy when it comes to technology.I am a member of Facebook and use it primarily to keep in touch with a cousin in Nebraska USA and my WI group but otherwise try to use it as little as possible. I find it incredible that people are taken in by the absolute rubbish and vitriol which is posted on it by people who are quite pleasant if you meet them in real life. If you dare to post a different point of view then the dislike and hate which comes your way is palatable. If you rely on Facebook for any true news then you are quite likely to be disappointed. Because of the evils of Facebook I don't touch any other social media platforms.Shopping and food - . My husband has asthma so I have done all the shopping. This was a challenge at first. I had not used my online shopping account with Sainsburys for a while and found I was locked out of my account and completely unable to contact their helpline. was able to use Iceland Home delivery service and they were great. In order to avoid going to a supermarket more than once a fortnight I found that Abel and Cole were offering a non­ organic veg box which I have delivered weekly. Apart from going to a local store for milk and bread I am able to avoid the larger shops for the most part. From my experience in shopping in person I think the smaller shops are doing much better on the social distancing than the larger ones. You may have to queue at 2 metre intervals at the checkouts and in the queue to get inside but once you are in the shop then its impossible to keep the correct distance with in-store shoppers who just walk up close to you to get to the shelves, totally ignoring the in-store customers who are trying to play by the rules. In the smaller co-ops for example, where they operate a one-out, one-in system I feel much safer.Entertainment and leisure - I promised myself this year that I would not race about too much and have more time for myself-you should be careful what you wish for! I have rediscovered my love for jigsaws and have completed 3 hard ones so far. I enjoy alternate days walking the dog and have discovered some lovely walks right on my doorstep. Usually I drive to a local park and walk but its too crowded with joggers and cyclists at the moment so I am avoiding it. My husband walks our dog on the days I don't. On my non dog-walking days I walk locally for at least 40 minutes. I enjoy listening to Scala Radio and Magic Radio3and I try not to start watching TV until at least 4pm. Sometimes in the evening we will play games such as Scrabble or Mexican Train. I read a lot. I potter in the garden. I don't do any DIY. Housework is not something I enjoy, ever, and continue to do it as I normally do - when it needs doing. I have felt no compunction to start cleaning out cupboards! I have 6 grandchildren ranging from 3 to 17. I keep in touch with the older 2 (12 and 17) via Facetime but the other ones - 3, 5, 6 and 7 I have started to write to. Short letters and cards once a week which they really seem to enjoy getting. Hats off to the Royal Mail for keeping the mail deliveries going. It's beginning to be a struggle to think of things to say in my letters but I am managing to find various puzzles and photos to send. All in all I am surprised at how quickly the time has passed although I am getting a bit bored at times.Personal hygiene - My daily habits have remained the same. I set the alarm for 7am and I shower every morning. Normally I put on make up every day but I don't bother all the time at the moment. I always wear makeup to the shops or even to post a letter.Sleep - Funnily enough I have slept better over the past few weeks than I have other the past few years! I am aware that we are fortunate in that we don't have a job to worry about or an income in jeopardy. I worry for our children but manage to keep busy enough during the day to ensure a good nights sleep. My dreams, as far as I can remember have remained untroubles."

I suppose physically a healthy body is a body that appears to be well nourished, clean well-toned and supple. This of course is an ideal and that shape and concept changes with age and disability. I always imagine top sports men/women to have healthy bodies as they have the correct nutritional advice and exercise routines that others may not have access to. Poverty may not allow us to eat as well as we could but education can help there. Obesity to me is a dread and I find it really unattractive. Some people aspire to look different or to look like celebrities, achieving this by plastic surgery Botox and or fillers. We have all noticed when this has gone wrong, the sight of hideous over blown lips are certainly not attractive. I suppose the ideal for me would be to be well toned, with no excess weight, good teeth and a great posture., and of course healthy. This though is just the outer shell of a person not the real self.  But this is always the first thing anyone notices. Growing up in the early 60’s the emphasis was that that girls were clean and tidy and on becoming a teenager needing to impress boys. We were influenced by Peer pressure, TV adverts, TV programmes magazines and songs etc., As I have grown older I look back on some of the songs that I used to listen to and love and hear the lyrics with a different mindset and am frankly horrified how some of them help shape the identity and behaviour of women. One example being ‘Sons and Lovers’ A verse went: This is an example of a clear message to women to look the part for men. I guess there are many more songs like that that give messages on how we should look or behave. Some of H1776 the songs from Grease show very clearly the way each that gender views the other. Just listen to the lyrics of Summer Nights! In the 50’s and 60’s there really wasn’t much taught around health and certainly not well­being. We had the usual visits from the ‘nit nurse’ in primary school. One good thing though was that we all had a bottle of milk a day and all had school dinners. No packed lunches. In our school we would sit 8 to a table and be served by older pupils, the teachers all sat in the dining hall too. It was a good way to eat and socialise. I still put all our meals into serving bowls when the family come and the grandchildren love this way of eating. We had very cursory sex education delivered in such a way that was excruciating for everyone. I went to an all-girls school so didn’t get to mix with the opposite sex much. I can remember being hugely embarrassed at having to shower with others at PE. I was in the fourth year at secondary school when we were taken to the new sports field that had showers. Oh, the agony of this. I was a skinny underdeveloped teenager and felt so inadequate next to some of the girls. They constantly gave the excuse of having a period so couldn’t shower. I didn’t have that excuse until I was 16! I still have the scar on my leg from my first attempt at shaving them. I pinched my brothers razor and made a real mess of it. I have never really been overweight until about 45 years old, and then I piled on the pounds. This has never really been resolved. This initially was down to an underactive thyroid and I put on 3 stone in about as many months. I lost some of it after medical intervention but I have never got truly back to my ideal weight. Even at the age of 70 I am conscious of weight and wear a towel right to the edge of the sea before going in, there are so many beautiful people around that I feel I stand out like a sore thumb. This is where the physical imperfections show and seem to matter. I have had two hip replacements and a shoulder replacement due to arthritis. I have scars that cannot be hidden and I am aware of them. I wish I didn’t have them. I have wrinkles and my hair has changed colour. Actually, I like the colour as it is much lighter with shades of silver. A new hairdresser also complimented me on the colour and said that many younger women were having their hair dyed this colour. It was apparently on “On trend’. She then spoilt it by describing it as ‘beige’ a colour that in my view magazines like to describe the invisible elderly. I try to exercise daily especially in ‘lockdown (Covid)” my husband is also 70, we play pool daily in the summer and since the weather has got colder we have dug out The Wii and play tennis or bowling. We also try to walk each day once the day trippers have disappeared from the beach. I make an effort each morning and shower and wash my hair. I put light make up on This is for my benefit as I believe that stopping caring for yourself is a downward slippery slope. I have a dread of being seen as dirty or smelly!! I visit the dentist and hygienist regularly. I have an absolute fear of losing my teeth. When I worked as a counsellor I worked with a man who had lost his front teeth. My own teeth always hurt after he had left the session, to point of me taking paracetamol on occasions! I have only lost one tooth and that was down H1776 to an overzealous dentist who probably couldn’t be bothered. It doesn’t show though as it is at the back of my jaw. Health and well-being are extremely important and I am pleased that this is taught much more openly ion schools now. Today this emphasis is not just on physical health but emotional well-being also. A great advancement since my schooldays. I just wish they would bring back social dinner breaks instead of the canteen style. I doubt thought that the young people would agree."

I remember at the time being horrified at the way the Chinese citizens were being treated if they refused to adhere to the stringent lockdown rules. People and streets being sprayed with disinfectant and some residents being dragged into ambulances. It seemed so barbaric but in retrospect perhaps some more harshness wouldn’t have gone amiss in the UK.! We had a holiday booked for April 12th. We were to fly to New York stay for a few nights and then embark on a Transatlantic cruise back to Southampton. My daughter and friends also had a holiday to Tenerife booked for around the same time. There was much discussion about whether it would be safe to go. We all thought at that time that it would. Little did we know. I have now written some of the experiences from the past three months. If they are dated they were written at the time others are thoughts and memories in retrospect. 3rd March 2020... We have decided that we do not want to go on our holiday regardless of whether we are reimbursed or not. It is just too risky, so today we cancelled the day tour we have booked for our tour in New York and got an immediate refund thank goodness. I have also cancelled our day trip to Honfleur as part of our cruise. We are trying to get as much money back on sundries as possible as at the moment the cruise company isn’t cancelling. If they don’t cancel we are unlikely to get our money back. There are several cases of Coronavirus on Princess cruise ships. 16th March 2020 At indoor bowls this morning I felt slightly nervous about mixing with other players due to the spread of Coronavirus. The numbers seem fairly small at the moment but there is some scary talk around. Italy in particular sounds a terrible place to be the rapid spread is very frightening. A bowler came in and immediately started coughing and saying that he feels under the weather and then stating he has just flown in from Tenerife. Why oh why has he come. I stay the other side of the room all morning. We decided afterwards to give bowls a miss for a while. 12th March 2020. We went to Sainsbury’s to do a shop in case we are forced to stay in. It was like Christmas it was so busy but we managed to get most of what we needed. I wore gloves the whole time, the only drawback was the touch screen when going to pay only accepts skin contact so that worried me. I sanitised my hands immediately. 15th March 2020 things seem to be getting serious now with the spread of the virus. We are being told to socially distance ourselves particularly the vulnerable and 70’s and over. We are just coming up to that age and I have had lung problems for many years so feel even more vulnerable. I have a few friends all roughly the same age who will soon have to restrict their movements so I have set up a support group for us. The over 70’s isolation group. We had our first meeting this morning down at our beach hut. Four couples all sitting 2 metres apart from each other. We had a laugh and a chat but there was definitely an air of uncertainty. 19th March 2020. I have a really bad lung pain all week, I think that I got a chill on the beach whilst meeting our friends. Eventually I phoned the GP and he wanted me to go for an X-Ray because of my previously problems. I was really nervous about this. I had had a bad chest infection in early January so was unsure of what to do. I had a feeling that the hospitals might be a hot bed of virus infection. We eventually did go up to the X-Ray department and were actually in and out within 15 misn. We didn’t even have to pay the car park fee it was that efficient. I was prescribed anti biotics but didn’t really get to see the GP as lockdown had suddenly come into force. All I know from the doctor’s receptionist is that I have to have another one in three months’ time. Not sure why but because of the crisis I didn’t want to bother the GP. We will decide that in the future I think! We now know that officially we have to stay indoors so our group has retreated to an online one via WhatsApp. Keeping each other supplied with info about online slots at supermarkets etc. also sending jokes and videos. It has been a scary few weeks with far more to come. On the 25th of March the Government asked for 250,000 volunteers to help with shopping delivering medicines etc., 405,000 volunteers signed up in 24 hours. People the size of the population of Coventry, it makes you proud. Easter Sunday. 2020 The Pope gave his Easter Sunday address from the closed St Peters Basilica, an absolutely magnificent surround. The Archbishop of Canterbury gave his Easter Sunday address from his kitchen in Lambeth Palace what a contrast.! Not a good one either, I found it a little embarrassing. Sometimes we need a little Pomp and Circumstance. The builders on the site next to us are carrying on as normal. Sitting together in vans or on our wall having a cigarette there is no distancing what so ever. There has been such a tremendous surge in people wanting to rent an allotment that we have now closed the waiting list. We now have a waiting list to go on the waiting list. I guess the plots will sadly stay vacant for a while as we are not allowed to show people around. What a waste of time and growing potential. Still rules are rules and are there for a reason. The beaches are deserted but someone has written a “Stay Safe” poignant note with out of the chalk rocks. ../Pictures/Photos%20Library.photoslibrary/resources/media/version/1d/00/fullsizeoutput_1d24.jpegThe local Face Book page erupted yesterday when three people were spotted surfing. Suddenly there are online vigilantes talking about distancing etc. I am not sure how I felt. They were young and of course thought themselves to be invincible, the annoyance would be if they got into difficulties and had to call the rescue services out, who would then have no choice about social distancing. A young couple over the road have constant visitors from their family, all crowding around the gate on a daily basis. It is getting a little tiresome. They are not adhering to any of the guild lines about family visiting or social distancing. barely staying safe. 1st April 2020 My brother who lives in the Ilse-of Man has been rushed into hospital this has been frightening for my niece. And very worrying for us. She said that the paramedics were gowned and masked which seemed to make it more serious and frightening for her. He has had the Covid 19 test but this will be a few days for the results as they have to be flown to Liverpool for testing. He is 72 and has COPD and apparently has been told that if he has Covid he will NOT be put on a ventilator. This is dreadful. April 3rd 2020 Good news is that he hasn’t got COVID but does have pneumonia. He was discharged on the 5th April as it is deemed unsafe to be in the hospital. The daily death toll is looking to overtake Italy. I assumed Italy was bad because of all kissing hello obviously not, 15th April 2020 at last our holiday has been officially cancelled. No doubt we shall have to wait some while for a refund. We have been offered 100% cash back or 125% future cruise credit. Who knows what the future holds so have opted for a refund. We are doing Online grocery shopping at Sainsburys, and because I already have an account can do a click and collect. It is getting addictive. And quite good fun. At the moment though some of the basics are in very short supply flour rice eggs yeast etc. Meal planning and eating now seem to be in the forefront of my mind from waking till bedtime? Sourcing our usual wine is proving difficult. I have resorted to sending away for 6/12 bottles at a time from online wine merchants as Sainsburys have run out of our usual tipple. We shall all be heavy drinkers by the end of this. Most of friends say the same. With no one eating out and, on the beach, we wonder what the seagulls are eating Thursday night there was a hand clap for NHS I actually felt this to be slightly weird...seems the public either love it or hate it What news that Boris Johnson the Prime Minister has the virus and even more shocking when he was taken into hospital and then intensive care. This is getting really frightening. Famous people are dying some of natural causes, the papers are so full of Covid 19 they are not getting the usual grand obituaries. I wonder what Prince Harry thinks so far from home. I bet that he is regretting his decision to leave the country with Megan and the baby. He must be really worried about his family and friends especially as prince Charles had also had the virus. The Queens address to the nation with the theme of we’ll meet again was watched by millions I watched it and it was poignant, it made me a little emotional. It feels like we are fighting a real war. Thinking of TV, some of the programmes filmed at home just don’t work. Have I got news for you being the worst? There is a plethora of celebs doing little sound bites from their own homes to keep fit etc. Have to say not interested they have all become Irrelevant somehow. I am happy to watch repeats of drams and comedies. We have been watching the Covid 19 update from Number 10 everyday but it seems to be getting a little tedious. I just wonder what is going on in the rest of the world apart from this virus. We are trying to keep fit., by playing pool and working on the allotment. I am doing jigsaws, and going to bed earlier than usual. I wonder if people are no less likely to visit A&E and the GP surgeries I am thinking more about the hypochondriacs and time wasters, will habits change for good I wonder. I hope so. what happens in the future I think that I will be always wary of walking close to others. Today the Post lady tried to deliver parcels to house opposite today. They were out and she was clearly frustrated. I offered to help and take them in but she said she was not allowed she had to go back to the van do paper work and retake the parcels. She was grumbling* that it was worse than Christmas but with only half of the staff. She said she couldn’t understand people ordering paddling pools and fake grass. I can, actually if you are stuck indoors you need something to do. Just a strain on services I guess. Life goes on, Great Tits are nesting in the box and Robin is out singing. Feels today on April 22nd that people are relaxing their fears there seems to be more people passing the window. I went for one of my twice weekly walks but stayed on the cliff top as there were so many dog walkers on the beach. We can’t use our beach hut which is a pain, especially as it costs over £1000 a year to rent. Never mind better safe than sorry. Lovely weather this week we have been working on the allotment and rejoicing in the asparagus spears that are emerging. The birds are singing and the general feeling of well­being this brings makes this emerging crisis seems invisible. How hard it must be to be living in the city or a small flat with family. All on top of each other. I bet domestic violence and abuse of all kinds have increased. Boots have stated they can be a safe point for sufferers of abuse...not sure whether this is fake news as I can’t see how they manage that unless they allow them to use the phone? May 12 2020. Hurrah all our money has been refunded for our cancelled holiday. Monday June 1st 2020 A very sad today as a neighbour four doors down is being buried today. She worked in a London hospital and contracted the virus about 6 weeks ago and has been in a ventilator for some time. She leaves behind a husband and two teenage children. The numbers at the funeral are restricted and the family cannot travel to the cemetery in the funeral cars. All of the street came out and stood in respect as the hearse left. A colleague of hers gave everyone a pink rose and we walked to the harbour and threw the roses into the sea and sent her on her way so to speak. It was very sad and very sobering to know someone that has died of this dreadful and unforgiving virus. The next day the daughter wrote a heartfelt plea on social media for people to take notice of the restrictions and not meet up in crowds. She said that she was heartbroken at the sight if so many people taking no notice of lockdown. Part 2: Spring Covid 19 Update Health (some comments may be repeated from above) repeated sections are in italics My daughter who lives several hundred miles away was very unwell at the beginning of the spread of the virus. She is a single mother and had no one to get shopping or medicines etc., her ex wasn’t being that helpful although he did take the children. I was sending her a thermometer pain killers and throat sweets etc, by post. She was unable to speak to 111 as her throat was so bad but managed to email them. they just said stay indoors. This lasted over 3 weeks and she messaged to say that she had a bag packed in the hall in case she had to contact an ambulance she felt so ill. She was very alone and we felt very helpless. It would be good to have a test available for anyone that has been severely ill to see whether you have had the virus. 19th March 2020. I have a really bad lung pain all week, I think that I got a chill on the beach whilst meeting our friends. Eventually I phoned the GP and he wanted me to go for an X-Ray because of my previously problems. I was really nervous about this. I had had a bad chest infection in early January so was unsure of what to do. I had a feeling that the hospitals might be a hot bed of virus infection. We eventually did go up to the X-Ray department and were actually in and out within 15 minutes. We didn’t even have to pay the car park fee it was that efficient. I was prescribed anti biotics but didn’t really get to see the GP as lockdown had suddenly come into force. All I know from the doctor’s receptionist is that I have to have another one in three months’ time. Not sure why but because of the crisis I didn’t want to bother the GP. We will decide that in the future I think Our GP surgery will only do telephone triage, you are not allowed into the surgery unless by invitation of a GP. 1st April 2020 My brother who lives in the Ilse-of Man has been rushed into hospital this has been frightening for my niece. She said that the paramedics were gowned and masked which seemed to make it more serious and frightening for her. He has had the Covid 19 test but this will be a few days for the results as they have to be flown to Liverpool for testing. He is 72and has COPD and apparently has been told that if he has Covid he will NOT be put on a ventilator. This is dreadful. April 3rd 2020 Good news is that he hasn’t got COVID but does have pneumonia. He was discharged on the 5th April as it is deemed unsafe to be in the hospital. Monday June 1st 2020 A very sad today as a neighbour four doors down is being buried today. She worked in a London hospital and contracted the virus about 6 weeks ago and has been in a ventilator for some time. She leaves behind a husband and two teenage children. The numbers at the funeral are restricted and the family cannot travel to the cemetery in the funeral cars. All of the street came out and stood in respect as the hearse left. A colleague of hers gave everyone a pink rose and we walked to the harbour and threw the roses into the sea and sent her on her way so to speak. It was very sad and very sobering to know someone that has died of this dreadful and unforgiving virus. The next day the daughter wrote a heartfelt plea on social media for people to take notice of the restrictions and not meet up in crowds. She said that she was heartbroken at the sight if so many people taking no notice of lockdown. My husband had a hospital appointment with his consultant re a pelvic fracture. This was eventually rearranged and the consultant rang him at home and rebooked a face to face appointment for 6 months’ time. Emotionally I think that we have fared reasonably well. I am quite a fan of peace and quiet and do not needs crowds of people around me. I am missing the family of course but we can use the computer to see and talk to each other. I am enjoying the freedom from the rigidity of attending some meetings and clubs etc., all guilt free. If I haven’t read the book of the month for our book club it doesn’t matter we will not be discussing it. News Initially we watched all of the broadcasts re Covid avidly but this has really lessened off now. There was too much endless hour after hour. The Number 10 Government broadcasts were always a must, but less so now. It used to irritate me that the BBC never quite managed to start the broadcast on time always seemingly taken unaware that the PM or ministers had started. The charts were a bit boring, it was mainly the infection and daily death rate that we really wanted to know. I just wondered what we have missed that has gone on around the world that has gone unreported. A good time to break bad news so to speak as it probably wouldn’t have got a mention. The big news for us was Dominic Cummings breach of lockdown rules. Definitely one rule for him and one for others. We couldn’t believe that he still remains in office why? We wonder what does he know that we don’t. Work and Home Life We are retired so our daily routine has been unaffected. My daughter has been able to work from home but has had to manage two teenage boys and try to get them to do school work at the same time. They are at state school and have a certain amount of work set. But there is reluctance to do it. My sons’ children are at private school and the difference has been marked. The children have had to register on line each morning and they have a full lesson plan every day. Money makes a difference. The challenges for all of them have been huge. My son is self-employed so has had no income and doesn’t qualify for any help from the government. A big worry. Technology We have using Messenger to video talk to family, WhatsApp between friends and occasionally the good old-fashioned phone. We haven’t ventured onto Zoom yet but that may come. Shopping and food As I said before we have embraced on line shopping. We order food and my husband collects. This is extremely efficient and mostly we find a slot to suit us. The longest between shops have been 10 days, but that was only once. I have just started going out to the local fishmonger as they open very early so I can go out when it is quiet. Only one person is allowed in the shop at one time. I pay by contactless card so all pretty safe. I do not want to gout otherwise. The tourists that have been flocking to our seaside town has been horrendous. No social distances at all. We blame Dominic Cummins for this, people have seen his “getting away with it” as permission to flout the rules. There are no toilets open no car parks and no cafes. The streets are teeming and there is a stink of urine in the air. We are staying in. Entertainment and Leisure We have a very large allotment so that has kept us busy. It is about 20 meters from our house so perfectly safe to go to. We spend two hours a day there. We also play pool in the evening and sometimes board games. With the weather improving we can sit outside. There are plenty of jobs to do around the house but apart from clearing out a few drawers none of the jobs on the to do list have been done. We have probably done less in fact. Somehow it feels like permission has been given to let slip a bit. Personal Hygiene. This has stayed the same, daily showers and hair wash. The only bad thing has been our hair. We have just plucked up courage and given each other a hair cut after watching some tips on YouTube. The results have been ok. My next-door neighbour has grown a beard and now looks 5 years older. Sleep This has stayed much the same, sometimes worry about family has kept us awake. But we don’t need to rush up in the morning so it doesn’t really matter. Two of grandsons have been very worried, one refusing to go to the corner shop, and the other younger one afraid of going to sleep in case he dies. Very sad. Finally: The amount of death and infection to come as a result of this virus is truly dreadful. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but it does seem as if this country and government have been complacent and at times too slow to act. The PM being in hospital has slowed things but may have made a difference in other ways. He may be more empathic. Wearing of masks etc., why put a date in the future to start wearing them, travel restrictions should have been put into place much sooner and lockdown extended in terms of visiting beauty spots beaches etc., Let’s hope it all improves soon.

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. ‘Health’ means more than an absence of illness. In other words, it is so much more than having your options for life being impeded by specific behaviours, fears, uncertainties, discomfort, pain determined by the state of your body or your mind. I define ‘health’ in terms of feeling and living well in body, mind (and spirit?), able to make positive choices for self without restraints of dis-ease. ‘Wellbeing’ is for me a work-related word, as I have a professional role which aims to support and help develop the wellbeing of University students. It’s a holistic concept, which relates to the wellness of the physical body, the emotional life of a person, their psychological health (mental health) and their social health. If these human needs which relate to these areas are held in a healthy balance, then this results in wellbeing. Good wellbeing also impacts on our ability to learn well. ‘A healthy body’ for me, conjures the following 5 words: 1. Wellbeing 2. Mindset 3. Balance 4. Regenerating 5. Sleep An image? Maybe someone with an imperfect body – maybe older -walking on the beach/countryside, looking content and at ease with themselves. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? As a young woman growing up in the 1970s, just as many young women and men growing up now, I became very body conscious and wanted my body to be not just acceptable to the opposite sex as I started dating, but desirable, special – even ‘perfect’, which I knew it could never be. I was always highly sensitive, and tuned in to comments from a very young age, that influenced how I regarded myself and whether I was ‘OK’ or ‘not OK’. At university, for a period of my life, I went on extreme diets, never at all needing to lose weight, but because my weight was the one thing I could easily control, and I was good at self-denial with regard to eating. We think of younger people now being influenced by social media about how they ‘should look’, and we can easily believe anxiety and roots of insecurity about identity and self as being relatively recent. However, this anxiety is not new, though the means for individuals to experience it and the culture to feed it, are different. Then, it was fed by a magazine culture such as ‘Jackie’, and advertising targeted to nurture our self-image as being inadequate. As young women we were also learning that we should not be objectified, but it was still a common experience to be wolf-whistled – and then to feel undesirable if we weren’t. Social media and advertising continue to shape the robustness or fragility of people’s sense of inner security, and their wellbeing. Wolf whistles have been replaced simply by ‘Likes’ and emoticons. As a 61 year old woman, I would have thought when younger, that I would no longer be bothered by how I look. But I know, regrettably, that it still matters. I’m aware of how quickly on meeting someone new, we sum up what we think of them – at both a conscious but also sub-conscious level. So for example, I don’t want to be seen as having an easy life, because that’s not how I see myself, but yet ‘privilege’ is culturally specific, and in many cultures then of course I am privileged and can easily be seen in this way, not least by the appearance of my ‘wellness’. I have a chronic health condition (Type 1 diabetes) which will never go away, and in many parts of the world this would be a huge problem for me. But I have access to great health care, and so I am able to enjoy my health to the full. I am also aware that in the Western world, Type 2 diabetes is a growing health concern and cost, affecting ever greater numbers of people. Because Type 2 diabetes, (as opposed to Type 1 diabetes), is a lifestyle-related disease – linked to excessive consumption of carbohydrate I find myself hugely irritated by commentators who lump both Type 1 and Type 2 together – as if I also have to take some responsibility for my condition. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? ‘Health’ for me was managed mostly by my mother, as the one who monitored both my brother’s and my wellness. She was the one who took me to the doctor when needed. However, she wasn’t too good with blood, so I assume my dad must have taken over at the point when blood was flowing much – though I don’t really recall that, so maybe we never really hurt ourselves too much. Health wasn’t a topic we discussed too much unless we really needed to, though I recall the little medicine cabinet being stuffed with the same things year on year: Vick, Germolene, Disprins, ‘Febs’ – for colds, plasters, TCP. As I became older, and more aware of my mum’s anxieties, I recognised her as having an element of fear about pain, blood, deterioration. She did talk to me at an older age, about the difficult birth she had had with my brother, how he nearly died, and the damage it caused her own reproductive system resulting in a hysterectomy when in her 50s. She also had an op when she was much younger to do with this, but she didn’t like to discuss it, or maybe thought it inappropriate? I don’t recall discussing ‘health’ at school too much, though I do remember a lesson at primary school when I was about 10, in which the teacher was explaining about arteries and veins, and the memorable element to this was not so much about the content of the lesson, more about the fact that one of my classmates fainted. I recognise that there was a lot I would have benefited from knowing more about, as a young child and a sensitive child. For example, I had a very occasional Stye on my eyelid, and because my parents never really gave me any information about what they were and what to expect, I believed them to be a sign of something very wrong, and to be feared as they were painful. I learned health-related things as I grew up, and from those I knew who experienced health issues. My dad broke his ankle, so I learned from him things like how long it took bones to heal. Never about pain levels, as he never mentioned that. My best friend had her appendix removed so I saw it in a jar(!) and learned a lot about the pain of that. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? My first experience that I remember of my own bodily changes came when I (eventually at around 13) had a bra. My mum had taken me to a rather traditional outfitters that also supplied my school uniform, and although I didn’t need a bra at that age, I was more than happy to be fitted with my first teenage bra. I recall learning about menstruation mostly from my school mates, most of whom started their periods a long time before I started mine. My mum told me nothing – well, very little. In fact, when I was 9, I came across some sanitary towels she had bought and not yet taken to her bedroom. I asked what they were and she rushed away saying she had to go and talk to dad. After hanging around for what seemed like ages, she came back and I had a hissy fit, saying I didn’t want to know anyway. I had learned that this was too embarrassing a topic and too difficult to talk to me about. When I did start my periods, I mumbled something very vague, and although she was then very practical about it all, I still didn’t really know what to expect, or more importantly, how to handle it. The handling of all information about puberty, by parents/care-givers and the experience of learning about how your body will inevitably be changing, is so precious and determines so much about how people develop into the adults they become. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Since having Type 1 diabetes, I have consciously considered the importance of a good diet and exercise. Generally, I haven’t struggled with these areas of life. Up until COVID 19 took hold and we went into Lockdown, I had been going to the gym at 6.30am before work every morning apart from weekends, when I would be out walking with husband/family/friends. Since Lockdown, I have developed the practise of running in the mornings – although when the ground is too muddy or slippy, I walk. My husband and I have also been walking together every day. I have been doing yoga for many, many years and don’t struggle at all with the concept or practice of relaxation. My yoga practice continues and I attend between 3-6 online classes a week. I love it. I honestly believe this contributes to sound mental health as well as good strength and reasonable flexibility and balance for my age. Certain things have shifted for me though: 3 years ago I fell while ice-skating and broke my wrist. I had a bone density scan which indicated that I have some osteopenia – in other words, my bone density had declined more than would be expected for someone my age. My son is a physio, and he has advised me of the importance of doing weight-bearing exercise. I’d like to say I do this everyday, but apart from yoga, I can go a little while without. Must try harder….. I am much more aware of my body now, certainly have been within the last 5-10 years. Last summer I did a very short online course on MSK health, and after learning about the steep decline in body strength to be expected, along with overall deterioration in physical wellbeing, I vouched to do all I can to protect, strengthen and look after my body. So even just getting up out of my chair and moving around frequently when working all day at the computer, hopping on one leg then the other to make my husband laugh. All this helps. I do expect my health to deteriorate as I age, and in all honesty, I am very fearful of this. Both my parents experienced horrible decline: mum developing Alzheimers which she was able to conceal until the point when dad had a severe stroke and she had no idea what to do, leaving him on the floor, covered by a blanket overnight. Her dementia led to aggressive behaviour – she was terrified. My dad had to depend on carers to come in and manage his needs as well as oversee his wellbeing from a safeguarding perspective. My brother and I, both living a good distance away, felt helpless, it wasn’t possible to have them living with either of us for various reasons and all we could do was hunt out suitable residential care for them. My mother-in-law has been doing a national campaign to raise positive awareness of the elderly, emphasizing that you can be old and happy. However, she has recently had a stroke and is now having weekly falls. She had been a senior physio, but now struggles to get up from the floor when she falls. She has had a brilliant brain but is now trying to come to terms with the fact that she can’t still lecture or do public talks, or TV interviews – or even just teach bridge. She lives 5 hours away, and we are in another COVID Lockdown. Once again, I am left feeling somewhat helpless and very concerned. Old age seems to have little to recommend it. My expectations are not hopeful. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Health and wellbeing can certainly be linked to external appearance – very sadly. We live in a culture which celebrates youth and beauty. It is very easy to become anxious about not being ‘young enough’ or ‘beautiful’ or maybe just ‘too shy’, and therefore seen as a ‘wallflower’, someone who doesn’t stand out enough, is apparently ‘boring’. I now notice that older people in adverts tend to illustrate people with conditions such as erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence. They may also feature as smiling grandparents – but even then they may be considering how to pay for a sensible funeral plan. Ok, I can cope with this, but I often dislike this artifice of the ‘perfect world’. For those younger, not seeing themselves as having that perfect skin or shape, or the celebrity status that can only come with being so ‘desirable’, anxiety is fuelled with discontent. We are led to believe that we should all be able to achieve happiness, and therefore with this perfect life – its what we can expect to have. But I don’t think this is a default state for the human race. Contentment and appreciation of who we are and what we have, never mind happiness, is not compatible with a consumerist society. I have been influenced by ideals of beauty in many respects – (see my earlier reflections on Identity). I learned from a young age that I wasn’t really pretty, and that I was too shy and awkward to be very popular once I’d progressed from Infants School. Now, I am comfortable with who I am, but it took me a while to get here, and a journey that progressed through a number of years of disordered eating. However, it probably did take me into a career of professional Psychotherapy, which I may not have otherwise considered, so for that, I am thankful as its been a great career. Were my parents influenced by these ideals? Yes, to some extent, but I believe just my mum was, and only to a limited extent – and even now, I’m struggling to come up with an example, so maybe its not true. My dad didn’t really care how people looked, as long as they were honest people. I guess for my mum, she could be a little of a ‘social snob’, certain people mattering more in her social landscape than others, because of who they were, what their status was. My dad cared nothing about that. Neither of my parents put great pressure on me or my brother to be someone we couldn’t be or didn’t want to be, and they gave unconditional love. That is a huge gift I have had from birth. What could I not live without? Difficult to answer as there is a difference between what I regularly use every day, and what I couldn’t live without. I would struggle to be without my toothbrush and toothpaste. I also like to use moisturiser every day and my skin would now feel dry without it, likewise handcream – but I could always improvise. Hair wax I use on an almost daily basis – without it, my hair can be flat. I have no need really for make-up, wearing very little of it. I am happy to wash my hair with just water, happy to go without soap or deodorant, but forever? Probably not. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My mother always got up earlier than my father in order to prepare his breakfast. He would get up – as late as possible – wash and shave, get dressed and eat his breakfast (bacon, fried bread and fried tomatoes). I remember nothing more ritualised than that, but I believe for a period of time, they had a ‘TeasMade’ contraption beside their bed which acted as their alarm clock while steaming into gear to produce a pot of tea. I have memories of our dog as a puppy, running off with one of dad’s socks while he was trying to get dressed, and then him feeding the dog with his bacon rind, which the dog sat and waited for, somewhat impatiently. When they went out in the evenings, I recall my mum sitting at her 1950s dressing table (which I still have), putting on a little make-up, but nothing much more than powder and lipstick. She didn’t take much time over it, but she didn’t need to, as in her younger days she was attractive. She seemed to brush her hair a lot more than I ever do. When I was very little, I remember her going to bed with curlers in her hair and a hairnet over it all. It must have been very uncomfortable. The clothes she wore were important to her, and she had prepared them in advance, getting them out well in advance. My pre-socialising preparation ‘ritual’ is very slapdash I think, and hard to call it ritual, or routine. Depending on the event, I will wash/shower. I very often have no idea what I will wear, and can frequently change my mind a number of times, using up precious tens of minutes that I haven’t allocated for the task. If my hair appears flat or in the wrong shape, I use wax to poke it into shape – I like it messy, the ‘dragged out of a hedge backwards’ look. Maybe a little hairspray to retain the messiness. Then finally a little eye makeup, depending on event – not much more than eye liner and mascara. And that’s it. If I’m going in to work (Pre COVID-19 days), all of the above would be done in the gym changing room after a workout, with the only difference being that I would have prepared my outfit the night before. That said, I still might have 1 or 2 alternatives – just in case."

But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Whatdoes “health” meantoyou?Whatdoes “wellbeing” meanto you?Howdoyou define these words? For me, health relates to my physical state. Despite having Osteoarthritis and Raynaud's Phenomenon, I think I am still healthy because I have nothing that might stop me from being active, no breathing or organ issues. Wellbeing, on the other hand, is my overall state, be that physical, mental or self-caring. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term . Posture, condition, strength, supple, lithe Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Some people like Ashley Banjo. Phillip Schofield, Nigel Havers Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I was certainly influenced by my social class in the in my formative years, the 1960s. I come from a working class background, parents from the East End of London, so food was looked at as fuel and was seasonal, less processed and basic (no pasta!), unlike now when various food types and health benefit go hand-in-hand and there are some who want good looking food, no wonky carrots! All were entirely acceptable when I was younger. All of my friends, both male and female seemed to be naturally slim and there was less evidence of obesity. I recently met up with an old friend who I had not seemed for close on 50 years and it was interesting from old photos we shared, to see that both of us have retained a similar build and weight that we had as teenagers. I do not think that gender and sexual orientation has had any influence. Ethnicity has not influenced me at it has always seemed to me that your ethnic background might determine how you look, for example a lot of Asians tend to be shorter than their North European counterparts. I think that all my friends were slim, naturally meant that you would consider that the healthiest thing for you and it has been something I have tried to continue as I have grown older. Although I have Raynauds and Osteoarthritis, I am still at a similar weight (10 stone) as when younger and until a recent hernia operation had rather luckily never stayed in hospital or had an operation under general anaesthetic. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Unless you were part of the scientific community, I do not think that there was much talk about ‘being healthy’ until at least thirty years ago. Before that people were defined and healthy or ‘suffering from poor healthy’ or perhaps ‘having mental problems’. Then in the early seventies, John Yudkin wrote a book entitled ‘Pure, White and Deadly’ highlighting the damage caused by too much sugar in our diets. From then on there appeared a mass of information produced by scientists, magazines and newspapers. Certainly, at that time there was then more interest being paid not only to sugar levels but fat and even eggs (hat tip to Edwina Currie), Wellbeing has appeared more recently at the start of the New Age way of life where there was more of a holistic approach to health that meant that body, mind and soul were as one. Although I was never an out and out New Ager, I certainly bought into the incense, crystals and food that was part of it. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Although my father would try to ‘build me up’ physically with Ribena and concoctionssuchasraweggsinmilk,itwasalwaysmymotherastheprimary ‘carer’. She was the person who supplied the Haliborange vitamin C tablets, instructions on how to care for hair and teeth and at one point why a smallpox injection was necessary. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Where did these conversations take place? I do not remember much advice being given by my parents; it appeared to be a source of embarrassment to do this. My father perhaps mentioned STDs (not a term used at the time) and this would have been along the lines that the Royal Navy imparted where he served. My mother’s only advice was ‘do not bring any trouble home’ whenever I went out with friends. On reflection, I think this covered both breaking the law and getting girls pregnant! Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? No health or sex education at school, not even a biology class. Any knowledge that was required came from friends or others in school that had somehow had learned about them. There were of course, ’dirty magazines’ but I am not sure now that their role was to inform! The internet was not available when I was thirteen years old. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I suppose the first sign would have been about 13 years old when the majority of my class in an all-boys’ school started having moustaches. The growth of pubic hair was also a sign of recognition. . My voice breaking was another pointer. In my case, it meant the end of my days in the school choir. I liked the deep voice but not the fact that I cannot sing in tune. Then, of course, the desire to masturbate and the dire warnings about the practice that seemed to be attached Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? I think that shaving was the important ritual for especially when the moustache that had appeared or as it was referred ‘bum fluff’ was removed, inmycase by myfather who instructed me in the art. I watched him shave many times as a child and then a couple of times when older to get instruction. The first attempt was as expected a tad bloody as razorswere open ‘cut-throat’ or ‘safety’ razors, no five-blade Gillette’s at that time. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? The feeling that most of those I when having that first shave was that you overnight, grown-up or a man. You had attained maturity and you could show some swagger. All a bit premature as you soon found out when you started to work and earn a living and treated as the ‘boy’. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Staying healthy has always been a priority and has been so since I discovered girls and wanting to be attractive and smart. As have grown older, it has become even more important to me as the crux of being alive for many years. I have no great fear of being aged, but to be healthy, mobile and having all my faculties is extremely important. I think this became pivotal when I reached fifty years old and one realises that your youth is slowly departing. There was a period in middle age where I started jogging regularly as my work schedule had changed and there was time. However, this only lasted for about three Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services years and work demands did not allow sufficient time to carry. A regular swim on a Saturday morning for over twenty-five years has been the mainstay of my exercise and has not only kept me well but made new friends as well. Covid-19 has halted this and I now rely on walks either outside or when the weather is poor, on a treadmill that I purchase some years ago. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? A lot of my information comes from various serious websites such as the NHS MIND for example. I do not buy magazines such as Men’s Health as they are aimed at a specific market and do not apply. I use a local health shop for various items mainly seeds such as sunflower, pumpkin and flax but find that you can get swept away by the amount of so-called good stuff so one has to be selective. I am lucky enough to have an excellent GP and Pharmacist and both have been extremely helpful when it has been necessary to consult them. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Growing older has meant that I have become more of my body especially because of my Osteoarthritis, the need to be a good weight, have rest and movement. As previously mentioned, I am determined to stay well and live a good few many years yet, thus being conscious of one’s health is an important aspect. This is certainly going to continue throughout the rest of my life. Health, wellbeing and appearance Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I think there is some correlation between health and wellbeing and external appearance in that if you feel well and look well, this is a tremendous boost to your confidence and attitude. I suspect many of us who have had a heavy cold and simply stayed at home, not shaved and worn an old comfy and warm tracksuit. You feel rubbish and end up looking rubbish!! However, I have never been influenced by the popular ideals of physical appearance. We are all individuals and I can never be the same as say George Clooney for example so why try? We have to find our path and accept what we have. I would never go for cosmetic surgery because I was not happy with some aspect of my physical appearance except when this is required for medical reasons such as burns. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My parents were never influenced by these kinds of ideals, they were too busy working and bringing up me and my sister. My mother used make-up and my father used a hair cream such as Brylcream, but certainly not envious of the film stars of their day. I think they might have been a tad envious of the money they had though. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? My shaving kit and moisturiser cream would rank high and perhaps some factor fifty sun-screens if the desert island was hot. I shave every day to keep up to standard Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services and have used a moisturiser for years to keep my skin dry and soft – nothing worse than rough skin! Importantly it makes me feel more whole as a person and have the integrity not to let myself go. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? I remember my father was the one with a ritual once he was ready to go out. He would pat himself down and recite “wallet, keys, handkerchief, and comb”. Only would he go out when he touched each item in its respective pocket. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? When going out to work I would prepare clothing and bag/briefcase the night before. When driving to travel, I would prepare lunch or snacks the night before to save time. The morning would be the usual shower, shave, moisturise, breakfast, clean teeth, dress, check everything in place and go. For a social night out with friends, it would start by selecting the clothes I would be wearing followed by a wash and shave, moisturise, clean teeth and then dress. I have adopted my father’s ritual of the pat-down and call-over in all cases of going outbut have added ‘phone’ as he didnot have a mobile phone untilmuchlaterafter I had moved out of my parent’s home."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? My issues both physical and mental have been very minor and have fluctuated between feeling a bit low or very positive – essentially quite normal. Initially, the lock-down presented minor challenges like making sure we had sufficient food supplies to meet an unknown period and as I was self-isolating the difficulty in getting online shopping slots. It was fortunate that two of my children live close by and they were happy to provide shopping services! A few weeks into lock-down, I started to get slots for online shopping which helped considerably: so getting the essentials was a challenge that created some stress but all manageable. I have not required any medical help. Physically, I should have gone for a walk outside more often but my wife was unhappy about doing this in case people were not observing social distancing. y. However, I have had a treadmill in the spare room for many years and we both used this so we have been able to exercise. and we have started to do more outside walking in our large local park and intend to keep this up in non-pandemic times – if there will be one! I am an avid reader and learner, so my early thoughts were that there would be plenty of time to do both. However, my wife whilst finding some solace in This Morning, thought we should be ‘doing stuff’. Using online shopping for paint and decorating supplies, we have decorated two bedrooms and the main bathroom. I have also undertaken the task of replacing sealant on various windows and sinks etc., so this has provided more physical exercise and the satisfaction from completing the tasks has provided a good boost for us both. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services I think it worthwhile declaring my position here. I am a pacifist and left winger and also a member of the Green Party, CND and Global Justice Now. As such, neither this Government nor Boris Johnson curry much favour with me. My main thoughts on the political decisions made by this Government are that there has been too much politics involved in their decision making and the public health of the population has been not as considered as it should have been. It always seemed that the economy and growth were ahead of anything else but too many neo-liberals and free marketers were involved so this was always likely to happen. I would also cite that fact that the leading adviser ignored the restrictions and did not receive any punishment for doing so, a monumentally bad political decision. In mitigation, one could argue that the situation has not been one that has had to be dealt with previously but in my opinion, the lock-down did not start early enough, there was insufficient questioning of scientists in considering all available options and they did not learn from those who had faced the pandemic earlier. If they had done so I believe that the overall death total would have been substantially less. The PPE situation and the lack of management and consideration to care homes was a complete debacle and should never have happened. On the plus side, the furlough scheme and the help to those self-employed were good as was the drive to make the financial sector offer ‘holiday periods’. I am writing this at a time when non-essential shops are open and in a week, pubs, and restaurants will be allowed to open. The recent good weather has meant thousands have flocked to beaches and ignored social distance and other advice and I believe this could give rise to a second wave of the pandemic. This means that all of the scientific advice to go slowly with raising the lock-down will be for nought and restrictions will be imposed again. Johnsontalks of “no moreausterity” and a surge in infrastructure spending toboost the economy. Sadly I think it will not help the unemployment figures that will almost certainly rise and I wonder where he plans to get the cash to meet the costs of new infrastructure. He either has to borrow, hike the taxes or give an impression of being positive and decisive but with no real thought or cash – a bit like the garden bridge that failed miserably. Thus, I think that “no more austerity” may not apply to the elites! News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services I have little or no faith in mainstream media and cancelled all of my social media accounts some while ago. I rely on several trusted internet sources to provide details of the pandemic in this country and others, especially Europe and the USA. In this way, I can keep up-to-date with the measure being implemented on a wider basis. The Economist has been a good source and some of their Leaders will have made uncomfortable reading for this Government. Other sources include The Conversation, Open Democracy and Jonathan Cook. I have watched the daily briefings but generally find that after about 30 minutes. There is little of substance so my main reason for watching is the get the numbers and detail of changes to the lock-down policy. I heard somebody say that the briefings had been dubbed ‘Hancock’s Half Hour’ alluding to the less than inspiring Health Secretary, Matt Hancock and this sums up the situation nicely. I saw an interview with the Icelandic Prime Minister who stated that she left most of the briefings to “the people who know what they are talking about” namely the scientists and the heads of public health. In this way, she felt that the population was being given accurate findings without any political influence and I applaud this thinking. The question about the use of BSL interpreters is a no-brainer – why would you not have them? Current events around ‘Black Lives matter’ just emphasise the need to have equality throughout our society and to have an interpreter is one tiny piece in the overall picture. I am an admirer of Nicola Sturgeon and why Boris Johnson could not have followed suit is beyond me. Going back to an earlier point about looking at the ways others have dealt with the pandemic, Johnson should have looked at her and other female leaders, such as Angela Merkel in Germany, Jacinda Arden in New Zealand and Katrín Jakobsdttir in Iceland who have done a lot better than those countries led by men. Despite having little faith in the BBC which seems now to be the mouthpiece for this Government, I have watched the news that follows the briefing to get a concise picture of the briefing waffle. I sometimes feel that their Health and Science editors, Hugh Pym and Fergus Walsh respectively seem to fit to burst with indignation over the Government’s handling but have to follow the managerial line! Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? At age 73, I am still doing administration for a Consultancy headed by a friend. This is not onerous and usually takes 2-3 hours per week. So essentially, there has been little change in work habits. The content has changed somewhat in that updating various databases have become the primary activity but for me, the work I do helps maintain the grey matter. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services Two of my children and their partners are working from home and have had to adjust to keep themselvesmotivatedandfocused. Inmyelderson’scase,thismethodcouldbecomeanearlyfull­time method of working as his company are looking to implement the method as a way of reducing the cost of office space etc. My youngest son is a self-employed website developer whose primary workspace is his flat. He has very little work but has received the funding from the Government to compensate. This has taken any worry about rent payments etc. He has been walking regularly and is our shopping backup but has had to take steps to ensure he does not fall into binge-watching Netflix and visiting the fridge for snacks 27 times a day!! The main impact for my wife and I in self-isolation has been the loss of seeing our children in the house and holding them. The ones who live close by have ‘visited’ from the end of the drive for brief chats. We have also instigated a Sunday family Skype session where we all meet up for a chat for a couple of hours but it is not quite the same thing as having them physically near. My daughter has been very nervous about Covid and is not looking forward to a return to work – she is a special needs teacher – and is fearful that her College may not have all safety measures in place. This has meant that my wife has been called upon to provide additional comfort via Facetime etc. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I deleted all of my social media accounts, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest , YouTube and Instagram earlier this year when I realized that I had spent over an hour trawling through Instagram. I have developed a growing distraught of the sites and their usage of my information for some while but the Cambridge Analytics issue more or less convinced me to cut and run. I also read Cal Newport’s book ‘Digital Minimalism‘ andagreed with his thoughtsthatby using these sites we were changing our attention span and ability to read and work more deeply. I am an avid reader and learner but was finding my time on these was being eaten away by using social media and this had to change. Whatsapp and Google accounts have remained for the time being. The latter being for work and the former for two reasons. Firstly, an enterprising neighbour set up a community account so that those like myself who were self isolating could call upon those who were not to pick up prescriptions, newspapers and groceries etc., to help out. This has been extremely worthwhile and useful. Whatsapp also enables me to call and see my family easily and without cost. Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services On a weekly basis on Sunday afternoon, we have had a family meet-up via Skype and this has been great. Not only does everybody get a chance to chat and see each other but we have a lot of fun and laughs having a ‘pub quiz’ usually of twenty questions on any subject created by one of us in rotation. This means that depending upon who is the creator, my wisdom scores high but can be very low when they have questions on latest music etc. Nevertheless, I can take something away and find out whether I should listen or watch. Having headed up an IT department and with a web developer son, not a great deal of today’s apps or forms of technology are that new to me but it is interesting to see how these are being adapted to daily use. I still have concerns about the ethics of Artificial Intelligence but that is for another Directive perhaps. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? As already mentioned, there was difficulty, initially, in obtaining shopping slots, but over time with the introduction of more being made available by the supermarket chains, it did become slightly easier with Asda being, for us, the most successful. A tad galling that my wife worked at Tesco for over 25 years but no favouritism shown but that’s life.Trying any of the other chains was a waste of time. I can remember back in the late 1980s when we had a bad winter trekking around in the cold and snow picking up shopping as and where one could find shops that had been able to get a delivery and one really has to be thankful that during the pandemic, this has not been the case. We have already seen evidence over the past few years in the gradual demise of High Street style of shopping and the growth of online ordering. What has surprised me is the range of products available online from plants and shrubs to DIY kit, paint and household requirements and health products. I usually frequent a lot of garden centres in the summer but this year a pretty successful display in the garden has been created via my laptop. Is this the new shopping? I suspect so, not for everything but unless there are specialist shops in a town or High Street, ‘goingtothe shops’ might be an outdated exercise. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had hoped to get a lot more reading and studying via various MOOC courses and whilst the reading time has been reasonably good, there has been no study. The reason for this is having found it was possible to obtain paint and DIY items online; I was under pressure to decorate two Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services bedrooms vacated by daughter prior to lock-down when she moved in with her partner. Why two bedrooms? Well, one was used as an actual bedroom and the other for storage mainly of her clothing and her work papers (she is a special needs teacher). These were completed and I was then on a roll in completing other outstanding DIY tasks. I was very disappointed with the programmes on television. Apart from one or two drama series, thank goodness for Vera and Endeavour, the providers seemed to rely upon reruns and repeats of programmes first aired 10 years ago – do we really need another viewing of the James Bond films? Fortunately, I am a subscriber to Netflix so there were a number of films and documentaries available to watch. ‘The Last Dance’ about Michael Jordan, the basketball giant was an intriguing insight of what make a champion. I had been making a habit before the pandemic of trying to pick up a variety of books from charity shops, charity tables in supermarkets, library book sales etc., to try out different authors and genres. So in addition to the likes of Robert Harris, Mick Herron, Ursula le Guin, Anita Brookner etc., I also took on some political history with Peter Hennesey, Bob Woodward and Nick Davies there were also books by Daniel Berrigan, Sven Birketts and Gabriel Kolko requiring a lot of thought. A lot more attention was paid to the garden as I had more time and this looked the best it has done for a couple of years. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? For me this is of considerable interest as I am one of those people who do not understand why you should downgrade this aspect of life just because just because you are at home for any length of time. My father was in the navy during WWII and imparted aspects of his naval training to me. So, shoes were cleaned every night before work next day, your clothing was always hung up correctly at the end of each day irrespective of what time or state one arrived home! I was also expected to shave and bath/shower regularly. I even still get out of bed at the same time that I did when working full time, 6:30am. This routine continues today. I shower, wash my hair and shave on a daily basis. Apart from trousers and sweaters, whatever else I wear is changed daily. You have to maintain some standards in life to maintain integrity. At my age there is also the need to avoid what I call the care home fashion of tracksuit trousers and slippers. Sorry, that sounds very politically incorrect but results from visits to my in-laws in care homes in the past, this seemed to be the uniform. I suspect that I am generalising but it is a look that I wish to avoid as I am sure that it increases the ageing process. I remember some years ago, when my then very young son passed Chickenpox onto me and at that time I was off work for nearly six weeks. At that time, yes standards slipped because I was Sex: Male Location: Wickford, Essex Age: 73 Occupation: Self-employed Consultant – Financial Services unable to shave etc., and too weak to get out of bed for about a week. However, I think that there comes a point where if you do not make an effort, the decline will never be overcome. I am very conscious that this all makes me sound very pompous and have no intention of being so but part of me is actually being clean and smart. Like many people, I would really like to have my hair cut. I am beginning to look like my 15 year old Beatle cut but on steroids!! Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. I have osteo-arthritis and am in chronic pain. Not hammer on thumb pain but a body that aches permanently. At the onset, I was waking up five or six times a night and was prescribed Amitryptilyne, a mild anti-depressant relax me during the night. Thus there has been nothing unusual about my sleep patter throughout lock-down. However, a side effect for me of the drug is very vivid dreams, usually of activities or scenes from my past but with additional people appearing. It is like watching a video of one’s past being rerun. It usually wakes me, I calm down and go back to sleep with no recurrence of the dream. I wonder if the insomnia and nightmare that some have experienced is due to not maintaining their normal routine as if going to work. Certainly, when I stopped my office based work, I had similar problems but found it all settled when I went back to a ‘normal routine’. It does mean any plans to have a lie-in go by the board though!"

Obviously, health is important but when people trot out phrases such as ‘well, as long as you’re healthy that’s the main thing’ they are just repeating ideology. Other things are important in life too. Having said that, discussions on these topics have become particularly charged because of the Covid pandemic and that apparent opposition between economic requirements and health-related requirements. I say ‘apparent’ because I think it is a false opposition – the best thing all round would be to eliminate the virus or failing that (obviously we are comprehensively failing on that), achieve immunity through vaccination with the minimum of lives lost. But if we can just leave the context of the pandemic aside for one moment, then I would say that prioritising health and wellbeing is simplistic and ideological because at some level it is a means of trying to control and police individuals. It sets up a context in which ‘unhealth’, for example having diabetes, can be seen as an individual failing or as a result of the wrong ‘lifestyle’ choices. There shouldn’t be a distinction made between fit, able-bodied people and those with disabilities, or those who are old, or those who don’t fit the ideologically-imposed notions of perfect bodyweight etc. This is not to say that information about healthy diets and exercise shouldn’t be made available (I think schools should do healthy meals and there should be widespread public provision of leisure centres and swimming pools etc). But there needs to be an awareness than this emphasis on ‘health and wellbeing’ fits in with the neoliberal ideology of the last 30-40 years. It is not necessary to make a hyperbolic comparison with Nazi ‘strength through joy’ ideology, to point out that the underlying purpose of these ideas is to engineer human behaviour, through a combination of ‘nudge’ theory and violent compulsion. The hidden reality of ‘health and wellbeing’ is the thousands of deaths caused by austerity politics over the last decade; in particular those resulting from the outsourcing of sickness benefit assessment to private companies, who are notorious for classifying people with conditions such as terminal cancer as being fit for work (see e.g. ‘Thousands have died after being found fit for work, DWP figures show’, Patrick Butler, Guardian, 27 August 2015; ‘WCA death doctor: DWP put “immense pressure” on Atos to find claimants fit for work’, John Pring, Disability News Service, 5 December 2019). The other flipside to the ‘health and wellbeing’ agenda of recent years is the rising level of depression and anxiety in society (which has ben exacerbated by the pandemic and the associated lockdowns; more than 6 million people in England received antidepressants in the three months to September – ‘Antidepressant use in England soars as pandemic cuts counselling access’, Pamela Duncan and Sarah Marsh, Guardian, 1 January 2021). There is clearly something fundamentally wrong in British society which I think is directly related to the use of data and metrics for purposes of performance management and the construction of league tables etc. These phenomena are no longer deniable and therefore institutions and organisations which are implicated (such as schools, universities, hospitals, public sector employers and other large companies) have taken to promoting wellbeing. It is not that I haven’t taken advantage of some of these offerings from my own university, such as setting up family-friendly flexible working and using the counselling service available through the ‘Employee Assistance Programme’ during the pandemic – and obviously these are good things in themselves that are to be welcomed – but I still can’t help feeling cynical about the fact that management prefer to make these provisions without reducing workload or performance management (in fact, while increasing both and arguing aggressively that they are not doing performance management but staff development). Recently, I have consulted an outsourced occupational health consultant on my return to work following an extended period of sick leave with post-viral syndrome (see my ‘Covid Diary’ entry for Monday 7 December 2020). To be fair, I quite enjoyed the conversation and we agreed the conditions for a phased return to work later this month (January) but the institutionalised values came through in the insistent checking that I wasn’t sleeping during the day, that I was increasing exercise and the implicit logic that I would only really count as fully well when back at work. In fact, the logic was pretty much that only be returning to work would I fully be able to recover and become a *normally* healthy person again. As it happens, I do want to recover and therefore I am increasing exercise but, at the same time, paying attention to my body and ‘pacing’ myself etc. I don’t need a physiotherapist to prescribe a routine to me (fortunately the pandemic ruled out me being ‘made’ to see one). I don’t need CBT to put myself in the right frame of mind (this was also offered). At some level, it is clear that people are not trusted to get themselves well (it all seems a bit like a secularised version of the Catholic Church with compulsory confession). I will get well and resume unrestricted the things I like doing such as long walks and writing books etc. But I refuse to think of my utility lying simply in my employability. Anyway, for all these reasons, I’m not going to define or imagine what a healthy person is or share the first five words that come to mind: all people are equally valuable! Identity I’ve never lived in poverty and I think that must be a huge influence on my experience of health and wellbeing. We know that being on the wrong end of inequality leads to reduced life expectancy. Similarly, I’m white and as the current pandemic has highlighted, BAME people are disproportionately affected by health issues. These forms of inequality are intersectional: i.e. if you are a working-class person of colour, the social inequalities you experience are likely to be intensified and therefore there is a greater likelihood of having your health impacted negatively. I’m bisexual but I’m in a long-term relationship with a woman, whom I’m married to, so I have in effect straight privilege (I don’t suffer any discrimination). Similarly, I’m nonbinary but given that I’m amab and look male and have a prestigious job, I can’t claim other than to benefit from male privilege, which also influences health indirectly. Having said that, I think my sexuality and gender identity do have some bearing concerning how I experience health and particularly mental health. In my case, I think this is on balance positive because, as stated above, I haven’t suffered the negative consequences of discrimination, but I’m not trapped within a restrictive normative understanding of my identity configured around the damaging hierarchies of straight maleness. This is not to say that I haven’t experienced considerable anxiety and uncertainty at different parts of my life and, at times, felt very unhappy with my own body. I probably would have felt better at times, if I had felt more confident in myself and this might mean perhaps that I would be less overweight today for example. It’s difficult to say: we’re all made by our life experiences. In some ways, the fact that I live a lot of my life in my head – not in a ‘Walter Mitty’ sense but in terms of books and the imagination and thinking – is more influential on my health and wellbeing than other considerations. This means that I will privilege the concerns of my mind over my body; and the fact that I have derived more satisfaction from the life of the mind than the life of the body is partly due to the fact that the mind is less subject to normative constraints (in that you keep what you’re thinking to yourself). This is to some extent bound up with sexuality and gender-identity (I can see in retrospect) because I learnt in childhood eventually to keep certain thought to myself because otherwise people found them strange or ‘daft’, as my dad used to say. That’s probably true for everyone to some extent but I never lost those strange ideas and feelings but jut internalised them. A Freudian perspective might well see this as narcissism, but we have moved beyond Freud. However, I think some of the brave new world of CBT, occupational health, health and wellbeing still adheres to that rather straight and narrow conception of what counts as a successful adult entry into the symbolic order and life according to the reality principle. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My parents, and particularly my mum, were responsible for looking after my health and wellbeing as a child. We didn’t have central heating until I was 5 or 6, so a lot of this entailed staying in the room with the fire in winter and being covered in talcum powder after every bath. If I had a cough, we got cough medicine from the chemist. The doctor would do rounds in those days and so I remember him coming when I had measles (which is, rightly, vaccinated for today) and chicken pox. I don’t remember many conversations (we were a very suburban, lower-middle-class ‘nice cup of tea’ family) about health beyond the need to eat fruit and vegetables and go for walks. We/I walked to school as a matter of course even though my mum had the car when I was young. Any education about health was limited to the Biology curriculum (I wrote about the extremely minimal sex education at school for part 2 of the Summer 2019 directive) at secondary level but I don’t remember much. I don’t remember very much mental health education either (in those days before PSE and PHSE) but we did do stuff about suicide, drugs, gambling etc in RS. I don’t think I got health education from magazines either – not until I was in my early 20s and started reading the Guardian. I learnt about body odour (‘BO’) from friends and therefore I had to ask my mum about getting deodorant, rather than that idea being communicated the other way round. Key moments I got bigger – I’m very tall – but I don’t particularly remember having growth spurts in the way that my own children have. I remember having nocturnal emissions and not quite knowing (but also kind­of-knowing) what that was about. I remember my voice being squeaky but not quite when it fully broke. I was masturbating guiltily and intermittently by 14/15. I guess I first shaved when I was 15 or 16 – my parents made me put it off for a bit because ‘once you start it just grows faster’ but they did relent before things got completely ridiculous (I was never quite the last kid to be in the know about the various aspect of growing up – possibly because I was just about smart enough to cotton on when I was getting out of step). Are these things particularly important? No! I don’t think they need to be. We used to make a bigger fuss of them but nowadays I think we talk to children more and give them some more idea of what is happening and e.g. let them have whatever they want (bra, shaving) if they want to try it out without making them wait (or let them wait if they want to wait). I think this is right and that these things should be no big deal. Having said that, there is still a gendered difference and some of these changes can be more difficult for some girls because, for example, they find themselves growing and developing quickly and therefore being subjected to unwanted sexual attention from boys and men. However, I think this kind of behaviour has become more unacceptable than it was; at least within peer groups. I think the reason that these gendered rituals still seem so important is a structural consequence of the way we (as a society) still uphold a binary view of gender. This is embedded in the question you ask: ‘Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example?’ These are the key rituals of a binary-gendered society but I don’t think they are necessarily defining moments in life or symbols of adulthood or independence, which even for cisgender people are more likely to be sexual experiences or going to the pub or voting (for me, for example, one key moment of entering young adulthood fell on 29 July 1981, when aged 16, I went to a ‘Not the Royal Wedding’ Gig at Churchill Garden, Bromley, and then to the pub that evening). But not everybody is cis or one of the two binary genders. One reason I can be flippant about my adolescence is because I don’t consider my voice breaking or my first shave as particularly formative moments. In retrospect, the first time I consciously cross-dressed at around 15/16 (as opposed to childish dressing-up) was far more significant for my eventual understanding many year later of myself as nonbinary. At the time, it was just another thing like masturbation about which I felt vaguely guilty. I knew it was ‘wrong’ from a societal point of view (in the early 1980s) but I still did it because I liked it and it felt right. Ultimately, that double consciousness helped me break free of the prison cell of normative thinking. But we wouldn’t have to go through that kind of formative experience if we just got rid of the restrictive norms in the first place and, particularly, if we scrapped the rigid gender binary and accepted that it is a spectrum. Growing older In term of physical exercise, I walk a lot both in terms of choosing to walk rather than taking a bus and walking for pleasure and exercise. I will walk up and down stairs rather than a lift if I don’t have luggage and it’s, say, three flights. In recent years, I have made a conscious choice to have exercise every day; mostly, by going out for a walk but we do have a good exercise bike now. This is also a mental health measure because it gives a break from constant round the clock work demands. I don’t think there are any significant things or events that have changed my practice, it’s more of a gentle evolution. I still get information about health and wellbeing from newspapers and like many people I will look something up on the internet if I desire to know more. I am more aware of my body now. As I’ve said, I’m recovering from post-viral syndrome and that has forced me to pay a lot of attention to how my body is feeling so that I can pace myself and not trigger another bout of ‘post-exertional malaise’. I’ve written extensively about this recently in my ‘Covid Diary during November and December and so I will only briefly summarise here. I had a virus in March which I didn’t think was Covid at the time because I didn’t have a persistent cough or a high fever; and I didn’t seem to be ill enough. I recovered and then – taking advantage of the lockdown to reboot a healthier lifestyle – tried to take longer walks and exercise on the static bike. I was doing well, I thought, riding 20km in an hour on the bike and losing weight. But then I started to get recurrent bouts of malaise, which culminated in a complete collapse into fatigue at the end of September. So, in this respect, I was trying to take advantage of a changed situation in order to make lifestyle changes but it didn’t go quite right. What I’ve learnt though is to pay closer attention to what my body is telling me and to rest if I don’t feel good. So now, that I am much improved from the end of September, I am exercising more carefully by, for example, riding the bike in an easier setting and not pedalling so hard and just stopping if I feel I need to. I’ve taken to reading while on the exercise bike so that the whole process is time efficient (and I don’t slip into the track of exercising harder in order to minimise the time loss). This is not because I’m working flat out but because I want to do a lot with my time and I want to find the most efficient way of doing this without damaging myself. A few years ago, there was a lot of focus on ideas of ‘healthy ageing’ or ‘successful ageing’ – an area that I did some research in (i.e. as an academic) and published on – with a focus on staying healthy as long as possible and then dying quickly with as minimal a cost to the state as possible (I’m being satirical). As part of this agenda, it was suggested that people start preparing for retirement by having classes from the age of 50 and so on (this was before the Government decided to ramp up the retirement age). At the time (c2009-10), when I was 44/45, I thought this a bit ridiculous as I had a three-year-old child and two teenagers at home and felt in many ways that I had only just got my career on the road and therefore it was a bit soon to be working on preparations for winding it up. Now, ten years later and in a different career position with a teenager at home and two adult children living away from home, I feel differently; not that I want to take lessons, of course. I do want to segue to a less pressured life where I have more time to do things I want and can balance them with getting healthy exercise. The pandemic – despite my post-viral syndrome – has been a good chance to reflect because it has given me nine months off a 450+ miles weekly commute to work. I don’t want to go back to that full-time. I don’t have to while the pandemic is on because I won’t have to do on-campus teaching until next year. So, I can either go part-time in September or retire, having turned 55. I wouldn’t be able to live entirely off the pension but I should be able to make some money in addition to that. In conclusion, the way I plan to change my approach to health and wellbeing over the coming years is by changing my life and the way I work. But I need to add that I don’t think this is just a ‘natural’ response to getting older; it is also a consequence of the huge changes in Higher Education – vastly increased workloads and invasive (but also inept and inefficient) performance management – over the last decade that have completely transformed the qualitative experience of the job. If it was still like it was before 2010, I might well stay on. On the other hand, I’ve also got to a point in my life when I’ve realised that it makes no sense to think to myself that I will do x, y and z in a few years’ time, or I’m sure I’ll be able to do that later. It’s come to the point at which I think if I really want to do something, then I need to do it now or at least make a specific plan for doing it. Health, wellbeing and appearance Sometimes you can see that someone is or has been ill but not always. Other than that, I don’t think health and wellbeing are related to external appearance although no doubt many people make judgments on that basis. I guess pretty much everyone is influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. My parents were not particularly influenced by these ideals. Neither am I on the whole but perhaps in the negative sense that (despite wanting to lose some weight) I wouldn’t want to be too slim because I like the way being fat transgresses middle-class values. My desert island item would be a toothbrush. Getting ready to leave the house With my parents, evening socialising used to involve my mum spending a long time in the bathroom and my dad shouting at her at intervals that it was time to go. In the mornings, she put on make-up and he shaved (in fact, I think he normally shaved again if he was going out in the evenings). I haven’t had that kind of routine for years because even when working on campus, there is at least a 6-7 hour interval between leaving the door and getting there. I used to keep my keys in my trouser pockets and if leaving in the morning pack my bag (in recent years, just a small rucksack) the night before. If going out socialising, I might well put on a clean shirt and maybe change trousers (depending on what I have on to start with) but it wouldn’t take very long. I’ve got a beard so I don’t need to shave, which is not to say that I necessarily would have shaved even if I didn’t have a beard. Nowadays (in the pandemic), the only ritual is to check I have a mask with me."

What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. When I think of health I think of it in terms of not being ill, in other words being able to live and active normal life without undue long term problems or ailments. Wellbeing, I feel is more about a persons mental state and having this balanced out to enable an active normal life without undue stresses and strains. A healthy body – not overweight, able to walk more than a few miles, eating good foods, not eating processed foods, not needing drugs or other stimulants. No one in particular comes to mind but we all know people who suffer from being overweight. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I am lucky in that I grew up eating a relatively healthy diet as there were few processed foods around when I was younger. The fact that I was tall and slim helped me a lot as I didn’t feel the need to diet or to use substances to try and enhance my confidence. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? I really didn’t think about it at all until I became older and came to notice others who were not as healthy as me or who were more unbalanced mentally. Going to work in London in the advertising industry which had more than its fair share of people with ‘problems’. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? It was always my mother and she would drag us down to the local doctor at the first sign of anything being a hypochrondriac herself. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Health and growing up type talks were just thrown in where appropriate. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? In school we were lined up in PE and our feet were inspected. It was with great joy that I announced to my mother that I had ‘an athletes foot’ and couldn’t understand her consternation. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Probably around 14 when girls started to become interesting rather than annoying. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? At that age everything is important. A pimple in the wrong place or lank hair can mean a loss of self confidence especially if picked upon by others older. Parents didn’t help by being sarcastic and saying things such as ‘no need to shave as hairs don’t grow on an egg’. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Dreadful, just wishing they hadn’t been said Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life?  I have been lucky in that my lifestyle was one of much walking, cycling or being active from the age of about 18 to 50. Even after that walking was still important. Breaking an ankle on black ice and being forced to be on crutches for three months was a key backward step. This led onto irregular heartbeat and pressure of work at the same time made me ill enough to spend 15 days in hospital. It has taken a good five years to come out from that and to maintain some sort of fitness while being unable to be active. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Generally online. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I am more aware of it in that I find steep hills harder to climb, find very cold weather a problem and that walking more than about five miles is tiring. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change?  No, I cannot forsee much change as I know from seeing what my Father did to himself by sitting in a chair for years on end and not being active. It got to the point where he could hardly move. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Yes, if you are healthy and well balanced you project this in your walk and manner. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? No, I view it that we are what we are and we have to make the best of it. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? No they were quite balanced and tended to be very normal. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Good toothpaste, otherwise I use very little in the way of products. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? My father used to prepare everything the night before when he went to work, so his cereal bowl would be out and the teapot ready. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I now work from home so there is little variation in my clothing from day to day. In fact a few years ago I decided to by several pairs of the same jeans so that I didn’t need to think about what to wear. It is more a seasonal change now so that winter includes hats and scarfs and summer lighter weight clothing. Also when socialising I tend to wear the same clothing as I am happy in what I wear at all times. ends"

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? Howdo you define these words? Answer: Health means being well, not having an illness or serious health condition or being disabled in any way – though, having said that, someone who’s blind or deaf (I’m using shorthand here) or in a wheelchair can still be healthy. It’s mainly a physical thing, though – unless prefixed with the word ‘mental’. But even then, it means being mentally well/healthy, not afflicted by anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, paranoia, whatever. Wellbeing I guess means something more holistic – physical and mental wellbeing, being at ease with the world and one’s place in it, one’s circumstances. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please sharethe first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Answer: Fit, in-good-working-order (one word!), able. But then again, referring back to my previous answer, the Paralympics show all sorts of people with all sorts of disabilities who are otherwise healthy and fit. I know people who are extremely (sometimes competitively) fit – people who run, cycle, do ultra-marathons. On the face of it, they have healthy bodies – but who knows? Some of them may have cancer or they may be suffering from severe anxiety. Whereas you can also find people who aren’t particularly toned or activity­holics but who eat/drink/exercise moderately and whose bodies do what’s needed of them without strain. I’d say those people are pretty healthy. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Answer: My friend J. She had breast cancer in her 40s, is now in her 60s, eats fantastically (but not fanatically) well, drinks in moderation, exercises by walking, gardening, tending her allotment and weekly Zumba classes, is very slender, has had two children, now has three grandchildren, is very balanced, not prone to anxiety or depression. I’d say she’s a very healthy person in a very healthy body. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Answer: I grew up in the 1950s in a family where there were six children and not much money (my father was a gardener, my mother a fulltime housewife in my childhood). We always had enough food but not too much, probably had too many sweets and sugar-heavy drinks like Tizer and Lucozade (hence the tooth decay), ate fresh vegetables and fruit (some of which Dad had grown), sometimes drank milk straight from the farmer’s churn (rural living). Neither parent drank very much at all – Dad would have the odd beer when he could afford it, Mum the odd ‘Snowball’ – but only when I was in my teens. Much of our food was home-made, except when I was in my teens, when things like Vesta curries and Angel Delight desserts entered the house. We were never ‘foodie’ – and I’m still not, even though my husband has written hotel and restaurant reviews as part of his job (he’s no precious foodie, either). Nor were we ever exercise freaks – my brothers played football, but we three girls only did PE when at school. At that time (and, at times, still today) sporty girls were infra-dig, so we didn’t want to be like that. It’s a pity, because – for instance – when I was at a co-ed school after passing my 11­plus, I really enjoyed swimming. But when I then transferred to an all girls’ school (because it was Catholic, which my mother was), and swimming was seen less positively. That’s stayed with me all my life, which I’m sorry about. If I had my time again, I’d embrace swimming (I have tried in later years, but something’s always happened to stop my continued attendance at swimming classes). I loved hockey, too, but never pursued it. Ditto, tennis. Again, if I had my time again… However, walking has always been important. And, because my husband and I never owned a car until two years ago (despite him being a travel writer – we used public transport and taxis most of the time), we’ve always done a lot of walking, for instance from home through woods into town. (You mention ethnicity in the question – interestingly, in India, which we visit regularly, we’ve been told that only poor people walk, because they can’t afford transport. However, we have seen lots of rather chubby and very middle-class Indians ‘power-walking’ – though some of it is gentle strolling – through Lodhi Gardens in Delhi). I’ve done yoga as well, since my early 20s, with occasional lapses – but I’ve continued that during lockdown, via Zoom. At times, I’ve joined a gym, but I’ve always been rather half-hearted about it – at one, there was so much testosterone from the male gym-goers, it nearly knocked me out when I entered the building; at another, there was half-hour circuit training just for women, which I enjoyed, but then the regular bus service from my house to the gym became very irregular and, without a car, I lost heart. I was attending U3A keep fit classes for 18 months up to the pandemic, but of course that finished then, and the gym owner had to close down eventually as she could no longer afford to keep the building or pay the trainers. I did have a phone call yesterday with another gym, and have signed up for a half-hour free Zoom class – but I have to say I find the owner’s online personal statement rather offputting, eg “TheSmallgymwithaBIGheartismybrandsoul essenceandoneevenatthischallengingtimeismypassion.”Oh,dear… Do youthink your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Answer: I guess I’ve answered that above? When I worked at a university, I did have an annual ‘wellness’ check-up, which was useful. But I left there 18 months ago, and haven’t signed up for a similar check-up anywhere else. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Answer: I can’t think of a time when I wouldn’t have known about health. Wellbeing, though, would have come a lot later – maybe when I started yoga in my early 20s, or even later than that? Now, I do Mindfulness as well as yoga – and I do get a bit irritated when I read articles about yoga where the writer is reinventing the wheel, talking about the mental and physical benefits of yoga. Well, yes, that’s why it’s been around for thousands of years.. I also get irritated when the accompanying photos are of fit young women in leotards doing impossible feats. My fellow yoga practitioners have always been people (mainly women) in their 30s, 30s, 50s up to 80s, with real bodies encased in whatever teousers/leggings and tee-shirts are handy. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Answer: My parents and my schools. At primary school, we had a school nurse. Obviously, we always had a doctor as well, who would come to see us when we had measles, mumps, whatever (we lived in the country in my very early years). At primary school, we had daily school milk (a third of a pint) and orange juice, regular check-ups. Mum gave us cod liver oil on a regular basis (I still take it). At grammar school, we would have had lessons about health – wellbeing was taken care of in RE. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversationstake place? Answer: The short answer, I’m afraid, is no. They must have done – they were very caring and responsible parents -but I don’t remember them. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Answer: Again, my memory is rather vague – well, it’s a long time ago. I imagine I would have talked about it with friends – though, in the 1960s, I really don’t remember us talking much about anyone’s mental health. We may well have called someone ‘a bit odd’ or ‘she’s a bit strange/nervous’, but we wouldn’t have spent time talking about panic attacks or anxiety or depression. Nor would we have talked about ‘eating disorders’ – ‘she’s very picky’ is probably what we would have said. I’ve discussed all this with old schoolfriends, two of whom are now grandmothers, and we all agree on that. But we would have talked amongst ourselves, and checked out magazines like Jackie and Petticoat – and, later, Cosmopolitan – and got health tips from those. In fact, I used to cut things out and store them – things about losing weight and keeping clean – but more physical health information than mental health. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Answer: I have an older sister, and remember when I first realised she was ‘developing’ (she’d have been around 11, me about 9) and I blurted out, ‘R’s got breasts!’ She went bright red and ran out of the room, and my mother told me off for embarrassing her. I didn’t realise it was something to be embarrassed about. At our Roman Catholic convent grammar school, it was the RE teacher who seemed to have responsibility for teaching us about puberty, etc. Well, her and books such as My Dear Daughter, which was written by nuns in Liverpool, and told us not to be ashamed by bodily changes at this time – “Because remember, Our Lady too had a body like yours”. It also told us that, when washing ourselves in the bath, if we had ‘bad’ thoughts when washing our ‘private parts’, we should offer up a prayer to Our Lady, to save us from sin. As for periods/menstruation – again, my older sister got there first, but it was all very hush-hush (we had three younger brothers, and these things were definitely to be kept from them). Mum used to just give her sanitary towels when they were needed. When I started to bleed, I was upset and told my mother, who supplied me with the STs, too, and told me how often to change them, how to dispose of them. ‘Can I still go swimming?’ I asked her. Rather sharply, she replied, ‘Of course you can – you’re not an invalid, you know!’ I remember feeling that was unjust – how did I know, when she’d never told me about the facts of life? It wasn’t her fault, I know – she had six children, not much money, a lot to think about, her own difficult childhood and adolescence. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? Answer: I can only talk from my own perspective and experience. Growing up, my sister and I both wore lace-up bodices underneath our dresses or blouses. I’ve mentioned the first period above, but can add to that by saying that our RE teacher, Miss W, told us (in the lesson about periods) that, when she first ‘came on’ (though she didn’t use that phrase) her father bought her flowers to celebrate her first steps on the road to womanhood. My friends and I found that quite cheesey. For me, it was something to hide. So, when I was having my period, I would secrete a sanitary pad inside the waistband of my school skirt, hoping it wouldn’t fall out. That way, I could ask to go to the toilet without having to take my satchel with me, as a giveaway. Other girls must have been doing the same, given the very low number of girls who’d rush out of the room to the toilet carrying a bag of any sort.  One day, in the changing rooms after swimming, a particularly coarse classmate came up behind me, touched my leg with her finger and showed it to me, bloodied. ‘Ooh, look, C’s come on,’ she laughed. I knew I hadn’t – my period had started by then, but had finished the week before. So I just gave her a withering glance. In fact, she’d nicked her finger and made it bleed. But she liked embarrassing other girls that way – and in other ways. As for bras, I can’t remember my first one, though it would have been soft cotton and not very supportive. It took me a while to develop properly, whereas my older sister was more ‘mature’ earlier. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Answer: I think I’ve answered these above. It did become important to shave legs once they started to grow hair. It was very uncool to have hairy legs, or hairy underarms. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Answer: I’ve been blessed with a very equitable personality. I’m not breezy, certainly don’t take my mental health for granted, but in a family where both parents had anxiety (hardly surprising, given their lack of money, six children and homes that came with the job) and where two siblings are on medication for anxiety/depression, and a third has also suffered from depression – I count my blessings every day that I didn’t inherit the depressive gene. So I’ve never had to seek counselling or therapy or medication for anything related to mental health. I’ve done yoga since my 20s, Mindfulness meditation for the past 12 years, have studied Buddhism (as a non-Buddhist) also since my 20s. Growing up, I prayed (until such time as I parted company with the RC Church – with no animosity, just a gradual slackening and then final cut of the ties that bound me). I’m constantly learning new things, listen to classical music, don’t watch any films or TV programmes that I regard as upsetting/frightening (not since Clockwork Orange when I was 20 – that was the clincher). I’m an optimist, positive, find much to laugh at (and my husband makes me laugh, a lot). All of that helps, as does regular walking, an appreciation of nature, very occasional jaunts over the years into something more organised/strenuous, such as keep fit or swimming classes. I drink too much and eat too many sweet things, but I’ve been vegetarian for 30+ years, take cod liver oil, Vitamin C tabs, Vitamin D tabs, Visionace for my eyes, Amlodipine for my high blood pressure, and drink a lot of water throughout the day. I make sure I have regular dental check-ups, regular cervical smear tests and mammograms, and see the doctor about anything that bothers me. Apart from drinking too much, I do my best… Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? My sisters have kept me informed about health during the pandemic. I just absorb things from different sources. I don’t actively go looking for information, I’m not neurotic about my health, don’t Google things. I work on the premise that as doctors and dentists undergo around seven years of training, plus lifelong learning, that’s their area of expertise, not mine (or Google’s). I don’t expect a doctor to be able to make a radio programme, so why should I expect to be able to diagnose – and cure -cancer? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I’m aware that my body is now 67 years old, and therefore not as nice to look at as it was even five years ago. There’s some strange puckering around the navel (because my stomach muscles are so not toned) and my breasts not only sag a bit but are also getting a bit wrinkly. I know I don’t do enough toning exercise, but comfort myself with the knowledge that I do walk, do yoga and climb up and down 50 stairs each day, many times. So I don’t feel too bad about my body. It still works, and can still look good clothed. Plus, as my husband often tells me, it’s cuddly at night. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I don’t know. I guess, in my head, I’m always thinking I should go back to keep fit classes, the gym, tone myself more. But I’m just not that bothered that I want to devote time to that – certainly not to a gym (unless it’s for U3A people) – that could otherwise be spent walking in the countryside or just doing more interesting things. But then, in my head, I’m still 18-going-on-52, not 67. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? My immediate response is to say that a healthy person looks ‘better’ than an unhealthy one. There can be external signs of un-health: people being overweight, people with ‘smokers’ faces (sucked-in cheeks, lines around the mouth), people who have obvious physical problems, eg moving slowly and painfully around on sticks, people whose health is affected by poverty and poor education. Someone whose wellbeing is good may look calm, serene. But even as I write all of that, I imagine I’m being judgmental… Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Haven’t we all? I was a teenager in the 60s, when Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton were the role models – both gorgeous, both extremely slender, one with an androgynous look, the other definitely feminine. My friends and I loved those looks, aspired to them even though we didn’t live in London and couldn’t afford the clothes. So we made a lot of them ourselves. I do think now, though, that it’s like an epidemic – a lot of young women (I’ve seen this so often amongst my students) never feel they’re thin enough, or pretty enough, or pouty enough or false-eyelashed enough; girls who spend their time on Instagram, looking at impossible physical ‘ideals’. Some of those ideals – Kim Kardashian’s buttocks or breasts, for instance, or Botoxed lips – just look absurd to me, like something that should be in a fairground Freak Show. But what do I know – I’m in my 60s. I remember once, being on a train from Manchester to Sheffield, and sitting opposite a beautiful, fresh-and-freckled,  Scandinavian-looking blonde woman in her early 20s. To my horror, all the way from Manchester, she expertly applied the slap, transforming herself from a natural beauty into A N Other bit of street totty. I so wanted to stop her and say, ‘Don’t! You’re so lovely anyway – you don’t need all this make-up!’ But it was a packed train, and there were men on either side of us – and she didn’t make any eye contact. She got off at Sheffield, and I was all set to say it to her then, but her boyfriend came to join her, so the moment passed. But that horrible transformation from beauty to mask has really stayed with me. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My Dad – who was born in 1916 – liked women (and men) to take pride in their appearance. For men – no slouching around, hands in pockets, unpolished shoes, sloppy long hair. He found the 1960s a bit trying in that respect. For women, he liked ‘a well-turned ankle’, good legs, a little make-up but not too much. My Mum (born 1923) had little time to worry much about make-up, and little money to worry much about posh frocks (she had six children). But she was always clean, tidy, and made the most of herself on the little money she had – the occasional neat suit with defined waist, nice dresses, smart hats for weddings, etc. She was very good-looking when young – as indeed was my father – and they were of a generation where it was important to keep up appearances. Right up to when she died aged 92, she always looked lovely, with fluffy white hair and a taste for pretty pastel colours, good affordable dresses. When we were growing up, it was very important to her to turn us all out neatly and cleanly. And she herself could rise to every occasion – when she and my older sister went to a Queen’s Garden Party for former Land Army Girls, she wore a big posh hat and a matching lilac-coloured suit, smart shoes, unsnagged tights, decent handbag, gloves, etc. She was in her 80s at the time. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Make-up, I’m afraid. When the adjoining house to ours caught fire, about eight years ago, I was out in the back garden trying to hose down their conservatory when the fire brigade arrived. We were all told to vacate the house. Outside, the fireman asked where I was. ‘In the kitchen, putting on her make-up,’ said my husband. ‘Could you tell her to come out now,’ the fireman said firmly. ‘Otherwise I’m coming in to get her.’ No-one apart from my husband ever sees me without foundation, eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick. It’s not worth inflicting on other people. So my DID item would be my (full) make-up bag. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, orfor the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? See my brief comment above. At work, Dad was a gardener, so his ‘uniform’ was dungarees and shirt. On the rare occasions they went out, he would put on his tweed jacket, good shirt and tie, polish his shoes (he always polished all our shoes), and Mum would put his best trousers out for him. Mum herself would put a bit of lipstick on, maybe a dab of foundation, and another dab of perfume (nothing expensive as she couldn’t afford it), plus her nice frock, neat shoes and handbag. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? When I was teaching, I’d always do my best to look good for the students. I felt it was so important for them to see that they were valued, worth the effort. Sometimes I’d wear an Indian outfit (salwar kameeze-type) just because I have a few of those. I like long scarves and Indian dupattas, so would probably wear one of those. I love costume jewellery – nothing expensive, mostly bought from charity shops and junk shops – so would always wear a necklace of some sort and bright clip-on earrings. I still like to dress well -even during lockdown I’d sometimes get one of my best outfits from the wardrobe and wear that, even if it was just me and my husband at home. I like dressing up, wearing bright tights or leggings, something a bit Gudrun Sjoden, a bit alternative. My work and socialising routines actually aren’t much different – interesting clothes (I love dresses), bright accessories, make­up, contact lenses if I’m appearing ‘in public’. Plus Chanel No 5 perfume. That’s my one real extravagance. After all, if it was good enough for Marilyn Monroe… ENDS"

I’ll just add a few extra notes: Health: Thankfully, everyone I know has kept pretty well during the past year, apart from a brother whose anxiety & depression has worsened. However, he has sought help for that, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy – and is now back at work. He’s been very open with friends and colleagues about his ill-health, which has resulted in others telling him about their own mental health issues. Physically, though, none of my nearest and dearest have had Covid, though I do know through friends of others who have, ranging in age from mid-30s to 80+. One or two of those have been left with long Covid. The Government:  There have been times when they have handled this ineptly and badly. I eagerly await Dominic Cummings’ thoughts on the matter when he goes before a Parliamentary Select Committee in the next week or so. There is still (May 2021) a lot of uncertainty over what people can and can’t do, where they can and can’t go. However, the big success story is the vaccination programme. None of us can thank the NHS enough for that. News: I’ve very much rationed my news intake over the past year. There were months when Radio 4 in particular was like the scene in the Hitchcock film Blackmail, where a woman keeps hearing the word ‘knife…knife…knife’ in her head. That’s how I felt every time I turned on R4, hence my addiction to Radio 3. We’ve never watched much TV news, which has also been a boon. Our next-door neighbour’s 70-something mother has become more and more anxiety-ridden over this past year, because she’s been devouring the television news 24/7. Her daughter has tried again and again to get her to stop, but she can’t – she’s obsessed with the news, which has had a marked effect on her mental health. Maybe now she’d had the vaccines, she’ll calm down a bit. J7229 As for the Govt Press briefings – I’m afraid most members of the current Government bring me out in hives when I see or hear them, Boris Johnson in particular. So no, I have saved my temper and my sanity by never watching them. Work and home life: I’ve pretty much covered this in my coronavirus diaries. All I can add really is to say that, thankfully, my husband and I have always got on very well, and we make each other laugh a lot. Nonetheless, there have been times when I think he’s mentally slowed down – he’s become terrible at remembering names, for example, and gets facts wrong when retelling stories. That’s made me very impatient at times, as we’ve been together pretty much all day, every day. But he still makes me laugh – sometimes in the middle of my impatience – so the irritation has been nothing compared to what many others must have suffered over this past year. I’ve often wondered how working couples ­whose daily lives used to involve seeing each other only first thing in the morning and then in the evenings – have fared this past year. Two sets of neighbours are in that situation, both with two young children to home-school at times as well. But they all seem to have survived. Technology: Again, I covered this pretty extensively in my coronavirus diaries. Shopping & cooking: Ditto. I reckon we’ve eaten much better than usual, as I’ve been at home to make soups for lunch, and evening meals from scratch. But it also means we’ve eaten too much – and definitely drunk more than we did pre-pandemic. Entertainment & leisure: All I can add here is that I’ve started (but not finished) an online Introduction to Classical Music course. I want to take that up again, as it was interesting and useful. At one point, thanks to a book I’d bought – Year of Wonder, by Clemency Burton-Hill – I was listening to a particular recommended piece of music each day, but that’s gone by the board. I need to start that up again now, too. We’ve had almost daily walks as exercise, together with my regular Zoom sessions of yoga and Mindfulness (the latter including mindful movement). What else have I read? Various Moomin stories from the wonderful Tove Jansson – I only discovered them a couple of years ago, and they’ve been a great boon during the pandemic, with their messages of resilience, kindness, compassion and humour. Also Tove Jansson’s letters, and now her biography. Also The Time Traveller’s Guide to Regency Britain, by Ian Mortimer. I’ve read all his previous TT guides, too, and find them wonderful in the way they take you back in time, and bring previous eras alive. Again, there’s a lot to be said for being able to put the pandemic into a historical perspective, and learn about the hardships our ancestors would have encountered, and how they dealt with them (or not). J7229 Personal hygiene: This hasn’t changed. I’ve made a determined effort not to let standards slip. OK, I’m no longer standing in front of a lecture-or seminar-room full of students, but that’s no reason not to put on an Indian salwar kameez-inspired outfit, or a Gudrun Sjoden Swedish-influenced dress with bright leggings. Plus matching/mismatching earrings, necklace, ankle socks, scarves, whatever. I may not photograph myself in my ‘outfit of the day’ and post it on Facebook/WhatsApp like my sister-in-law does, but I still like to make the effort… Sleep: There have been nights of disrupted sleep, particularly early on in the pandemic. And yes, very vivid dreams, though I’m hard put to remember any of those now. But they were quite hallucinogenic in their colours, over-population of people, swirls of conflicting and overlapping events. My husband’s had them, too, as have other people I know – and have read about in the newspapers. I get them during my afternoon naps, too – where I’ve also discovered, much to my horror, that I sleep with my mouth open, so it feels revolting when I wake up, disorientated. As for what I do when I can’t sleep – usually, I’ll get up, make myself a cup of tea and a slice of bread and butter, read a bit of Agatha Christie, then go back to bed. Or I’ll stick my iPod on and listen to the hypnotic voice of my Mindfulness teacher reciting the 25-minute breathing meditation, and that almost inevitably puts me to sleep. That’s why I call it Beditation. ENDS"

I am not coming to this topic for the first time and my previous academic background will influence any definition I give. Five words 1. Active 2. Alert 3. Supple 4. Pain free 5. Blooming No person comes to mind. People are infinitely variable and the visible is not the full story. I think it is a mistake to pick certain body shapes or grooming as an ideal for health. I think the year one was born is important. I was born after the introduction of the NHS and penicillin. There were vaccinations for smallpox, TB and later polio. But one had a range of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and German measles which modern children are vaccinated against. There were epidemics of polio when I was very young. One heard of occasional outbreaks of smallpox and typhoid. It was important to avoid these. It was important to select food carefully at good shops and store food carefully. For example my mother would never purchase potted meat or cream cheese. Food was plain, seasonal and home made. It was important to take care about water quality in rural areas. My parents, the GP, the baby clinic in an old Victorian school, the school nurse and the local pharmicist were responsible for my health. I think wellbeing is a useful, but more modern concept. No. We learnt about food values in Biology, and this was a very useful topic. It was more useful than cookery, which can be learnt from a book. Home had a nineteenth century attitude that food was important in maintaining good health. I have read the nineteenth century volumes of the Lancet with interest as apart from some surgery and case experience it is food and nutrition which underpinned anything positive. I have paid attention to what I eat, not in terms of organic and non-organic but in terms of consulting my old MAFF ‘Handbook of Nutrition’ to ensure I have a balanced diet and keeping a food diary so I can search out seasonal fruit and vegetables. As I age I ensure I have enough daily protein. I like most vegetables but I avoid a certain group. I do not purchase prepared meals or sauces and I very rarely eat out. So I have control of my meals in terms of food values, fat, sugar and salt. I enjoy seasonal fruit and vegetables. I also check my BMI from time to time and avoid putting on weight. It is all a bit self righteous. I cannot avoid ageing, or unseen problems which might need medical tests to detect, but I do what I can to help myself. B 6659 I think it is important for me to have variety in activities each day, including absorbing hobbies, some exercise and seeking out new interests. My parents were not really influenced by transient ideals. They regarded make-up as necessary for actors. Neatness and appropriateness was the ideal. Character and personality were seen as important. I find it amusing to look at old photographs and to date them by the style of glasses and colour of lipstick. For a sojourn on a desert island I would probably chose a bath with hot water and soap as my luxury, to remove all the salt water. I would also chose a comprehensive book about plants, so I could find which were edible and the food values, and could study which plants would be useful to make a big hat, salves and lotions."

UPDATE SECTION: Health Nothing, apart from catching the coronavirus, and experiencing tiredness for a couple of weeks. I had a mild bout and live to describe it. I did not require medical assistance. I embarked on walking up the stairs to equal Everest. At first I was very tired but later I could easily fit in 600 feet or 1,000 feet while tea brewed. To date, I have passed Kilimajaro and am now ticking off peaks in the Himalayas.  I am in a fortunate position. I have hobbies, a garden, e-mails and the weather has been good. I have found it different but in a curious way it has not been unenjoyable. Knowing that everyone else is in the same position has made a difference. But my family and friends have been well upto now and that has been important. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? It was an impossible position. Without knowledge of the disease, whether people could be infected but not show symptoms, whether it could be passed on by those not showing symptoms, how it was transmitted, what proportion of cases would be mild, or serious, or fatal, it was fightingin the dark. The government did its best. There will have to be serious discussion of the policies and timing – but not yet. It is no use comparing the UK with other countries as different countries collect data in different ways. Only the excess deaths with illuminate the overall picture. It will be important to learn lessons as this may not be the last pandemic. It is always possible that this will be a rehearsal for future pandemics. What steps do you think the British government will make in the coming months? It is difficult to predict as their ideal will probably not coincide with practical necessity. The R number may rise if the lock-down is relaxed.  Also the population may be very cautious, whatever they are formally allowed to do. But there will be a need to get people back to work in some way. The daily updates Yes, I have been watching this daily. I do not watch the rolling news. I have the 6pm new on, but tend to be busy doing other things.  I like experts being present to comment and answer questions. I am glad the pool of questioners has been widened. I do not know anyone who has had difficulty accessing the news. I have seen the Scottish use of a BSL interpreter. It is a good idea. It made me want to go and find out more, but the library is shut. Work and home life. I am retired so have been in a fortunate position. One child is working from his home, one is on a hospital front-line and one is working as usual. The son who is working from home, and his wife, who is working from home, are also home schooling. I wish I could go and run the home schooling, but that is impossible. Technology I have probably been exchanging e-mails with friends more frequently. But I haven’t seen them. I do not use Zoom, Facebook and all these other modern methods. Neither do I shop on-line. People occasionally recommend You Tube items on random subjects. I do not use such methods to access news. Shopping I continue to shop in the village, once weekly for milk and once for everything else. It is slightly limiting but it is adequate. Flour has not come back onto the shelves. I would have purchased some rice if I had foreseen the lock-down. But there are plenty of potatoes. My eating habits have not changed. I am pleased that seasonal vegetables and fruit are available. I have tried a few new things. In honour of the VE Day commemoration I have read through my file of wartime recipes and have been doing a tried and tested recipe each day. Yesterday I included homemade fish cakes. Tomorrow I will include Woolton Pie. I will have to use a wartime pastry recipe, including potato, as I am using flour sparingly. Entertainment and Leisure I find I have time to think about my embroidery projects as I am not distracted by other tasks. As I both design and execute these I am making better progress than in normal times. I have done spring cleaning, which is not usually top of the daily agenda. I am making a wholecloth quilt. This is a new project which I would not have attempted without the lock down. I planned to try making dipped candles but I have not yet had time. I have made some cards to try tablet braiding. But I need to do more spring cleaning to find two colours of wool. What have I been watching or listening to? I am a creature of habit. I have kept a diary of the best each day so I can tell you, to date. I regret that broadcasts has mainly consisted of repeats. I have watched the Coronavirus Update daily, but have not always noted this. I have half watched some programmes, while doing another task at the same time.

But my hair is now much shorter, as I was due to go to the hairdresser when lock-down started and have used a hair clipper on longest setting. Fortunately my hair is not dyed or permed. Sleep I have experienced no problems sleeping. I am active during the day, get up at a set time, go to bed at a set time and read in bed for a set time ( unless I am at the end of an excellent book ). The village has been very quiet, which has been excellent. There has been a curfew, as an accidental consequence of the lock-down. Dreams I am afraid I have yet to remember any dreams, ever."

'Wellbeing' to me describes a state of being -how comfortable you are in your own mind and body, your local environment and the wider world. The two are inexorably intertwined. The first words I think of when I imagine 'a healthy body' are: . Lean . Muscular . Strong . Glowing . Primed The first image which comes to mind when I think of 'a healthy body' is Leonardo Da Vinci's drawing known as 'The Vitruvian Man', which shows the proportions of a human form drawn in 2 superimposed positions inside a square and a circle.  The figure is naked, male, muscular, strong, with a thick head of hair. Oddly, however, I do not think of my own body as unhealthy even though I would not apply any of the words above to its form. Identity I believe identity can have a strong influence on an individual's experience of health and wellbeing and can think of several examples based on my own identity. As a woman my health and wellbeing has been influenced by biology and in particular hormones. I started my periods at around the age of 12 and for 7 years experienced severe monthly period pains which were not soothed by painkillers but could be relieved slightly through use of a hot water bottle and going through various bodily contortions to find a more comfortable way of sitting or lying down.  The pain did not prevent me from going to school but did affect my concentration and sleep and the bleeding made me wary of taking part in sporting activities (particularly swimming) in case of leaking. I went to a girls' school and can remember on regular occasions more than half the class sitting out a swimming lesson having given the reason that they were on their period, but remember the PE teacher being quite rightly sceptical about the likelihood of this. At the same time I developed acne on my face and back which affected my confidence (which was already low), was uncomfortable and again made me more reluctant to take part in activities such as swimming where I would have to show my back. Only when I started taking a F4813 Autumn 2020 -Everyday Health and Wellbeing Page 1 of 9 contraceptive pill when I was nearly 19 did the acne improve and period pain substantially reduce; the accompanying regulation of periods also making life easier to manage. I have also throughout my life experienced a high number of urinary infections (again design of the female body makes these more prevalent in women) and now in menopause I am experiencing hot flushes and bladder discomfort and in place of the pill am now managing my errant hormones with a vaginal pessary. I am delighted, however, to be post-period. Although some medical conditions have a genetic/hereditary link affecting people from particular ethnic backgrounds (e.g. sickle cell disease is much more common in the Black population), social factors (including education, income, local environment, racism and other discrimination) can have a much stronger impact on an individual's health and wellbeing and studies on health inequalities in the UK bear this out. Being White, middle-class, financially secure, heterosexual, educated to postgraduate level, in full employment for 25+ years, living in a long-term stable relationship and a relatively clean rural environment I tick a lot of boxes for positive social factors which strongly enhance my chances of experiencing good physical and mental health. I believe, however, that one social factor did have a long-term impact on my health and that is gender bias. Between the ages of 19 and 29 I experienced a physical health issue with almost daily symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea which had a significant impact on my life.  Aside from the unpleasantness of the physical symptoms themselves, the condition affected my sleep (I was often awake many hours each night with vomiting and diarrhoea), my eating habits (I often didn't eat on the basis that the less I had in my stomach the less could come out) and my confidence, in particular in being out and about and not close to a toilet.  Anxiety and depression were also factors as I felt as if I would never feel 'normal' or well again.  I visited many doctors during that time, trying to explain the physical symptoms but also the impact on my life, but felt largely ignored or dismissed as a neurotic woman with irritable bowel syndrome which could only be treated for the symptoms -I never went anywhere without a packet of Imodium and took them almost daily. The majority of the doctors I saw were male and didn't seem to have any inclination to get to the root of the problem; eventually I insisted on a referral for further investigations, although even then my male doctor said he would make the referral against his better judgement. Numerous inconclusive tests later, it was only when I mentioned that in trying multiple different diets I had found that I felt better on a low-starch diet that I was tested for and diagnosed with the Coeliac disease which was responsible for the symptoms. The physical symptoms are now largely under control through a gluten-free diet but I am still dealing 20 years later with the affects of long-term anxiety, including a fear of using public transport and travelling abroad. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I think I first became aware of health at around the age of 4, as it's from that age I can remember visits to the dentist and doctor.  I was certainly aware that at times one had to suffer for the sake of improving one's health -I dreaded the annual fluoride session at the dentist where I had to sit clamping my teeth together wearing gum shields loaded with a foul tasting gel presented as an appealing 'orange' or 'strawberry'  flavour; I was on the verge of retching throughout the whole procedure which I think lasted around 5 minutes. I also remember at about the same age visiting a great uncle in hospital -he could only croak and whisper and I was told he was in hospital because he had lost his voice. This wasn't a particularly good explanation as he died not long after and I worried about losing my own voice and what this could mean; only many years later did I find out he died of throat cancer. My parents were largely responsible for my health and wellbeing, ensuring I had standard childhood injections (although I recently had a measles vaccination as this seemed to be missing from my early records), check-ups and twice-yearly visits to the dentist. They were also responsible to a large degree for my nutrition (although I resisted all vegetables except potatoes and carrots until I was in my 20s!) and activity levels.  As they both worked full-time, however, I also had other caregivers particularly in my early life -e.g. neighbours, an au-pair and nursery school teachers. These individuals certainly had a strong role to play in making sure I was fed and watered, socially engaging me and taking me out and about (e.g. to parks). Although I recall statements from adults, along the lines of 'eating carrots is good for you' or 'it does you good to stretch your legs' or 'you need to clean your teeth', I don't remember many two-way conversations about health during my childhood. Even at school education seemed to be targeted at very specific issues -namely periods and sexual health and even then delivered in a somewhat obscure manner. The internet did not exist when I was growing up so other sources of information were TV, books and magazines but I can remember very little which was health-related beyond picture books based on topics such as going to the dentist. Key moments I first became aware of bodily changes associated with puberty between the ages of 11 and 12 when my breasts started to develop and thin downy hair started to appear in the pubic area; not long after that my periods started.  I was largely accepting of the developing breasts and pubic hair but less keen on my periods starting.  Although I knew about periods from school (formal education and classmates starting their periods earlier than me), from my mum talking to me and from Judy Blume (who was writing teenage fiction before it was a 'thing') it was still a bit of a shock when I got my first one.  When it started I was waiting to be picked up by a friend and her parents to go to a horse show at Hickstead; I don't know why but I was too embarrassed to tell anyone so thought I could manage with layers of toilet paper in my knickers, which turned out not to be the case. I had a thoroughly unpleasant day making regular visits to the toilets and yet still ending up staining my knickers and light pink jogging bottoms which I managed to cover up until I got home, then disposing of the knickers and washing the trousers. For over a year on a monthly basis I filched tampons from my mum's supply and/or bought my own with my pocket money until I eventually made a wordless declaration that my periods had started by putting some tampons in a shopping trolley whilst out doing the weekly grocery shop with my mum.  For months before that she had asked as we passed the aisle of sanitary products whether I needed anything and I had shaken my head -I don't think I was fooling anybody and to this day I don't know why I couldn't just speak up. I've also never been to a horse show since! Although there were 3 women in the household (me, my sister and my mum) the topic of periods was always somewhat taboo in my father's presence -I remember vividly when we were going away on holiday when my sister and I were in our early teens that my dad had a small space left in his suitcase which my mum duly filled with a large box of tampons for 3; all I need say is that he wouldn't close his suitcase up until the offending items had been removed. My first bra, probably again at around the age of 12, was a size 28AA, which hardly seems worth bothering with. However, other girls at school, many more buxom than I, were sporting bras when getting changed for PE and I think I felt childish still wearing my vest.  Nowadays I'd much rather a vest than a bra, although I do tend to wear a bra when going outside the house, only for it to be removed asap on returning home -bras just feel so restrictive. I have never been particularly hairy and am quite fair, but again reacting to peer pressure I started shaving my legs at around the age of 13. Again not wanting to discuss the matter with my parents I risked if not life then at least limb by using the sharpest object in the house to which I had easy access.  My parents were chiropodists and had a surgery in the house, well-equipped with medical instruments including scalpels. I think the E11 blade was my tool of choice and when nobody was around I would stand in the surgery with one foot resting on the patient's chair and carefully scrape off the hairs, with only a few minor bloody incidents. Around a year later I plucked up the courage to ask for an electric shaver (Ladyshave) for Christmas, although I have to say it missed more hairs than the scalpel. As already mentioned above the only other bodily change I experienced in relation to puberty was acne, although in my case it has returned (although in a much milder form) since I stopped taking the contraceptive pill in my mid 40s and is therefore something I seem to be stuck with for life. Growing older My attempts to actively maintain both physical and mental health over the years have been sporadic. In school, aside from mandatory PE lessons I didn't take much part in physical activities in my school years, with the exception of gymnastics between the ages of 6 and 14 (at school and at a gym club); outside school I was pretty active until my mid teens, spending a lot of time playing outside with my sister and friends -riding bikes, racing each other in the garden, playing 'rounders' with a tennis racket and ball and (a particular favourite of mine) climbing trees. At university I rowed for a year in a half-hearted manner and did a lot of walking in the course of getting to tutorials and visiting college bars; during my 20s I played some badminton and took up swimming, gradually building up to half hour 40-50 length sessions on a fairly regular basis.  The swimming I have continued in a regular but sporadic way -when I'm in the swim, so to speak, I do around 3 half hour sessions a week for several months at a time but these periods are interspersed with hiatuses when I'm not seen at the pool for months. I stopped going in March 2020 when the first Covid lockdown occurred and am looking forward to going back, but not until I have been vaccinated. I am also an occasional cyclist -the tandem my transport of choice as I think my partner does about two-thirds of the work and just pre-lockdown had started attending yoga classes which I was very much enjoying and am hoping will resume some time this year. F4813 Autumn 2020 -Everyday Health and Wellbeing Page 4 of 9 As I write it is the 3rd January and, as is the case with many of us at New Year, am appraising my physical condition -the appraisal is not good; I currently weigh 10st 10lb which according to a BMI calculation based on my height puts me into the overweight category.  I have dug out my 5:2 diet book and will commence fasting (i.e. limiting intake to 500 calories) 2 days a week as of tomorrow when I go back to work.  I have used this diet before and found it good for weight loss, but the older I get the longer it seems to take. My aim is to reduce my weight to 10 stone (ideally 9, but I'm being realistic!) by the end of March.  I also want to be fitter as well as squeezing back into some of the clothes I have temporarily abandoned and am contemplating taking up running using the Couch to 5k download to instruct and guide me, but will have to battle the temptation to stay in bed on dark cold mornings. I am hoping to have had an anti-Covid vaccine by early Summer so I can also return to the pool. With regard to mental health I have in the past tended to get to crisis point before taking active steps to address the issues, be that CBT treatment which I have found reasonably helpful and/or taking anti-depressants to manage anxiety levels. I think I was in my late 30s before I accepted that I needed professional help and asked for it, with some false starts along the way before finding out what helped most.  I have also been much more aware since my 30s of the close link between physical and mental health and the need to take care of both. The internet has made it much easier to source information on health and wellbeing and this is my primary source when I am looking for information, guidance and advice.  One of my roles in the Library Service for which I work is to lead on the Health and Wellbeing aspect of the 'Universal Offers' devised by Libraries Connected which help inform the direction and delivery of public library services.  I have therefore attended training on topics such as health literacy and social prescribing, am signed up to numerous health-related partnership organisations so regularly receive email updates on matters such as mental health/dementia/public health campaigns and work on promoting health and wellbeing to the public through promotion of health books, other health resources, drop-in sessions with partners etc...  This has been an aspect of my work for over 5 years and I'd say has had a strong influence on increasing my awareness on matters of health and wellbeing, including my own. Alongside this there has been a noticeable change in the prioritising of staff health and wellbeing at corporate level within my work organisation, accentuated even further by Covid; the yoga classes I had started attending prior to lockdown were organised corporately to be available during the working day lunchtime period at a reasonable price and a strong emphasis is placed on supporting staff with physical and mental health issues. In some ways I would say I'm less aware of my body now -for example, the significant improvement in my digestive and overall health since a diagnosis of Coeliac disease at 29 means I am not constantly focused on my gut and my bowels.  In other ways I am more aware of my body -for a start there is more of it, having gradually put on around 2 stone in the 20 years since my Coeliac diagnosis.  My weight has crept up and down during the years and my markers for action (i.e. diet and exercise targeted at reducing it) have gradually moved from 9 stone to 9.5 to 10 and now 10.5 (or more accurately 10st 10lb currently!). When I am overweight I become more aware of my body because my clothes become tight and uncomfortable, I notice the sagging stomach in the bathroom mirror and the folds on my back and don't like what I see.  Eventually the discomfort and mild revulsion at what I see provides me with the incentive to act, but as I've said the older I get the harder it is to remedy the situation. Awareness of ageing (I will be 50 this year) is also influencing my awareness of health and wellbeing -I feel I need to act now to get into a routine of healthy eating and exercise both for the present and the years ahead.  My pension age keeps moving further away and I want to ensure that I am fit enough and healthy enough to enjoy the leisure time afforded by retirement when it comes. Time is no longer on my side. Health, wellbeing and appearance I believe that the relation of health and wellbeing to external appearance is limited.  I have learned by experience not to assume that the apparently overweight individual who has just got into the swimming pool will be a worse or slower swimmer than me; I know that just because someone has unsightly acne it doesn't mean that they are an unhealthy human being.  There are however exceptions to the rule -for example, visibly poor dental health is often a sign of broader poor health issues. As a teenager I was influenced to some degree by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance -the posters on my bedroom walls were of men in the public eye that I, amongst thousands of others, held up as desirable physical specimens, be they of the day or timeless classics (for example the deceased actor James Dean, who for some reason was hot stuff in the 1980s along with Marilyn Monroe).  The poster shop Athena was an essential stop-off point if meeting up with friends in the shopping precinct at the weekend where we would flick through stacks of images deciding who we might add to our walls and who might get relegated to make space. With age this pure focus on physical appearance has dimmed and I am just as likely to find someone in the public eye attractive (that attraction being far more abstract than the attraction I felt in my hormonal teenage years) for their wit or intelligence, which isn't to say that there aren't individuals I don't admire only for their physical appearance, sometimes being fully aware that this is all I do admire about them. I think I have been less influenced, however, by ideals of beauty relating to women; I've often found catwalk models, for example, an odd representation of the female form, particularly those who by any medical standard would be classed as underweight, their bony joints and gaunt faces the very opposite of what I would consider to be beautiful. My parents were obsessed with appearance, but rather in the context of social status and presenting a picture of a well-ordered 'nice' family than health and wellbeing or physical ideals. As a family we always had to be 'well-turned out', in particular if we were going anywhere with my father -we couldn't go shopping with him as young children unless we were wearing nice dresses and shoes and my parents spent a lot of money on buying us clothes such as fake fur coats with matching boots. No matter my 'Rupert Bear' checked trousers were insanely itchy -my parents thought they looked smart and that's what counted. Photos and cine film of my childhood show my parents posing in lingering shots for the camera in what they consider to be chic and stylish outfits for the time -in the 1970s for my dad tight-waisted flared trousers, a tight shirt and a silk scarf around his neck held in place with a scarf ring; for my mum a well-fitted tweed jacket, long A-line suede skirt and knee-high heeled sued boots. They have always dressed smartly even when just lounging around at home, to the extent of wearing shoes in the house (high heels in the case of my mother); the only exception to this rule has been wearing of old casual clothing for gardening or decorating. The jogging bottoms I wear when working from home would be anathema to them. I am pretty low maintenance with regard to health and beauty products and aim to use a minimal number and where possible environmentally friendly options (e.g. solid shampoo which is wrapped in recyclable paper, rather than liquid in plastic bottle). My daily routine depends on toothpaste, pine tar body soap, solid shampoo and conditioner, aloe vera gel to moisturize, lip balm and a mineral anti-perspirant. My Desert Island item would probably be the pine tar soap as it can be used for body and hair washing and has antibacterial and insect-repelling properties -practicality outweighs luxury in this choice. Getting ready to leave the house My parents getting ready for work rituals were limited due to early starts in their self-employed role as chiropodists.  Both would have their main wash in the evening -showers for dad and baths for mum -so less needed to be done in the morning.  For dad it would be brushing teeth, washing face, combing hair and on occasions a quick shave (his facial hair growth was limited) -he did not use antiperspirant or deodorant because I believe he saw it as unmanly and believed there was no body odour to mask, which was not the case; he would be up at 6.00am and on the way to his surgery in Tooting by 6.30am in a suit, shirt, bow-tie and polished leather shoes in cooler months (covered by a white coat at work) and a dental-style tunic and trousers outfit in the warmer months.  Mum's morning routine would involve brushing teeth, washing face, using a hot brush to tidy her hair, a dab of antiperspirant and perfume and a quick make-up with foundation and bright lipstick; again she was smartly dressed, usually in a dress and tights covered by a white coat, with white clog-style surgical shoes to match when working from the home surgery and smart shoes (often high heels with straps and buckles) when she was working from the Tooting surgery, at NHS clinics or carrying out domiciliary visits. The white coats and dental-style outfits were changed daily and were always immaculate and well-pressed, the smell of starch from the ironing strong in the home. One thing that neither of them made time for was breakfast, although dad may have drunk half a cup of tea before leaving and mum an orange juice and a black coffee before starting work. In the 1970s when my sister and I were young, my parents went out fairly regularly in the evening for gatherings at friends' houses, meals out on their own or with others, special events such as Ladies' Nights at the Masonic Lodge and occasionally opera and theatre. Their preparations were often quite hurried as they both worked full-time and due to working hours and traffic dad would rarely be home before 7.00pm, although he would try and block out later sessions in the appointment book to be earlier if going out.  My sister and I could be quite clingy with my mum when small so would often sit in my parents' bedroom watching them get ready. Dad would have a quick wash and brush-up and don a smart suit, shirt and bow-tie or black-tie garb if appropriate, combing his hair and giving his shoes a quick rub if not highly polished; as he always wore a 'proper' rather than a ready-tied bow-tie he might spend several minutes in a front of a mirror trying to get it just right. He has always been a worrier, particularly with regard to time-keeping, arriving everywhere with excessive amounts of time to spare; he would always be ready first and pacing up and down the hallway in a restive manner whilst waiting for mum to be ready. Mum's 1970s routine for going out would involve a quick bath if time and if not a wash and brush up at the sink, application of make-up (foundation, powder, eye shadow, mascara and lipstick) and a spray of perfume and dressing glamorously, quite often in long dresses set off with necklace, earrings and a bracelet.  The last thing she would do is paint her nails (hands resting on old newspaper), frustrated that she was in a rush and dad was pacing the hallway so she rarely had time to do more than one coat or to let the varnish dry hard before going out, sometimes having to prise from her flowing skirt the clenched hands of a crying child as she made her way out of the door. My routine for getting ready for work has been pretty constant over time and starts with a shower or wash at the sink (on alternating days) and breakfast -the order depending on whether my partner C or I are using the single household bathroom first or second.  I then brush my teeth, moisturise my face and lips, get dressed and put in some earrings and strap on my watch, put my packed lunch together (either C or I will make sandwiches for the two of us) and tidy round the house if time (e.g. make the bed, take washing out the airing cupboard) before leaving for the office. I virtually never dry my hair with a hairdryer so either tie it back in a scrunched 'bun' or plait whilst wet or use the blowers in the car to partially dry it on the way to work, tidying it up with a brush when I get there.  I also very rarely wear make-up, although on occasions may use a tinted moisturiser to cover blemishes/uneven tones/broken veins on my skin (particularly as I get older).  I have always been happy for people to see me and take me as I am and don't like the feel of make-up on my skin, the stains it can transfer to clothes and the time it takes to apply; aside from that I am an inexpert beautician and generally look like a child who's been at her mother's dressing-table if I spend any length of time on trying to alter (enhance?) my appearance. Work clothes are somewhere between casual and formal -I rarely wear a trouser suit unless interviewing job applicants or attending a conference but instead in winter tend to wear black trousers, a shirt or long-sleeved cotton t-shirt and a jumper or cardigan and black ankle boots.  Summer clothes are usually lighter-coloured trousers and tops or long dresses or skirts and tops with cardigans and sandals.  I find tights uncomfortable and restrictive and only on rare occasions do I wear these with shorter dresses or skirt suits with court shoes or boots. For socialising informally (e.g. meeting friends for tea/lunch/a walk) my routine is much as my getting ready for work routine but with the clothes worn generally more casual in winter (jeans, cords, casual shirts and jumpers, suede lace-up shoes) although similar in summer. For more formal socialising (e.g. weddings and other celebratory events) I spend more time on getting ready and may bath instead of shower and shave my legs; I also dry and style my hair using a hairdryer, apply a little make-up (foundation, eye shadow, eye liner and mascara) and carefully select an outfit which I think suitable for the occasion but which also complements my figure, laying out all the parts -the 'good' underwear, the dreaded tights, the dress, the cardigan, the jewellery (to earrings I will add a necklace, bracelet and smart watch) and where applicable the coat, scarf and gloves. I guess I feel that I'm a little more 'on show', am aware I may be photographed and that I may be compared to other women at the occasion and don't want to be found entirely wanting; to some extent the pressure is on and I become far more aware of my whole demeanour ­how I stand, sit, get up, walk and move around the room -than in day-to-day circumstances. Again there has been no change over time in my routine, but in general as I've got older I've felt a lot less self-conscious about what people might think of what I'm wearing or how I look (in contrast to my teenage years and even early 20s when there was always a lurking fear of being singled out by my peers for ridicule or identified as 'uncool' or an outsider). In mid to late middle age I feel comfortably camouflaged as I go about my business, largely off the radar of potential detractors and impervious (almost) to outside judgement on my appearance. This is female liberation."

Female. Age 66. Married. Weymouth. Retired Civil Servant. Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2. Health means that if it is good you can engage in any activity without any physical problem. Wellbeing means that your mental health is stable & that you are enjoying life in general. Pain free. Relaxed. Unmedicated. Energetic. Healthy. The manageress of a charity shop in which I volunteer. She is very tall, exceedingly slender & athletic. Her whole being exudes health. Her legs are strong & without any fat. Her muscles can virtually be seen through her skin. She glows. I don’t think that my own health has ever been very greatly influenced other than by my upbringing. My parents never had any problems with their health until old age arrived & I think my childhood was influenced by that. I cannot recall them going to see the G.P. for any relatively trivial ailment. In fact I don’t remember Dad ever going until after retirement. So that must have rubbed off on me. I used to avoid the doctors if I possibly could so I think my childhood made me more resilient. My first recollection of health was asking my mum about the no spitting notice on the bus. She explained it was to prevent the spread of TB. I also remember being fascinated by the VD clinic notices which I saw on the back of public toilet doors. I think I must have wanted to know about those too but I cannot remember ever enquiring! Awareness of wellbeing must have started somewhere & in memory it is how I felt when I sat on mum’s lap & listened to Sunday evening radio with her. I am certain that I was never given any health education anywhere & my parents never divulged to me the ‘facts of life’. I was given an approximation of the facts by a neighbourhood friend who was a year older than me. I think I was age @10. The entire adolescent period of my life was one of total embarrassment, fear & shame. When I got my first period my mum seemed to be very cross with me. I wanted a bra because my friend’s were wearing them but I couldn’t bring myself to ask for one. I was given a second hand one by one of my mum’s friends. When I was 17, at work but living at home I fell pregnant & I had an abortion. My parents must surely have known but nothing was ever said. I was so unhappy for so many years but I know my parents loved me. I really don’t understand why my parents were so reticent. I had an older brother but we never ever discussed anything of this nature as a family or as siblings. My parents were heavily involved in voluntary social work for the probation service & also for the National Marriage Guidance Council. As a young teenager I was used as a model for a photo used in a big poster erected in the cathedral in my childhood city advertising the services like sex education available with the MGC. My dad posed as the model for the counsellor. How ironic! I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2011. My great love for many, many years had been walking. We had moved to North Wales 12 years earlier to be closer to Snowdonia. So M.S. eventually put paid to that activity. I used to go to exercise classes for M.S. patients in Wales & then from 2013 in Weymouth when we moved here. I gave that up a couple of years ago. It was a long way to go on my mobility scooter & very expensive by taxi. We have no car & I cannot get on buses unaided. Then I used to do a small number of exercises at home every day. This has now been whittled down to three days a week whilst my boiled egg lunch is cooking! I look on the NHS website if I think I need information. I don’t read any of the M.S. literature, my head is firmly stuck in the sand! As I have stage 2 degenerative M.S. I know that the chances of my getting worse are almost certain. I try not to think about it at all. It is difficult for me to separate appearance from health & wellbeing. I know this is wrong both morally & in reality. For example the homeless often have gorgeous suntanned skin & can look the absolute picture of health. I couldn’t imagine being without my daily antidepressant tablet. A lifetime supply would have to be my Desert Island luxury. If that was refused then I would request a cyanide suicide capsule. My parents were always well groomed. Dad in particular was very fond of his clothes & very much the dandy. Cravats etc. Unduly influenced by Noel Coward. Mum tried but had less confidence & style. I used to get fully made up when I went out & always wore mascara every day. I don’t even own a single item of cosmetics now. I simply rely wholly on my natural beauty. Oh & I studiously ignore mirrors & reflective surfaces."

Female. Age 66. Married. Weymouth. Retired Civil Servant. Spring Directive 2020 Part 2. COVID 19 (update). My household of two, this being me & my husband, have not suffered from any health issues of any kind during lockdown, thankfully. I have felt happier than usual although I do worry about the pandemic & also about the terrible racial tension in the U.S.A. I have been content to stay at home, the only thing that I miss is the library. I feel so sorry for the Government. I am sure that they have all been trying desperately to make the wisest decisions but what a maelstrom of advice they have had to wade through. I have never at any time doubted that they all have everyone’s best interests in mind but they cannot help or please everyone all the time. In coming months I expect the restrictions will become more relaxed, more use of face masks to be advised plus a lot more financial responsibility & restrictions to be handed to local government. If social distancing is to be adhered to perhaps they will restrict travel to stop the recent crowding at beaches & beauty spots. I wish they would bring in a mileage limit so people stay in their own areas either by local council boundaries or geographical counties. For the first time in years I have watched some T.V. news, although very little. I always look at teletext news for the U.K. but have also been looking at the world news. I have only seen bits of the daily 5pm updates. I did watch Boris deliver the last of his lockdown changes. I thought he was clear & quite impressive. I don’t think anyone else could have done much better. Oh I definitely think there should be BSL interpreter plus available subtitles on every news broadcast. Absolutely no reason why not. My home life has improved because I have M.S. & I haven’t had to force myself to go anywhere because I think I should. I usually volunteer at a charity shop two mornings a week & very often I only went out of a sense of duty no matter how I was feeling. I am more than happy at home with my solitary pastimes of reading & puzzles. Also my husband is usually out three days a week plus away from home once a month for a 2 or 3 night break. He cannot do this & so I never have to worry about his absences. I usually only keep in touch with two people by ‘phone, I have never wanted to have Skype or FaceTime. All the rest of my friends I correspond with by email or in 2 instances by post. I don’t use any social media. I have been keeping in touch with 3 of my friends from the charity shop by phone but I wouldn’t mind if that stopped really. I stammer badly so the phone can be an ordeal. I have not had any real food problems. I have had fortnightly supermarket deliveries as I had before lockdown. Some things have been hard to get but I have muddled along well. So nothing has changed radically. Every day I spend@ an hour on my cryptic crosswords a little longer on jigsaws. I was buying & selling jigsaws on EBay, usually I buy them from my charity shop. A few weeks ago my shop manager delivered a big bag of jigsaws from the shop for me. They are going to keep me going for months! My reading matter, once I had finished my library books, has been lent to me by my sister in law who has a vast number of books. So no shortage on that score either. Maybe the jigsaws & books haven’t all been what I would have picked out but I am sure the variety is beneficial! I watch many films & some drama series, during lockdown my favourite shows have been The Great British Sewing Bee, Grayson Perry’s Art Club & Keith Lemon’s Craft Factory. I listen to Radio 2 & some Radio 4. The only thing that has changed in my personal hygiene is that my short hair is in dire need of a cut! I am sorely tempted to cut my fringe myself! Luckily I had a very, very brutally short haircut at the beginning of March so it hasn’t been too horrendous for too long plus no-one sees me anyway apart from my husband & he stopped looking at me many years ago! I am a brilliant sleeper! For example yesterday I had 50 minutes after lunch, 20 minutes after dinner, bed at 10.30 where I slept soundly until 7.30! The only thing that has changed a little bit is I have had a couple of nightmares about the pandemic & have once or twice thought that I was ill with it in the night. A sort of half awake dream but all was normal in the morning. Well normal for me! I haven’t been told of any severe cases of insomnia by my friends."

The only disruptions I have ‘suffered’ are all very minor. These are, my two mornings weekly volunteering in a charity shop stopped until last week. I expected to miss it but I didn’t. However now that I am back I am enjoying it as much as ever. Neither more nor less. I also stopped my weekly cafe sandwich type lunch with my husband. I also went with him for a coffee/tea most afternoons or for an ice cream & a sit on the prom in good weather. I could resume these outings but haven’t yet wanted to. My husband goes out with or without me! So I have definitely spent an awfully big amount of time at home as a result.  My extra hours at home have simply flown by in all weathers. I have extended the time I spend on crossword puzzles, jigsaws & reading. At first I was having to buy jigsaws from EBay because my charity shop is my usual source which of course was closed. So I sold the puzzles I had completed to pay for some others! My nice shop manager then brought me a massive bag of puzzles on loan from the shop for the duration so I was lucky. I really missed the library & once I had read their books I had on loan before lockdown I was so fortunate to have a literary hoarder for a sister in law! She kept me supplied throughout! The library here is now operating a system of allowing us to borrow again which is wonderful. They select ten books on selected genres then I collect them at my appointed time. This is a great idea, I am reading books which I would previously never considered. Mostly, I now realise, because of their covers. So now I wonder if all library books had plain covers would their lending rates rise or fall?  I have not been out really but I have spent a small amount of my afternoons sitting in the garden. I have really appreciated the flowers, birds & butterflies. Especially in the early weeks of lockdown when there was virtually no road traffic noise.   My home life is very much as before. I have M.S. so I am quite accustomed to amusing myself & staying home alone. My husband uses a spare room for his computer whilst I am downstairs with my puzzles, my books & T.V. He has been out every day but has only been away overnight once due to lockdown. Usually in summer he is away for a few nights every month. He had tickets for music festivals which were cancelled but he was very philosophical & cheerful although I know he was very disappointed.   The online grocery shopping was a struggle at first when everyone was panic buying. I will never understand the egg shortage. I have had my groceries delivered for several years & the only change for me was that I booked a regular guaranteed fortnightly slot for a year. Also my husband has been bringing lots more food shopping which is great for me as my online order is much smaller & hence less of a major chore.  As a household we have definitely saved a lot of money due to cafe & coffee shop closures. My husband has never had so much money which is as a result of the pub closures (tee hee). Also his train tickets & hotel bills have been dramatically reduced.   I haven’t queued at all but since going back to my charity shop I have seen the queues for McDonald’s & for TK Max. I am amazed that people bother, neither establishment is exactly necessary! And in the lovely weather too! My appointment with the optician was delayed by 5 months but it was no problem. My dental appointment has been moved to October from August (yippee!). My hearing test was cancelled & has yet to be rearranged which is only really a niggle. My sister in law cut my hair! She is in her 70’s & has very poor eyesight! She was waiting for her new stronger specs at the time! She used electric clippers on the longest setting! I resemble a superannuated coconut! This was over 3 weeks ago & it still hasn’t grown at all. Frozen with fear! But can you imagine how much I have saved on shampoo? Yes! Enough for a balaclava!"

It’s hard to quantify but for me being healthy has been not having a sore throat as that’s something I can’t deal with but I don’t care about having a cough. Maybe not being on any medication, I mean a lot of people have to but surely you can’t say they’re 100% healthy in that case as they need outside help to maintain their health What does “wellbeing” mean to you? -It’s a tricky one idk really, feeling good about yourself, more of a mental thing than health which is physical. It just seems like a more flowery way to describe health as some people who have health conditions don’t like using health so health seems more quantifiable whereas wellbeing you could say is more on a sliding scale? Honestly this isn’t a topic which interests me a huge amount What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. -Fit -Unblemished -Reliable -Conformity -Lean Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. -I’m definitely not drawing haha, but maybe just someone who is fairly fit and looks after themselves. Within a healthy weight range because I can never get onboard with calling a fat person healthy because they’re fat and this stops their body performing at its potential and can actually cause health problems so how is this healthy or something to be proud of? I’d just say someone who maintains a good level of fitness to be active and finds being active fairly easy and their body can recover quickly, maybe like a part-time athlete I guess but it doesn’t have to be that extreme either How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? -I’ve always wanted to be fitted and healthier, I’d love for girls to find me aesthetically pleasing but not ripped, just having a pleasing body and that’s maybe a guy thing, especially in Europe where gyms and stuff seem a lot more ‘normal’ than maybe in Asia or America. And being asexual that maybe makes it hard as I don’t find athletes super attractive because of their body or anything like that, it’s the same for my preferences like I want someone who isn’t super fat, but also if they’re a healthy weight and fairly active it’s cool Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? -Hmm maybe but I don’t think so, at times I’ve wanted to be a lot fitter but sometimes I don’t feel like my body is really capable of it so I haven’t wanted to be a regular gym goer because it doesn’t give me enough satisfaction for the time its worth and generally I don’t feel I’ll be attracted to be people more if they regularly work out. I’d love to have a mini six pack or something like that, but more for looks over health just to show that I am fairly healthy and look after myself When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? -Probably when I was young and I guess from my parents but I don’t remember too much, also in the playground at school when someone can run faster or go longer than you, you realised they were probably fitter and therefore healthier? Also food, because we are told certain food is healthy so I guess that’s an early experience of it too. But wellbeing is just maybe a more grown up word so when I was a teenager and it seems more personal looking after yourself Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? -My mum especially, but I always felt that I was naturally healthy as I did kickboxing once a week which helped to maintain some level of fitness and I always ate fruit and never huge meals so I was brought up to be fairly healthy and have takeaway food as a treat so that’s how it started I guess Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? -I guess it depends what you mean about health because my mum always made sure I cleaned my teeth twice a day and I guess that’s part of health. But it was never really a big topic, we’ve never been regimental about health and it’s something which has come more naturally than something which we sit down and talk about, like there are more important things to talk about and also if you feel good, that’s the most important thing really Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? -I think maybe we did in PSHCE lessons which is like personal and social health but I didn’t care so much for it as it felt like something we had to learn instead of something people wanted to know about. But only when discussing sports we’d talk about health I guess, who was the fittest, strongest, more flexible and things like that. But I never took any time to read up about any extra health things like finding out about superfoods and the like. I don’t care so much about it really As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? -Maybe when I was 12 or 13? It’s hard to remember since I’m asexual I didn’t care for it a lot but I know that I first masturbated when I was 13 so that was a big change and I had no idea what was happening actually and I slowly worked it out over the next few years and then I think it became a regular thing I did from maybe the age of 17/18 or so. But I know boys at school would talk about puberty and changes but again I didn’t really engage a lot in the conversations or take much notice Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? -I think the moments seem to be a lot more important for women than for men, like having a period seems like a really big deal but voice breaking, although universal, doesn’t really matter tbh as some people will always have naturally higher or lower voices. I remember first shaving and I hated it lol, what a pain! It’s still a pain now haha, but that’s just one of the things in life and you’d think someone would’ve created something to make it a whole lot easier by now How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? -It was just annoying having to shave aha, but to be honest I didn’t really like it when my voice broke since I don’t like my voice and many people don’t anyway so it’s quite a normal thing. I guess we feel it’s part of growing up and it becomes a much bigger deal at the time as you can compare it to friends or other people’s experiences but looking back on it, it’s not the most exciting thing Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? -When I was younger I did kickboxing, then golf and while I was doing that I also went to after school sports clubs but only for fun and not seriously as I wasn’t good enough to be in teams for these things. I guess I feel like I should take good care of my health to preserve a long and happy life and also so I am attractive to girls and maintain a good body image even for job interviews and things like that. I also think I’m in control of my body more for example I know if I want to eat junk food a lot I need to do good exercise. Mentally, not sure there is much people can do in 2020 apart from not watching the news and not obeying the government and just getting on with your normal life as much as you can Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? -To be honest, I don’t. it isn’t really a big concern of mine and health isn’t something which particularly changes a lot Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? -Definitely more now since I’ve gotten into my 20’s I want to maintain a good image and a solid body and level of fitness as partially I feel like my body deserves it and I know it can be important as looks are still important despite a stigma to move away from that Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? -I think it’ll remain broadly the same for the next 10-20 years or so unless life changes very significantly. They’ll probably be more technology to control it and that’s not always a good thing, technology can help people with health and wellbeing but it shouldn’t take over. I think there’s a broad agreement that people should take good care of their bodies as it relieves pressure on healthcare, we have less problems generally In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? -Massively so but this is reducing at the moment. I’m not sure if I agree that it’s good to reduce it as a fat body shouldn’t be a healthy body as I don’t think we should push to those ideals but some people are naturally fatter or thinner and that should just be understood and appreciated more. I would probably say I was less healthy if I had a fatter stomach because that’s not the general sign of a healthy person and broadly it should remain that way Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? -Maybe a little bit, but these popular ideals haven’t changed a lot and people know that to feel better in themselves generally they should be fit and healthy. Some muscles are good but people should not be overly influenced by huge muscles or a ripped body as for many people it’s not very achievable or realistic Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? -Not a whole lot but my dad will always shave every few days as I think he believes that’s how everyone should still look in terms of professionalism and it looks bad if you have facial hair but nowadays that’s widely accepted as fashion and employers don’t think you’re scruffy or unprofessional if you have facial hair and I like this change…we need to stop appearances correlating to how well you can do a job as this is totally false Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? -Probably not really haha, maybe eczema cream when I was younger but I’d probably take a shaver although if there is no electric socket to charge it, it would be pointless! So idk really, maybe just a sponge Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? -Not particularly different to normal really, obviously my dad would shave but it’s not something which would be different to a regular day, nothing special and just combing or washing hair, brushing teeth etc. There’s nothing so special about it and I wouldn’t say it’s a ritual as such What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? -Nowadays maybe I’d remember to put some deodorant on haha, but yeah again nothing different to if I was just having a lazy day at home. Have a shower, brush my teeth, put on some regular clothes and I shave maybe once every two weeks now but that doesn’t change depending on whether I’m working, socialising or anything in between"

I’m angry at the complacency of the government but not surprised at all and I really hope some of those who voted for them are heavily affected as it will hopefully make some of them think twice about their decisions at the next election, but some people would vote Conservative even if they were made homeless as they would think any other government would somehow put them in a worse position which would almost not even be possible. I’m worried more about dad’s job security than anything and if any good news comes from this I’ll definitely feel some relief and it’ll make me feel a lot more free in my life and emotions if this is the case. I do feel some fear too, fear of our freedoms slowly being taken away and a much longer road to them being recovered – I think it could even be unlikely that some freedoms are not restored within the next 10 years unless protests are in place to help restore them. People power is more important than ever and we cannot let governments control our lives to such a big extent. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? -Everything will be mainly driven by money – it’s a big debate between money and keeping the people on side, but people like money so this is a lot easier than it may seem! If the 14 day quarantine measures for travellers are strictly implemented, it will absolutely crush the airline, tourism and summer job industry to a level not seen before so I do wonder if many other stipulations could come in or it could be amended or loosened to allow some type of tourists in. I think furlough will be increased but reduced, which makes absolutely no sense as for some people it’ll then make more sense to quit their job and try to find one on full pay instead of trying to survive on less income and holding out for better times which may never come as the furlough money could be extended and reduced and then finally the person loses their job which would be such a horrible, but typically capitalist situation to end up in. Figures could also be easily adjusted to fit whatever narrative the government wants as they are almost in control of the ONS and they can choose for them to publish a certain amount of deaths as there’s no way of the public researching about every single death which has taken place. Again, more of this can be found in the other directive so I don’t really want to repeat too much of it. Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. -I haven’t been watching any briefings, in fact as a family we did not watch Johnson’s address on 10th May as we kinda knew what was being said and it’s the same for the daily briefings. They’re quite pointless as little is gained from them every day and the ministers read off a sheet and are woefully underprepared aside from that. It’s a lot easier just to read the breaking news flashes and to get the news that way as it’s more concise and you don’t have to hear the ministers justifying what’s been going on or their plans which many won’t even be implemented so overall it’s a really hard sell. The older generation are from a time where politicians should be trusted and these regular broadcasts appeal to them a lot more than younger people I would say. I’ve just been getting my news via social media and online news articles and it seems the easiest way to get concise information and also you can find out things about other countries as it’s not often reported on national news as they want to avoid comparisons as they know how badly the UK is doing and they really don’t want to highlight this. Whenever figures from other countries decrease, they never report this and they are always looking to sensationalise the bad things instead of talking about recoveries and falling numbers from elsewhere and the methods they have taken in order to get to that positive stage. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? -Absolutely, we should follow Scotland’s lead! But this has been the case from the start, Sturgeon has shown great leadership throughout and little gestures like this go a long way to help some of the most marginalised in society feel part of a big community and not left out. It’s very much the same for autistic people who for many, staying inside for such a long time is crippling for them and their families and these people are often overlooked and it’s so sad to see that those who cannot fit into every generic box, get hit hardest of all. But no one I know has experienced any struggles gaining access to news, my gran gets newspapers delivered every day so this helps and she also has a tv and she’s been exploring some other channels in this period too. Audio description and sign language is a great way of making it more accessible and maybe some extra braille supplements in newspapers or magazines would also help to make it easier for everyone. Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. -Personally I am a student so I haven’t been affected financially or within the workplace during the lockdown. Uni has been very accommodating and this is the case for many unis across the country with a no detriment policy which is a really sensible thing to do and something I’m very much in support of. However it can affect your productivity as you only have to pass in order to get a respectable mark and scoring a high mark is very hard in this period due to lack of resources and the fact that everyone is very out of sync with normal life. But I believe the only reason unis have done this is in order to stop people asking for money back since we pay so much for our tuition. If fees were lower as in the rest of Europe, then this policy would probably not exist as it doesn’t exist abroad. If people are still getting a good degree they’re much less likely to want their money back but if you’re taking people’s money and failing them, then we could see the collapse of unis as institutions very quickly. The only way they can survive is with money and they can only have money if people are getting what they want from them, problem solved. Concentrating on uni work has been a lot harder during this period though but I’m trying to do work little and often and hoping this is the best way to manage it and to get ahead of deadlines which I’m used to doing anyway. -Dad however has been furloughed but he wishes he could still work, not so much for the money right now but because of the fact he is bored and isn’t used to not working. Job security is worrying though as furlough will stop at some stage and companies will not be able to afford and have the demand to bring all workers back at this stage so equally it is a worrying time. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? -Actually this isn’t a topic which I can’t write so much about since I don’t have children myself and relationships haven’t changed a whole lot. Dad has struggled a lot not being at work and he has been irritable at times but that’s about it really, mum has also struggled being inside at times and not seeing her mum as often as normal. But we’ve just tried to stay busy and in a routine which has helped to mitigate some of the factors. Although I do think that mum and dad have been able to spend more time together than over the last 25 years or so which seems pretty crazy but even them going for walks together has been really nice for them both I think. Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? -I was pretty familiar with these technologies before the lockdown so it hasn’t been much of a change, whatsapp especially since we all use it to communicate in our family anyway and that hasn’t changed, plus it’s the best way to speak to people in different countries so I’ve been very used to using it before. I haven’t used house party as I don’t really have enough friends for that! Plus most of my friends are individual and not in a group so this doesn’t really work in this case, plus I’ve seen a lot of stories about it being hacked and taking people’s details so I’m glad I avoided it and I’m not really into that kinda thing anyway…it seems to be something which is for the popular people and those who enjoy parties and pub quizzes. I’ve tried my best to video chat with friends during this period but some people prefer doing it to others, some like messaging and others don’t really like it at all so its been a mixed experience with everything. I’m not a huge fan of video chatting anyway as I really enjoy speaking on messages more but it’s better than nothing so I’ve done it now and again. Uni used Zoom in order to do our online classes and it is a really good platform, don’t we all wish we brought some shares in it a few months ago! Some tutors have been a little uncomfortable using it and I really feel for them as there’s a lot of pressure on them to adjust really quickly to something totally new and my tutors have honestly done a great job with it so I’m pleased for them and hopefully they have felt happy too. I don’t think online classes can be the future though, it’s a very different experience and not at all worth the money which we pay for it. If they do decide to have some degrees online from September, I guarantee that many students will defer or pull out and this will have huge implications for the uni industry, renting industry and job industry! I don’t think people understand student power and how important it can be. If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? -This has really depended on the person in question…I have tried to re-connect with people who have drifted away from me by messaging them and checking in on them to show that I care and sometimes this has proven successful, but overall it sadly hasn’t and I’ve really found this hard as I thought it would be the perfect time to reconnect and most people have told me that this has been the case which has frustrated me more as I haven’t been able to pull it off. I’ve always struggled socially and this felt like my opportunity to put it right but sadly it hasn’t been the case but there are still some positives to take away and these are important for me. It hasn’t been a pressure at all as I enjoy talking online and I’ve really tried to grasp that but its hard if I have friends who I want to stay close to but they don’t like speaking online as this is just a terrible situation, especially if these people are still living with other friends or are breaking rules and seeing them during this period while I’m at home not seeing anyone. I do worry about a lot of my international friends since they’re lockdown restrictions are getting relaxed so it means they can see friends a lot sooner than me and I definitely worry about being left behind…just as I was starting to make some real social progress too which is the sad thing as I don’t want that progress to be lost. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? -I’m on social media a lot in general and I would say my use of social media has been relatively the same over this period, maybe a little more on Twitter but really not a whole lot much. I think it’s the best place to check in with news instead of news channels though as it can only be short and concise on twitter and that’s all you really want to know about it. It’s definitely very hard to escape from things and social media doesn’t really let you do that as there’s always some type of Corona post around the corner, whether it be good or bad and that’s just a part of life now. I don’t use Facebook a whole lot anyway, maybe just check it once or twice a day and that’s really it and I don’t think it’s a good place for news as people are on it more than other social media so it’s a lot easier to spread fake news and for people to be angry with the comments in this case and it’s quite a toxic social media nowadays. Twitter is sadly becoming like that too but it’s still a good place for news and to try to judge public opinion although that’s very hard since I think in general there’s more left-wing than right-wing people on twitter and that definitely doesn’t reflect society in general sadly. And year Instagram is fine, like I enjoy it to see what’s going on in people’s lives and you also get a good sense over who’s breaking the rules by seeing the posts on there and who people are with and it’s always a place to go which can then make you feel jealous about other people’s lives but that’s also the way it has always been. What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? -My parents have done the food shopping during this period but previously I would go with my gran each week and help her but we have limited the number of people going to the shops so it can be done efficiently and as safely as possible. At first, many key items such as pasta and rice were missing but these have slowly been replenished. Some things such as eggs and flour still have a shortage and although this is the case, it’s frustrating that the item limit is still kept in place as there is no real reason for it and no end in sight as to when it might be removed which again worries me about other restrictions which will be put in place over the coming weeks and month. My parents have usually chosen times when they do not believe there will be large queues at the shops, such as early morning or in the evening to prevent waiting times but sometimes this can be hard as its hard to know when the shops will be at their busiest. Sometimes people in the shops have not been respectful, other customers and not staff, and there’s nothing you can do about this and if people are not going to keep distance, its just tough really and this will continue in many different places for months to come. Ideally, we would’ve wanted to do the shopping online but my dad doesn’t quite qualify for the most at risk category so this hasn’t been possible sadly and does increase the risk by going to the shop. We tried to book some slots by keep looking on the websites and we could’ve got one Ocado slot a few weeks ago but it was right after they went shopping so there wasn’t much point and now they’ve kinda given up with that since stocks are higher and queues are generally lower. The idea of giving slots to the most ill and vulnerable is a good idea but it doesn’t always work since the most vulnerable are usually the ones with no connection to the internet to be able to do this and not all of them have family who can help out or do the shopping for them. There was a big market to employ more people to pick food and deliver it to a larger range of the population but this didn’t happen quite to the extent I think it could’ve done. Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? -I don’t really cook personally so my cooking habits have remained minimal and unchanged! But we’ve definitely changed as a household, mainly actually because everyone is at home so everyone can eat at the same time and therefore everyone can have the same meal. This has been half a conscious decision to save money but also because of circumstances. We’ve eaten a lot more meat based products as we have tried to buy cheap, large quantities and divide it out for different meals e.g. making meatballs or mince for a homemade lasagne. We always had a lot of homemade meals but I think that has increased over this period, especially as ready meals are just a little more expensive and the fact there’s less choice over them at the moment too, since a lot more people are buying them. I’ve also had to drink less milk due to the quantity limits in shops as we haven’t gone shopping as often and therefore cannot buy as much milk and instead I’ve had to have some fruit squash to subsidise for the lack of milk, although due to having eczema flared up by fruit, this isn’t ideal but hasn’t actually affected it too much in this period luckily. We did buy a lot of food pre-lockdown so we’ve slowly used this up over the period and it was definitely a big help to stock up on food beforehand as it meant that we didn’t have to go out as often in the more difficult periods and our outgoings reduced as our income did as well. We’ve continued to make homemade cakes, bread and other things in this period which has been super nice and it’s another thing for my mum and sister to spend time on and that’s always a good thing right now too. But personally, my eating times and what I’ve eaten hasn’t changed a whole lot. We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? -I haven’t really taken up any new hobbies since a lot of my time has been spent working on uni stuff or having/preparing for online classes so right now there hasn’t been so much change in my life compared to normal which has probably allowed me to cope a lot better than some people, especially on a personal level. Routine has been key to all of this and to entertaining myself actually since I have had a fairly set routine which has included a 5km walk at the start of each day and this is an increase from any exercise I would do when I’m just at home, but if I was going to uni for example I’d probably walk around 6km/7km a day anyway so compared to this its kinda similar really. We’ve also been playing board games which we enjoyed doing before anyway but now we’ve been able to play more of them and more often which has been nice and also we’ve had a mini pool table we’ve been able to put on the patio outside so I guess playing this to a higher standard has been one new skill I’ve learnt but we did do this occasionally in previous summers. I’ve also tried to become a more skilled video gamer playing Gran Turismo Sport as in the official championship last year I was top-15 in UK but since I don’t put in hours a day like some people, I was hoping to match that again this year with a lot less practice than most people. Dad has done a lot of DIY jobs and house maintenance so all of this is now up to date instead of being staggered throughout the year but it isn’t something which I do myself. There are also lots of repeats of tv shows on at the moment and some I enjoy watching if I haven’t seen them since my childhood but dad will watch shows and films over and over again and he almost pretends he’s never seen them before which really isn’t something I can do at all. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. - I’m not a particularly big listener of anything really, including music, so I haven’t been  listening to anything new or different in this period. Sometimes I play pop music while  playing video games to relax me but that’s about it and I’ve also never read an audio book  before!  - Reading wise, it’s been mainly academic stuff related to my Masters dissertation and this has  meant that I haven’t had the chance to read anything for pleasure and that is the problem  with being a student at times as you don’t really have as much desire to read for pleasure  when you’re reading academic articles most days.  - I have been watching a lot of new tv series during this period as tv series aren’t something  which I watch as much as most other people of my age but I have very much enjoyed getting  into them, albeit on illegal websites. I firstly watched “You” which I enjoyed although maybe  it didn’t quite live up to expectations. And then I watched “Project Blue Book” which is very  much my type of show about conspiracies etc but again I was slightly underwhelmed and  now I’m watching “Mindhunter” which is different again being a crime show but I’m maybe  enjoying this one more than the other series. All of these have been recommendations by  friends since I also want to be able to speak to people about the shows I’m watching as my  taste in series is very different to my parents really.  Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? -Yes it has actually, I am still having a shower and washing my hair once a day in the morning and that hasn’t changed but I am shaving less and its probably a habit which I will carry forward into the future. I wasn’t that bothered about not shaving before but I just built it into a weekly routine and now that its hard to maintain a routine, I’ve just shaved when I wanted to as a result and I don’t feel any better or worse about it, I just think it something I’d prefer not to do and therefore I’ve just done it less. The whole idea of needing to be clean shaven in order to be presentable is very old fashioned now anyway despite some people still thinking it’s a requirement of jobs when this in fact has long gone. It’s more fashionable and possibly even more desirable to have stubble or some form of a beard anyway. Of course my hair is growing since I’ve been unable to get it cut but we ordered some hair clippers and a shaver so dad’s can be cut as he doesn’t like it getting long at all whereas I’m a little less worried about it and I got my hair cut before lockdown anyway so it hasn’t got to a critical level yet! We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. -I’ve heard a lot of stories about people having weird and wonderful dreams and it’s definitely been the same here too. My sleeping has been pretty good until the start of May but that’s mainly been due to the fact it’s so light in the morning and not other factors. Keeping in a sleeping routine has been important since then your sleeping pattern isn’t disturbed and I’ve never been someone who can stay up super late anyway so in all honesty it hasn’t affected me so much and I think the same can be said for my mum and sister. Dad has been getting up early as he finds it hard to sleep a lot and he’d rather be doing things instead of sleeping which is understandable, but sometimes he’ll stay up late to watch films and I think this can mess with the sleeping patterns too. -In terms of dreams, I have had some nightmares but they’ve been aeroplane ones which are very common for me, so common I have a log with how often I have them and it’s often a couple of times a month and this has been unchanged. The planes usually crash and fall out of the sky with me on the ground looking on helplessly. The two most vivid dreams I have had have both been about crushes of some sort – the first featured online friend LS who I rarely speak to but I very much enjoy it when we do speak and at this point I had not spoken to her for maybe a month or more which is why it was extremely random. It was almost as if we were married and she was in her wedding dress and we were going to a quiz night at uni and it was about motorsport which is a common topic of ours and when I woke up from the dream it prompted me to message her and she replied and said how nice it was to hear from me so I wonder if it was trying to tell me, or even her, something. My other vivid dream was about famous racing driver SF who I have had a connection with in the past, almost at a friendly type level 5 years ago which seems absolutely crazy looking back at things now. But the dreams were twofold, one at a racetrack and we were spectating together which I guess was kinda normal and standard and then another with her in my room and we were just cuddling and chilling out and it reminded me of good times we spent together, obviously not at all intimate and this came on the five year anniversary of a really special day in both of our lives so dreams seem to have a lot more meaning in this period which is interesting."

A healthy body: Lean Slim Muscular Fit Serene I would consider Joe Wicks to be a healthy person. He keeps fit, eats healthily, looks quite toned and works on his mental well-being too. Growing up and learning about health As a child, my parents took responsibility for my health. They were the ones who helped me when I was ill and were the ones who limited my chocolate and sweet intake. Even though I was quite slim, my mum would always go on about watching my weight but not necessarily because it was unhealthy. If I went to have more of something that wasn’t good for me, I was told to either try and stay the same weight or I would never meet anyone if I put weight on. I remember being classed as quite underweight, at one point, and it was only my dad who actually commented on it and was worried. When I was older, I would eventually discuss this with my mum and to ask to stop mentioning my weight. Although, I do enjoy food and have eaten a lot during lockdown, I do think that influence has led me to be very controlling over my food intake especially when it comes to snacks. I also knew that my parents had both been smokers and had given up for health reasons just before I was born and when we went out would now hate to go to places where people were allowed to smoke. Key Moments I first started to become aware of what changes would happen during puberty when I was around 9. My mum bought me abook about periods and although, I don’t think what was in the book was ever really discussed with me, I was shown a drawer which had B3635 sanitary products in if I ever needed them. It was at school when I was actually told what would happen and even then it was still a bit of a surprise to me. I think for a girl starting her periods and buying a bra are definitely important moments in her life. I remember buying my first bra from Tammy Girl and feeling mortified. I was just very embarrassed by the whole thing. I asked for crop tops initially so that I didn’t have to have bra straps showing through my clothing. It would be a while longer before I would actually wear bras. When my periods started I was 13 and it was the first day of the summer holidays, I stayed in all day and cried. When I look back, I didn’t want these changes to my body because it meant Iwasgrowing up and I was scared too. I wanted to stay being a child because for me it symbolised safety. Growing Older I was a primary school teacher for 13 years which involved taking my class for p.e lessons, carrying lots of books and walking everywhere. I think that definitely helped me to keep fit. I also went to weekly zumba classes which I did not just because it was a form of exercise but because I really enjoyed it. However, over the last few years this has changed which was mainly due to having a child. I left my job to look after her so I wasn’t taking p.e lessons or going to zumba anymore. I do still walk everywhere though but haven’t lost all the weight I put on from having my daughter. I’m definitely more aware of my body now which I think has mainly come from the extra weight I have. It’s only ¾ of a stone but it’s made me look at my body more and I can see a rounder tummy and stretch marks as well as lines around my eyes. I’d really like to get back to my target weight which will involve cutting back on the extra snacks I’veeaten over lockdown and I’d really like to do something like yoga or pilates too which might help me lose weight but also maybe help the bits of my body that ache. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think that health can be related to external appearance in regards to size. If you see someone who is overweight then you might think that they have got this way through overeating and because of that they’re unhealthy whereas if you see someone who is slim then you might assume that they eat healthily and exercise. When I was still at school, I remember listing all the plastic surgery I wanted to have when Iwasolder. It included a smaller nose and bigger breasts which I’m pretty sure was influenced by filmand pop stars of the 1990s.  I’m now 45 and never had any surgery. Although, I still talked about it, I think maybe I just stopped reading those magazines which promoted it and let it go. I would now love to have my lines vanish. I’m B3635 not sure if anyone likes to see the first signs of aging especially when some of your friends look a lot younger than you. If I went to a desert island, apart from my contact lenses, I would want my moisturiser and foundation. I had acne when I was younger and covered it with foundation but unfortunately this led to more spots which I've never quite got rid. It has led to me putting it on whenever I go out as I don’t want people to see what my skin is really like. Getting ready to leave the house I have to admit I don’tremember my parents going out but for me, it used to be, shower, get dressed (outfit picked out in advance) and then putting on make-up whilst listening to music. It’s completely changed recently and now consists of the same as above but at a much faster pace and normally with a two year old running around too. It’s not asrelaxed as it usedto be."

It suggested taking steps to keep myself in reasonably good physical condition through attention to diet and exercise. Unfortunately, COVID has challenged the health of very many of us with underlying conditions. Wellbeing is centred on mental aspects of the human condition, some of which can be influenced by others, particularly in online situations. I would suggest that the wellbeing of teenagers and young people gives most concern to adults. Teenagers may become acutely anxious, can be subject to torrid abuse from those they interact with online and are driven to self-harm (or worse).  A healthy body – slim, fit, exercise, supple, diet An image that comes to mind??  Maybe the actor and political activist Jane Fonda – a woman in her eighties who personifies ‘healthy body’ attributes and maintains a strong sense of purpose in her life. Identity My experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by a number of factors.  As a direct result of being close to a young person who was an alcoholic, I have been very careful about the amount I drink and now rarely drink at all. I’ve also been influenced by socially driven ‘causes’. For example, in the 1980s I was influenced by national concerns about reducing our fat intake.  We, as a household, started drinking skimmed milk, using low-fat spreads in place of butter and so on.  This was the perceived wisdom at the time, though it has more recently been challenged and changed. I’m also very aware of inherited health risks (specifically, glaucoma and heart disease) and take care to keep these monitored. Perhaps, like everyone during this pandemic, I’ve experienced days of anxiety when I’m not very good to be around.  There’s no obvious reason for when and why they occur but I’ve learned to keep in mind that these days of anxiety and bad moods only last a day or so. I can usually get rid of the angst by working in the garden or going for a walk. I don’t think my gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation have influenced my experience of health, except insofar as certain health checks (e.g. breast and cervical screening) and illnesses are gender related. Growing up and learning about health and well being I suppose I came to know about good diet from my parents, particularly my mother, through the food she prepared and which I ate. Also my father through the vegetables which he grew. I don’t remember any discussions with anyone in my young life about what was healthy, though as children we were expected to spend most of our free time outside ‘doing things’. I suppose it was ‘health’ by example, rather than being sat down and told. One area of health that was strongly focused on was dental hygiene.  I think this was because my parents had both had their teeth removed as young adults and they wore false teeth. I was regularly taken for dental check-ups to a surgery in the nearest town. I learnt the importance of dental hygiene pretty quickly when I had teeth filled without anaesthetic!! (Why did some dentists consider this acceptable?)  At secondary school (far too late – we’d already heard it from older friends) we had a few strange talks about sex and relationships, without any mention of what we really wanted to know about sex! I have no memory of other discussions about health at school.  Sports teachers at that time did not make the connection between sport and health. My mother gave me a book about the physical changes experienced by a young girl but she couldn’t bring herself to talk much about such matters, though she did forewarn me about the arrival of periods. Key moments I was never aware of any bodily changes associated with puberty (apart from growing taller) until I had my first period at 13. I remember it well -it was just after Christmas and I was recovering from chickenpox. After days of extreme itching, this strange event was the last thing I wanted and I wasn’t comfortable with the new status. I didn’t want my mother to tell my father but, at the same time, it felt as if I had reached an important milestone among my peers.  I wasn’t at all well-endowed as a teenager so the first visit with my mother to buy a bra was really just something for the future! She bought me a bra (untried) and we came home. Growing older There is now a great deal of awareness about the importance of keeping fit but I can’t recall hearing much said about it when I was growing up.  As a young child and teenager I went horse-riding once a week and I had a scooter and then a second hand bike from the age of six. I regarded horse-riding as being directly related to my love of animals, not to keeping fit. Equally, the scooter and bike were the means of getting from one end of the village to the other quickly. Certainly I undertook very little activity with the intention of making myself healthier. I always hated playing team sports and was very thankful that I was never chosen to play for my secondary school as that would have meant giving up Saturdays. I never ever considered this kind of physical activity of contributing to my health and well-being. I was always one of the last to be chosen for a team and, being left-handed, could never quite follow the instructions for holding the hockey stick, for example. When my children were young, I regularly pushed them in a double buggy up the hill into town. At that time in life I was probably the fittest I have ever been, though fitness arose out of necessity, not from design. When we later moved to a warmer country for a few years, I swam regularly and joined a local jogging group.  Being in a warm country means that you are outside for more of the time and sport seems so much more fun than hockey on a pitch that is still frozen.  Again, the exercise I did wasn’t directly related to the pursuit of fitness for its own sake. It was only when I started to approach the menopause and I began to put on weight that I started to consider exercise as necessity, rather than something for fun. About three years ago I joined a women-only gym and worked off about a stone in weight.  I could see a difference in my body shape within two weeks of joining the gym and exercising for 30 minutes, three times a week. But it wasn’t just losing weight that was important. My BMI went down, as did my blood pressure.  I have sadly put weight on since the first COVID lockdown but it is my intention to get back into the gym when it is safe to do so. Since I turned 60 I have become very aware that more of my life is behind me than is ahead, and I want to make use of all of what is left in good health.  I think this attitude is now with me for good, particularly now the pandemic has shown up how being overweight is a contributary factor to the severity of this disease. Health, wellbeing and appearance My body is still going through changes associated with the menopause – hair now almost grey, losing body shape, etc.  Throughout my early life I was told that I looked younger than my actual age – that can be a double bind when you aren’t taken seriously in work situations. I now find I can’t hide my age unless I have my hair coloured and so on.  I’m not sure about this and am working through my own preconceptions about what it means to become older.  Unlike the key moments of growing up, the onset of middle and old age is insidious and I can’t deny or change it.  If I’m bothered about my appearance, I can merely hope to make the most of what I’ve got.  If my concern is with my health, however, then the healthy habits I adopt might enable me to live well and actively into old age.  Fingers crossed. Like many people I have been influenced over the years by ideals of beauty. When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s many of the teenage girls I knew wanted to look like skinny model Twiggy, though our diets at that time (suet puddings, pies and so on) didn’t necessarily lend themselves to that kind of body.  I can’t recall anyone I knew ever trying to diet to look like Twiggy. When my parents married two years after the end of WW2 they were both slim.  Perhaps this came about from years of restricted diet during the war years.  According to my mother, my father had tried to build his body up as he was so skinny at one point. I think he must have been influenced by ideals of manhood in magazines – they didn’t have a television and rarely went to the cinema so wouldn’t have been as influenced by film advertising as subsequent generations. For them and their contemporaries there was never any thought of not eating the food you were offered – you ate what you were lucky enough to be given. For this wartime generation, ideals of beauty or physical appearance were tempered by the ability to get hold of the clothes (or material to make the clothes) that you wanted to wear.  When basic materials were scarce, make do and mend was de rigeur. It has become a cliché in our throw-away society but two generations ago it meant that ideals over appearance were always tempered by reality. That said, I would find life very difficult if I couldn’t have a supply of good face and hand creams and Vaseline to keep my lips moisturised.  My Desert Island item would need to be a face cream and I’d hope that the coconuts on the island could be used to make the rest. Getting ready to leave the house Our parents didn’t go out a great deal in the evening when we were growing up but, when they did, their routine was set around our bedtime routines – we would be in pyjamas ready to go to bed and then they would change into their best clothes. We didn’t have a shower so it would have been a quick wash first. My mother usually put lipstick on but she didn’t otherwise wear much make up. My father probably shaved first, but I’m not sure. It’s all far in the past but I was never aware of much in the way of preparation as they didn’t have the time or inclination. Both of my parents worked. When we got up in the morning they worked round us. We all had breakfast in the kitchen at roughly the same time. Then while they washed up, we had just enough time to use the loo (one toilet) and get washed (one bathroom) and dress in our bedrooms (if we hadn’t already dressed before breakfast). We left to go to school before they got ready for work and left the house. One of the luxuries of being retired is that we have a house with two bathrooms and only need to share when the family comes to stay. Ironic, then, that COVID has meant we haven’t been able to have visitors for so long."

We have been lucky that we haven’t had any need for medical or professional help yet. Emotionally this period is tough because it keeps us apart from our family and close friends and it also forces the two of us to spend so much time together, when we each have our own interests outside the home. As parents and grandparents we feel disenfranchised to some degree because we are not allowed to go and see our children and grandchildren because we all live in separate ‘bubbles’. Generational relationships are changing too: we’re now told by our grown-up children that we’re in a vulnerable age group and must follow the rules. My silent response is that we aren’t that old and we don’t need telling, but I suppose we’re now hearing the things we said to our children when they were younger coming back to haunt us! It’s all taken in good fun and we know it’s still necessary at the beginning of July that we still maintain social distance. As there’s no vaccine, it’s also becoming clear that our old ways of life have changed for the time being, even though many businesses have restarted following lockdown: shops are now open and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers can reopen tomorrow (4 July 2020). There’s quite an emotional impact in learning the numbers of people who are now out of work as companies close down or fail to re-open. The continuing financial crash will make these aspects of the pandemic yet more severe. The Government: I began writing this Directive several weeks ago and have only now in July come back to finish it. One of the good things about this delay is that I can reflect on what’s happened so far. I’m convinced that if we had locked down sooner, fewer lives would have been lost to this horrible disease. We had been waiting for several weeks for it to arrive and had been staggered and horrified by the huge numbers of deaths elsewhere, particularly in Italy, Spain and France. I’m convinced that, when it came, most people took serious notice of the instruction to stay at home to protect lives and the NHS. It was absolutely astonishing to hear that the Prime Minister’s aide Dominic Cummings had found it acceptable to drive over 200 miles from London to his parent’s house in the North East when his wife (and then Cummings himself) apparently developed some coronavirus symptoms, so that their small son could be looked after by family. Up until that point I believe everyone had stuck to the rules -there were reports of parents in similar situations all around the country continuing to look after their small children unaided while they were both ill from the virus themselves. This whole thing was such a debacle and so disturbing that I wrote to my MP, Jo Churchill, to complain about Cummings’ behaviour. She wrote back saying basically that she agreed. Yet Cummings and Johnson seem unable to understand what was wrong with what Cummings did: one rule for him and another for everyone else?? It is hardly surprising that ‘Black Lives Matter’ marches, illegal raves, crowding on the beaches have been going on since this time and that there are spikes in infection in different places. At the same time as fighting the pandemic, the government has remained hell-bent on sticking to the 31 December 2021 as the final transition date for leaving the EU. Yet businesses are closing down everywhere because of the pandemic and the UK has not yet worked out a trade agreement with the EU. The focus of Boris Johnson’s attention is now the economy and it seems as if all manner of building applications will be allowed since construction is foregrounded as a major way to ‘restart’ the economy. There is little evidence of new trade agreements with other non-EU countries. All in all, the government’s poor planning on Brexit has been wiped out by the virus and there seems little hope of economic recovery for years. News As always, I hear the main national and international news through BBC radio and television. I listen to local news on Radio Suffolk and read the East Anglian Daily Times for local news – I have taken out an online subscription since lockdown. We watched almost all the press conferences at 5 and were surprised that they have now gone altogether, yet there are still spikes in infection.  Most of the press conferences were informative and reassuring, particularly the statistical parts led by the scientists and medical officers. It’s vital for everyone to have access to the news and for it to be offered through BSL or other means where needed.  I suspect that social media need to improve the kind of news that is made available on their sites -there is clearly a sector of the population that does not watch any of the main news channels and appears not to have a clue about what is going on in the world. Work and home life I am no longer in paid employment but went back to university last year to undertake research study and I have continued with that as far as possible: all journals and some books are available online, as are many primary sources.  Interaction with the university is via Skype and Teams.  Having this focus has been quite a luxury during such horrible times as there is a good deal of mutual support between staff and students at the university. In many ways I am lucky that I am not having to home-school young children as are some other students; the downside of it is that I would love to be able to do that to help my grandchildren, but am not allowed to do so. Other than that, life at home carries on much the same as usual, while all round the UK thousands of people have died from the virus. Technology: Yes, I’ve tried a few more forms of technology during lockdown. I’ve learnt to use FaceTime, Zoom, Skype and Teams.  I’ve had two or three formal meetings on Skype and Teams and several less formal family and friend get-togethers on FaceTime and Zoom. It’s been great to talk to close family via FaceTime, as otherwise it would not be possible to see them, but it is definitely not a medium you’d use in preference to being close to them. I avoid Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so don’t find them a form of escape. What am I missing out on? Shopping and Food: To start with it was difficult to buy groceries because we had to ‘shield’ for health reasons and couldn’t go to the supermarket. In the first few weeks it was impossible to book a delivery from anyone, but we eventually booked deliveries from Tesco’s, Morrison’s and a wholesaler who normally supplies restaurants and caterers. The most reliable suppliers have been a local baker and a farm shop which sells most things -both have a ‘click and collect service’ which I feel confident in using because there are few people about there. We ran out of milk and were very low on many items before we had the first delivery. We were careful to make everything do two meals where possible and ate more vegetables to make meat or chicken go further.  I would say we are eating more healthily because we didn’t go out initially, the cafés were shut and we avoided the coffees and snacks we might otherwise have bought out. That said, we baked scones and fruit cakes from ingredients in the cupboard but didn’t have any icing sugar so couldn’t make sponge cakes with fillings. When you hear of the numbers of people who have lost their lives to this horrible virus, our experiences were entirely trivial and of no consequence at all. Life in the last few weeks has calmed down and it’s been easier to get slots for food deliveries. I continue to use local small farm-shops and the baker and have yet to do my own supermarket shopping.  Entertainment and Leisure: When lockdown came in, out went my two or three weekly visits to a local women’s gym. The exercise bike that has languished in the garage for years came into the living room but hasn’t been used much.  On the other hand I have done a lot of gardening and we usually go for a walk in the village once a day. Being outside has been not only vital for mental health but it has been such a privilege to see nature changing daily. During the good weather in May and June I took books outside and read in the shade of a tree in the garden, but it’s sometimes been hard to concentrate. I took out my sewing machine for the first time in ten years and made a few face masks, though I’m not sure I would count that as a hobby. They took ages and didn’t fit very well! Personal hygiene: Everything is pretty well the same as normal – we had, or were able to order, adequate supplies of soap, shampoo and so on.  The biggest thing for me and most people has been the fact that we haven’t been able to have our hair cut. Hairdressers open tomorrow (4 July) and my hairdresser in the village has offered me an appointment on 16th. I can’t wait – my hair is usually fairly short but it’s grown a good deal since the last appointment in March and I now need to pin it back.  My husband keeps his hair short all over (#2 at the barber’s) and, in desperation, he persuaded me to cut it for him with his beard trimmer. That was a first for me and I have to say it looked all right – except that #2 on his trimmer turned out to be shorter than at the barber’s .. Sleep: Sleep is often in quite short supply for me in normal times: I have periods of very slight sleep and often feel ‘heavy’ and tired as a result of this. Strangely, during the pandemic I’ve slept much better, even in the hotter weather and long nights. This has been surprising but I suspect it relates to the fact that I now have fewer obligations to be at certain places at specific terms.  It could also be a symptom of slight depression but, either way, on many days I have felt much more refreshed and rested than usual."

Mass-Observer W2322 describes themself as male; retired teacher; age 76.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Autumn 2020 Directive Part 2:  Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Health means far more than the absence of illness, and it is also much more than physical health or fitness, which is just a small part of the complicated, interrelated facets of ourselves.  Mental health is also part of wellbeing, but so are also the spiritual, social, sexual and creative parts.  Wellbeing embraces all of these, and if one is missing or out of balance, we suffer.  In particular, people who give full attention to the physical body (whether for beauty or strength and fitness) are missing the point entirely and end up with problems, not a balanced, happy life. Consequently I find it difficult to think of 'a healthy body' in the abstract, since it is totally bound of with the complete person, and the personality.  I suppose five words would be: alert, fit, smiling, intelligent, natural.  You see?  Even now I cannot isolate five purely physical words.  I can think of a person who personifies these facets but anonymity must be preserved here.  So I'll just say that she is Welsh and in her fifties. Identity I have never thought of this before.  I don't think gender, ethnicity, social class or orientation have any effect at all.  Available time and income certainly do, but not these other factors. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I am sure I was well into adulthood and parenthood before I was really aware of these issues – probably when I was thinking about how my daughters would grow up. My mother will have been responsible for my health when I was growing up, but I can't recall it ever being discussed.  If I had a bad cold, the doctor was called (and in those days, actually made a home visit), but there was no general discussion of health, diet exercise, or anything related.  Certainly nothing occurred at primary or grammar school, although I was taught the Latin tag of mens san in corpore sano, which I suppose is the basis of my standing on this issue.  But we learnt it in Latin, not in Health Studies, which is a subject my school would have scoffed at. Key moments Puberty and adolescent changes were hugely embarrassing for me.  Without being told I realised that anything to do with growing up and particularly sex (the word was never pronounced at home, which has left me always being awkward with the word) was completely taboo, so I pretended that changes were not happening. Facial hair appearing was an embarrassment.  My father only ever used a cut-throat razor so it was painful and dangerous sneaking that to try to remove my embarrassing hairs.  Semen on the bedclothes?  How I hoped my mother wouldn't look too closely!  There was, of course, nobody in my life that I could discuss such matters with, and nor did my prestigious grammar school dare to mention them. I still feel embarrassed, thinking about such things now! Growing older When I was younger I always seemed to be renovating houses.  This was partly because of interest but mainly because of lack of funds.  In the same way, I used mostly hand tools, partly because I couldn't afford to buy lots of fancy equipment and partly because I enjoyed doing things the way my father always had done (he was born in 1880) and had taught me.  Similarly, I gardened quite a lot, partly for pleasure and partly for food, and always using hand tools.  So there was no conscious decision to do keep-fit activities, nor was choice involved: I just kept active doing what needed to be done – as people had done for generations past. Since retiring I have wanted to keep active both mentally and physically. I enjoy walking, sometimes longer-distance, like the length of the Kennet & Avon Canal, or stretches of the South West Coastal Path, and partly just going to the shops.  In two successive houses which covered thirty years of my married life, we lived about a mile from the centre of a town, and if at all possible, I would walk into town and carry items back with me. I am now a mile from village shops, and just under a mile to the sea, and most days I walk to one or the other, and often both. My aim is to walk a minimum of four miles a day (though to be honest, I don't always do that}.  I am very pleased that we live in a house with stairs, and not a bungalow, for the constant climbing up and down keeps my legs and heart in trim.  We lived in a bungalow once, for four years, and I got very lazy!  It is a dreadful mistake for older people to move into a bungalow! The other aspect of physical health, of course, is looking after the body, both in terms of diet and in not abusing it.  I have never smoked not taken drugs, and drink alcohol very seldom, maybe a small glass of wine once a year? I've always liked a diet that included fruit and I've included more and more vegetables over the year, so I certainly meet my 5-a-day overall, though of course that is an average and we don't slavishly calculate this every single meal or day. My wife and I take turns with the food preparation (and the food shopping), so we each take responsibility for buying and preparing healthy food. We seldom use convenience foods and have never had a meal delivered to our door! Mental activity has always been important to me – after all, I was a teacher.  I have always aimed to read widely, although when bringing up a family and teaching, especially the years of primary teaching, which is so draining, I had little time or energy to spare.  Now I aim to read a hundred books each year, although it's often only about eighty or so.  On the other hand, quite a few of these, up to 25%, are in a foreign language.  My German is quite fluent, and I often write letters and emails in German; French was the other language I learnt at school; Spanish I took as a very mature GCSE student some thirty years ago, and in recent years I've studied Italian; I'm part of a small Italian study group in S. My Bible portion I read in Spanish each day, which forces me to look again carefully at familiar words and ideas. I have studied some other language using Duolingo (Russian, Welsh and Swedish), but although Duolingo are improving their courses all the time, it isn't really the best way to learn a language. Some day, though, I really do intend to return to learning Russian (which my wife is now learning through DL, as well as German, having sworn that she'd never really be able to learn a foreign language. So you can see that my home is full of determined linguists! Another small thing I do each day Always before breakfast) is a daily Codeword. I get information about health and wellbeing now partly from my wife (who is always better informed than I am on these matters), and partly from the television and internet. I'm not sure that I am more aware of my body now than in past decades, but I am certainly aware of ageing, and therefore how to stay fit and young in spirit.  I'm 76 now, but I suspect that my body age is quite a few years younger than that. I presume I shall continue to be concerned to stay fit and healthy all my life, and probably be rather annoyed with myself if physical illness gets in the way. Health, wellbeing and appearance As I stated at the beginning, health and wellbeing are only partly related to physical appearance.  I seem to remember wishing that my hair would stay in place as well as Dennis Compton's did in the Brylcreem adverts of the middle fifties, but I quickly grew out of wishing that I was other then I am. There are no health or beauty products I couldn't live without, although soap, a comb and a toothbrush would be jolly useful, even on a Desert Island; although, since there I would have 'an inexhaustible supply of needles', I might be able to adapt one of those for my teeth and so dispense with the toothbrush. Getting ready to leave the house My father left the house to go to do his work as a jobbing carpenter, until he lost his job because he was in his late seventies. He was already wearing his cap, so he ensured that he had a coat and above all his bag of tools, and that the ancient 1934 Triumph 8 would start, and then he left.  There were no rituals.  My mother and father never went out socially in all the time I knew them. It is 24 years since I went to work regularly; my routine ensured that I had my school bag(s) and any other equipment from home needed for that day. Because of the pandemic it's been a year since we've done any 'socialising' so the only routine that I recall about going out of the house in the evening is to ensure that I have with me the special coated glasses which enable me to be less blinded by these accursed LED headlights, which ought to be banned on the grounds of road safety."

Wellbeing means, to me, that you feel mentally OK – not always happy (that is unrealistic) but not always sad either. That you are able to enjoy things and be ‘in the moment’. A ‘healthy body’ means to me: • Fit; • Slim; • Tanned; • Muscled; • Looks good in lycra or other close-fitting clothing. The image that comes to mind is someone in a fitness advert. I don’t feel that my own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by ethnicity or sexual orientation. It has been influenced by my class because I can afford to worry about it, and attempt to do something about it; I have choices, even if it is to go out for a walk at lunchtime because my work gives me the freedom to do that. My gender does influence things because there is pressure to be slim, but I try to achieve this in a healthy way and not be too hung up on certain things and to be objective about how skinny models are and how realistic my ideals are. I cannot remember when I learnt about ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ – I don’t think that these were big issues in my youth, so it would have happened gradually throughout my adult life, by listening to items on the radio, watching programmes on TV, or by reading articles on the Internet. The thing I remember is my periods starting. I remember my mother telling my father (I guess it is a rite of passage for parents as well as children). I think that I started earlier than most of my classmates, and I had quite heavy periods (although I never had to stay off school) so it was mostly just embarrassing and trying to hide it. As I have got older, I have made more effort to address issues – I try to exercise more and, before COVID-19, I started Pilates classes to maintain or even increase my core strength and flexibility. Since COVID-19 I have done a lot more walking on a daily basis and have invested in a watch that counts my steps – not a FitBit as that seemed excessive, but the one I have does what I want it B7515 to. It felt a bit tyrannical at first, but it really has encouraged me to get out more! I try to moderate what I drink and make healthy choices on the food front. From a mental health point of view, some years ago I had counselling, which helped me improve my self-esteem, and I try to change views and reactions that I know are negative for me. I suppose that I am trying to become a better person, but for me, not just for other people. I get a lot of information off the Internet, but I avoid forums and other places where the information is likely to be suspect and prefer more mainstream provision. Overall, I am more aware of my body – I want to maintain fitness as long as I can! I think that people who are physically and mentally well show it in how they look and behave. They are comfortable in their skins and are able to take life’s knocks. I don’t think I have been overly influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance although, on reflection, possibly I have not aspired to them because I don’t think that I would be able to achieve them. So, I guess that is being influenced, of a sort. My parents always wanted to look nice, and they sort of followed fashion, but it was not all-important to them. Health products I would prefer not to be without are vitamin D and omega 3 oil, as I believe that these are beneficial, although I realise that I could, with some effort, obtain these in other than tablet form. The beauty product I would not like to be without is moisturiser and this would definitely be my desert island item. In general, my skin looks better if it is moisturised and from a practical point of view my dermatitis seems to flare up if, for example, my hands get very dry. If my parents were going out, they always put on fresh, smart clothes, and my mother would put on makeup and perfume. Even now, my mother does not like going outside the house without some lipstick on. If I am going out, for work I like looking smart and for socialising I like to dress up, as it makes it more of an event. In recent years I have experimented more with makeup, although I generally don’t wear it as I am not sure how to apply it (a vicious circle here) and I am not really prepared to spend the time it takes to put it on. I also don’t like it when it starts to come off! I would not like to be in casual clothes all the time and like having a job that requires me to look tidy. One of the things I have missed since the pandemic hit is the opportunity to get dressed to go out, as well as the being out itself. I don’t really understand people who go out to the theatre or for a meal just in jeans; dressing up is part of the outing, for me. As I have got older, I have been less inclined to follow this trend, and like to wear what I want to wear, regardless."

Wellbeing has links with ‘wellness’, I think, a concept that turns their own health into an absorbing hobby for people who don’t havemuch wrong with them.  Wellness has become an industry, allowing the capitalists to sell us a lot of unnecessary products. I don’t know whether it’s because I’m a gay man, or whether all men would do the same, but when I think of ‘a healthy body’, I think of a man’s body.  (Women would therefore think of a female body.) On the basis that both words and phrases are acceptable, the first five that come to mind are: slim, muscular (but not excessively), good skin, straight posture, clear eyes.  These are all outward signs suggesting that the internal processes of the body are being treated with respect and working correctly.  A particular person who comes to mind, not because I previously admired him or find him attractive, is the personal trainer and fitness expert Joe Wicks, who recently did a 24 hour workout for Children in Need.  Probably that achievement, which I did admire, is why I thought of him. He is obviously someone who takes his health very seriously.  Some adherents of gay culture make a big thing of being ‘fitness obsessed.’  This usually equates to bulging muscles, and depending on how those muscles have been achieved, may be due to a far from healthy lifestyle.  Joe Wicks (who is not gay) is slimmer and wirier: to me, proof that an improved appearance should not be the only benefit sought from a concern with health and fitness. Identity Top of the heap – those most likely to interpret their  health and wellbeing positively – would have to be, as in so many other areas, straight, white, middle class (especially privately educated) men, our society’s perfect conflation of sexual orientation, ethnicity, social class and gender when it comes to satisfaction at their place in the world. I score in two of these: ethnicity and gender. Broadly speaking, an individual’s health is informed by chance (medical conditions they may be born with or develop), the personal choices they make regarding diet and exercise, and access to health care. Wellbeing may be said to derive from how and where the person sits within the cross-currents of society’s approval and disapproval – this has an impact on their self-esteem and again on access to health care. Even now, society finds something to object to in the behaviour and attitudes of some women, the working class, Black British and British Asian people, and those who identity as LGBTQ. In some ways, these groups have to negotiate their essential unacceptability before they can hope to obtain the same level of consideration loud-voiced white men who learnt their sense of entitlement at expensive schools expect (and get) automatically. The Establishment (largely made up of such men) is naturally keen to blur the sharp lines of such differences. Last year, the Government’s report into why disproportionate numbers of ethnic minority citizens were dying of Covid-19 was partially suppressed: an article in the Independent on 13th June quoted a leaked copy as follows: ‘The unequal impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and asthma.’ The working classes generally have absorbed a related lesson: that their health is of less interest to everyone (including themselves) than the health of the ‘important’ people who run their lives. On 26th March, early in the pandemic, my friend N. emailed to say: ‘Tried going to Tescos in reasonable area, social class wise but the queues were too long, with everyone standing two metres apart for goodness knows how long before being allowed into the shop.  I was too impatient to wait so I went to Aldi’s in New Ferry, a rough area.  The difference made me laugh.  No one here was queueing or looking remotely bothered about catching anything.  I just think New Ferry folk have been through too many tough times to be quite so precious about their health. After all, they probably all smoke and drink too much as it is, so not new to taking risks as far as their health goes.  I bet if I went to Heswall, a very well to do area, they’d all be wearing masks, that’s if they ventured out at all, which is unlikely.’ On another occasion, she referred to those ‘from snooty middle class backgrounds with their sense of entitlement to eternal life.’ Class has an impact, not only on a person’s feeling that they have the right to ask for medical help, but also on their ability to meet those providing it on an equal footing and to ask for clarification when confused. N., who used to be a nurse, has told me of bereaved relatives meekly thanking a junior doctor when she and theother nurses knew that if it hadn’t been for that doctor’s mistake, the patient would still be alive.  I know we have all been socialized into praising the NHS to the skies, and I am not knocking them, but we secretly all know – surely? – that the best medical outcomes go to those who can afford private health care.  Perhaps we praisethe NHS so fervently because we don’t wish to see this. The only area where straight, white, middle class, privately educated men might be said to suffer is with their mental health, but even this they have turned to their advantage, pushing to the front of the queue with news of their redemption: they have broken free from the stiff upper lip regime in which they were brought up and are now proselytizers for emotional honesty. The TV presenter Phillip Schofield, although he does not qualify in all categories, typifies this approach with his disingenuousness over not coming out until the age of 58, telling Steve Wright on Radio 2, ‘Men are just rubbish talking about these things’ (conflating honesty about sexuality, even to oneself, with the acceptance and discussion of difficult emotions more generally). Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have two early memories of learning about health and wellbeing.  As children, my brother and I were only allowed sweets at Christmas and on our birthdays.  Even then we could only have them in the evening, just before we cleaned our teeth to go to bed.  My mother strongly disapproved of other women who gave their children packets of sweets to occupy them while they did their supermarket shopping. Later she told me that her younger sister D , who did not share her views, thought her attitude cranky and absurd.  Sweets would have been on ration until my mother reached adolescence (she remembered going to the shops to buy them for the first time when rationing ended; this would have been in 1953 when she was 14), so perhaps she never acquired much of a taste for them.  The message transmitted to myself and my brother was that sweets were bad for your teeth.  This meant that it never occurred to me to go into a shop and secretly spend my pocket money on them. The second memory is to do with my mother’sinterest in health and wellbeing (although it was not called that then).  In the 1970s, a health food shop opened in Shrewsbury, an era when such places – at least in Shropshire towns – were still considered unusual, and before chains like Holland and Barrett arrived.  Itwas called ‘Crabapple’ and the assistants had long hair and grotty jumpers – it was the mid-seventies after all, so not that distant from the peak of hippiedom – and sometimes, my mother noticed, dirt under their fingernails; but it was the only shop she could get fresh yeast for bread-making.  From that she progressed to mung beans and the chocolate substitute carob and the meat substitute TVP or textured vegetable protein, an early soya product.  She also bought the magazine Here’s Health and made recipes from it (I seem to remember the actress Andrée Melly, George Melly’s sister, was a columnist).  Our palates were not always co-operative, and we objected to carob for its dusty taste, and insisted on adding jam or raisins to the natural yoghurt she produced with her newly acquired yoghurt maker.  (But since she made the jam herself, that was not so terrible.) From those anecdotes, you can see that my mother took responsibility for our health and wellbeing when my brother and I were young. I don’t remember any specific conversations on the subject: it was more a case of following the behaviour that was being modelled for us.  My parents didn’t go out to pubs and only drank commercially produced alcohol around Christmas.  My father had phases of making his own wine (damson, blackberry, parsnip and other even less appetizing vegetables).  However, intake reached a natural limit because only the red fruit varieties were actually pleasant to drink.  Neither of them smoked.  I still remember with a little embarrassment an assembly I took part in early in secondary school.  The topic was smoking, and included the final line (suggested by my father), ‘And remember, if God had intended us to smoke, he would have put chimneys on our heads.’  The boy who said it then had to eat the cigarette-shaped sweet he’d previously been pretending to smoke. (Can you imagine it now?  Sweets made to look like cigarettes?  But they were common enough then, and as far as I recall, unremarked upon.) I don’t recall any sessions about health at school, either primary or secondary. I was in the schools system from 1971 to 1985, and I have the feeling that in those years it would have been seen as faddy and presumptuous for educators to advise children on their health.  That was the parents’job, should they care to interest themselves.  My impression is that the seventies were quite laissez-faire when it came to preventative health measures – for all ages. We had sex education classes (known as ‘Learning to Live’) at grammar school, and Iimagine we would have been tentatively informed about sexually transmitted diseases, although I have no memory of it. As an adult, although I have occasionally bought magazines like Men’s Health or used the internet to research diet and fitness, I don’t feel that they have been major influences. When I took up running, I got a book out of the library. When I wanted to eat more healthily, I bought a book of recipes. I am too old and the wrong sex to have been harmed by the idealized images of female bodies in women’s glossy magazines, but I have certainly caught the harmful tailwind of its crossover to the male body via Instagram and so on. Although I take regular exercise, and often think I should do more, I have never been sporty. I was always amongst the last to be picked for team sports at school, so my friends were not the athletic types. I was more or less left behind by the peer pressure to be physically active.  I think it is worse for teenage boys and young men now due to a combination of a more sedentary lifestyle (e.g.: hours spent playing computer games) and the social media emphasis on looking fit and ‘worked out.’ The two modes are obviously incompatible.  Key moments I started shaving when I was at sixth form.  At my grammar school (a different institution), I seem to remember some talk about shaving in our final year.  One boy was keen to tellus he had got an electric shaver for either his birthday or Christmas.  I don’t remember being particularly impressed; more puzzled, I think.  I suppose at that age, boys are eager to adopt it as a marker of manhood.  After 35 years of the monotony of it, I wonder why anyone would be so keen to start.  There was a path to negotiate, of course, one subject to the critical attention of other boys. In the other class in my year, there was a boy who was absent for great stretches of time, and who was frequently bullied when he was in school.  He developed facial hair early on, and got given the nickname ‘Wookie’, after Chewbacca in Star Wars. The bullies homed in on the unmistakeable discrepancy between his undeveloped social skills and premature signs of manliness. I don’t recall my father taking much interest in my starting to shave.  We were driving along one day, and I must have been talking about it, because he said from the front of the car, ‘A cat could lick that off with a bit of butter.’  As an expression that sounds like an old country saying (and probably was, given his background), I quite like it, and I know he meant it as a pleasantry, but it made me feel unsupported and rather confused. I don’t remember my voice breaking. When my grandfather died, a lot of sheet music which had been stored beneath the seat of his old piano stool came into my brother’s possession (he was musical, and played the trombone and recorders). I do remember one day us trying to sing through something, I think from The Sound of Music. (This was far from typical behaviour, by the way.)  I could still get the high notes and my brother couldn’t, and I felt pleased with myself because my voice hadn’t broken yet. Subsequent to this, in the eighties and nineties, there was a vogue for individual choir boys releasing records – Aled Jones and Anthony Way, for example.  Naturally there was a certain amount of speculation about how long their careers could last, and I began to see the breaking of a boy’s voiceas a kind of menace waiting to jump out at them in the middle of a concert. At some level my parents were probably embarrassed by the bodily changes associated with my puberty.  We were not a very physical family.  My mother used to sometimes say – in a deliberately comical voice –‘Move your bo–dy’ when I was in the way of her doing something, and I would feel uncomfortable at her even saying the word. I was very self-conscious.  Aside from a changing voice, and facial (and body) hair, there is a third rite of passage implying that all is progressing internally – psychologically and sexually – as it should: the first girlfriend.  Since this never happened either with my older brother or myself, and was never spoken about by my parents, perhaps it tended to overshadow the other stages and make them similarly difficult to address. Growing older It’s my belief that children, as long as they don’t suffer from any condition that marks them out from other children, don’t much consider their bodies.  Adolescence brings self-scrutiny, and for me, extreme self-consciousness, so much so that I avoided examining my body in detail.  That sounds strange, but it was sometimes years before I noticed a particular detail about my physical appearance, for example that one of my ears stuck out more than the other, that should always have been obvious. Even now, I could not say which one it was without checking in the mirror.  My self-criticism was reserved for my internal rather than external features; the latter I hardly dared consider. This meant I lacked an obvious motivation for exercise: vanity and the urge to improve my appearance.  I was physically robust and so my health did not trouble me. Any exercise I took came by accident.  I was apprehensive about learning to drive, avoided it, and therefore had no choice but to cycle twelve miles a day, there and back, to my first job at a country park outside Shrewsbury.  The penny began to drop when I was unemployed, and again at university: I took up swimming and even went to the gym.  I kept this up for a while following university.  Then, after a few years of inactivity, I began to think about taking up running.  I started in my late thirties and only stopped when I got my most recent job, which involved a four and a half mile walk each day. I went back to running when furloughed last March. My inaptitude for driving (I had a lot of useless lessons at one time) has been beneficial in that I have had no choice but to make exercise a part of my life: public transport does not extend everywhere, and there are some places I have to walk to if I want to get there.  My parents were always keen walkers.  The conviction of my mother’s sister Dinah typifies that of a lot of people: why go anywhere on foot when you have a car? Visiting my mother, I sometimes used to walk five minutes to the newsagents and recognize in a parking bay the car of a next-door neighbour who had driven the same distance.  In my childhood, I would hear adults saying, ‘It’s hardly worth getting the car out’ over such circumstances, but it seems this attitude may have lapsed. Over the years, I have come to understand the importance of mental health as well. The culture did not care about it when I was young.  We heard about older women, with what we would now see as anxiety issues, being shamefully addicted to tranquillizers. (Even the name: ‘tranquillizers’! what a thing to give to a human being!)  I say ‘shamefully’ but it was not their fault if they were buckling under the roles assigned to them by society, and after all, it was the doctors who prescribed the drugs.  I once went into a church and saw on a tray of candles burning to send prayers up to God, one with a note that said, ‘Please help me, as my nerves are very bad again.’  I also sometimes heard female relatives or other older women talking about people they knew (almost always female) who had suffered nervous breakdowns – a condition that was to me impalpable and mysteriously conclusive. (How did you know when you were having one?  How did you get one if you wanted one?) I have been through three serious bouts of depression: from 19 to 20, at the age of 30 and again around 36, the first with suicidal thoughts, the second a prolonged period of incapacity.  I had counselling for the second and third bouts, and have had other forms at other times (hypnotherapy, group therapy), but it was not until I saw a counsellor for a year of weekly sessions following my mother’s death that I experienced any long-term benefits.  I am not suggesting that I was actively depressed beyond the years listed above, but the modes of thinking that gave rise to the depression were still very much operative. A piece of advice I found helpful from one of my earlier, apparently less successful goes of therapy was the value of daily exercise in boosting and maintaining mood. I’m 53 now: inevitably, as my body declines from its earlier peak of health, I am becoming more conscious of its appearance and functioning.  I have a developing cataract in my right eye which requires laser treatment; I have recently had an upset stomach for a few days so of course was worried I had stomach cancer; when I began to wear reading glasses, I glanced down at the wrinkles and cross-hatching of my hands as though for the first time, and thought, Where did that old man who is holding my book open for me come from? I once saw a documentary about an elderly upper class couple and their daughter who were clinging onto the dilapidated country house that had been in the family for generations, but which they could no longer afford to heat or repair.  They were obviously at the end of their tether but putting on a brave face in line with their class and upbringing.  The middle-aged daughter was discovered by the camera crew on her hands and knees, hopelessly grubbing up weeds from the drive.  That pretty much encapsulates my attitude to my health and wellbeing in the years to come, I think.  Health, wellbeing and appearance Earlier, when you asked us to define ‘a healthy body’ in five words, I came up with ‘slim, muscular (but not excessively), good skin, straight posture, clear eyes.’  Even as I was writing this, I realized I was avoiding thinking about the disabled body, and felt uncomfortable.  Can a disabled body be a healthy body?  Yes, of course; but in other cases, no, due to the nature of the disability.  Regardless, it is still a body worthy of the same respect as everyone else’s. We tend to think of conventionally attractive bodies as healthy ones, but they may be just the opposite: enviably slim women may be starving or purging themselves; enviably muscular men may be abusing steroids.  Such people look ‘right’, but the dangerous regimes to which they subject themselves don’t just damage their bodies but are also evidence of disordered thinking.  Both their physical and mental health are under attack. Activism comes in waves, and from different places at different times.  A few years ago, we heard a lot from fat activists, claiming that a person could be fat and still healthy. Undeniably, this is true, up to a certain point on the scales; beyond this, it is delusional and harmful.  Phrases such as ‘body-shaming’ and ‘body confidence’ entered the discourse; I even remember hearing that fatism was the only remaining prejudice it was publicly permissible to have.  (This was before transphobia, and before the Black Lives Matter movement reminded people that racism was far from over.)  Those of a less theoretical mindset – say, overweight middle-aged men – indignant at having a high body mass index (BMI) would fatuously argue that members of the England rugby team had the same score and they were top athletes.  While I would never want anyone to hate themselves for the body they occupy, it seems obvious that being plump or well-covered, although not ideal, is okay, whilst being obese is a health disaster waiting to happen, and should be a motivation for change.  In that sense, health (and by extension, wellbeing) is related to external appearance. Who isn’t influenced by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance?  Even if an individual holds out against them, they are still reacting to their influence. We also have to remember that ideals are not fixed and change over time: for example, modern actresses impersonating stars of the past (Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn; Marisa Tomei as Mabel Normand in Chaplin) are strikingly anachronistic in their slimness when compared to the originals.  After a lifetime of being fed images of more or less conventionally beautiful people, and internalizing these standards, I would be sad to see them superseded; I would miss them.  The only part of the film Moonraker I remember is the ending: for some reason, a crew consisting of pairs of beautiful people, 1979 style (lip gloss, big hair for both sexes), were flying into space (perhaps the villain was planning to restart the human race from the best eugenic stock on another planet), whereupon Roger Moore foiled the mission and bailed out with his leading lady. I always assumed the spaceship crashed and all the beautiful people were killed, which for twelve-year-old me considerably overshadowed the supposed happy ending of James Bond smooching his co-star. I am sure my parents were influenced by the physical ideals that were popular in their youth. My mother was a keen cinemagoer and probably wished she was more like Betty Hutton or Esther Williams (two of her favourites) when she was a child.  As she grew into adolescence, there was always her mother, a highly critical personality, to remind her that she was not measuring up.  My mother’s cousin J was a part-time model for Silhouette corsets, and had the hourglass figure admired in the 1950s; my mother was slimmer and what my grandmother would have called flat-chested in comparison.  ‘Why can’t you be more like your cousin J ?’ my grandmother would say.  ‘She has a lovely figure.’  (Years later, J confessed that her mother employed the same tactic in reverse: ‘Why can’t you be more like your cousin R ?  She’s so clever.’  God forbid that either of the girls should actually be praised for the gifts they had.) My grandmother did not deliberately set out to spoilher daughter’s confidence: the lessons she had absorbed as a child about her value in the world (as a poor, working-class girl) became a kind of conduit for the transmission of further damaging information: that decade’s somewhat oppressive standards of beauty and acceptability. Obviously, I could ‘live’ without all and every health and beauty product, but it would be uncomfortable and embarrassing to do so in modern society.  I would feel ungroomed and self-conscious if I was the only one deprived of them.  On a desert island, expectations would naturally be lower (and I might be shipwrecked by myself anyway): sunscreen to guard against skin cancer would be my first choice there. Getting ready to leave the house My parents’ routine for getting ready to go out to work (father) or to a social event (both) took place behind the closed doors of the bathroom and their bedroom, so I only ever saw glimpses of it.  My own routine is the commonplace one of washing or showering, shaving, moisturizing, applying deodorant, fiddling with my hair, dressing and so on: not very interesting."

Health I live on my own, and have been on my own throughout lockdown.  I am an introvert and like time away from others, so for me this period has been pleasurable – entirely so for the first two months. I have had the odd dip, but overall my mental health has been very good.  I get to do what I like, and have been blamelessly absent from work for a great stretch of time with more to come. I have been able to see that when I was working, I underestimated the toll that being around other people (even though I mostly liked them) and doing stuffI didn’t particularly enjoy took on my energy.  Having said that, I wouldn’t want to live like this permanently, so I suppose the knowledge that it is a time-limited opportunity is a definite factor in my predominantly positive mood. I would also say that nobody is totally an introvert, and since the start of June, I have felt more of a need for human interaction and a slight but increasing dissatisfaction with my isolation. Previously some people liked to bang on about their wonderful lives, fabulous partners and adorable children, but over the last few weeks, in all seriousness, experts have been telling us that spending too much time cooped up with our families is damaging to our mental health. I might say, Well, which is it? –but that’s obviously unfair. Not everyone who’s keen to let you know they love their family is a performative social media copycat.  Too much of a good thing is still too much.  On Wednesday 8th April, one of the topics on Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 phone-in was couples falling out because they were now with one another all the time. He made the point that couples are usually together, when awake, for an average of two and a half hours a day, but that under lockdown this has increased to 16. My friend N. and I discussed our mental health during lockdown (she has had her own issues in the past).  She said, ‘Living with others involves doing things you don’t like constantly, especially when you are the one doing all the domestic chores.  I manage by spending most of my day alone.  We all do really.  We all have things to do which don’t involve anyone else. E [youngest son] spends most of every day on his own, practicing organ, whether or not its lockdown.  He said to me that he is actually perfectly content with the current situation because he is used to being on his own and that the joke is on those who normally have a hectic social life and like going to parties. Its definitely one nil to the introvert, and that makes a nice change. In some ways I think being in lockdown as a couple would be harder than with more people.  I feel sorry for my parents in this respect.  They find each other annoying at the best of times and now there is never anyone else around to dilute the tension.  I’m pleased you recognise the benefits of being on your own.’ My physical health has improved as well.  I have got back into running, and go three or four days a week, and take walks the rest of the time.  I had a few injuries (pulled muscles) in the early weeks, but sent off for a couple of calf support sleeves, and have been fine since.  I have noticed my stamina improving throughout.  One morning recently, I came back from a session (twenty minutes of running, one minute of walking, ten minutes of running, another minute of walking) and felt so invigorated and pleased with myself! (but with no-one to tell). I’m not sure Ican describe my emotions separatelyfrom my mental health.  One of my characteristics is to put off things which I find disagreeable or uninteresting.  (For example, I either glance at and don’t deal with, or don’t even open, some items of post for several weeks.) Most of the time, this doesn’t really serve me well.  However, the behaviour asked of all of us under lockdown has enabled me to put off many things I don’t ordinarily enjoy – e.g.: going to work, dealing with other people – without having to feel bad about it. If my mother were still alive, I would be very worried about how she was managing; but there is no-one close to me who is especially vulnerable, and so I have no anxieties about anyone else’s health.  I paid off my mortgage more than a decade ago and have a lot of money in savings, and although the possibility that my place of work (in the hospitality sector) might never re-open saddens me, I would be able to support myself for years to come. Some people, not personally affected, will look back on this period as a happy time.  I know the same is not true for everyone.  I imagine a lot of extroverts are having a miserable experience. The Government I wonder how many contributors will say that the Government have been doing a good job. Not many, I would guess.  Tribal loyalties fall away when people are in fear for their lives.  Based on the notes I made, I’ve categorized some of the failures: The Government’s incapacity to act Looking back at my coronavirus diary, I was surprised that only five days separated Boris Johnson’s speech to the nation announcing lockdown (Monday 23rd March) from the news he had the illness.  The Conservatives, banking on his supposed popularity, have so far promoted him as a presidential figure.  He stands for the Government.  But there we were, only a few days in, leaderless.  In fact we had been leaderless – with regards to the pandemic – long before that. Johnson is a dilettante, emphatically not someone who likes to knuckle down to anything, and while the virus was ripping through China and then Italy, he found it comfortable to believe it couldn’t happen here.  During an interview on This Morning in early March, he noted complacently that he was still shaking hands when he visited hospitals.  As the infection rate rose, it became apparent the Government were afraid to make major decisions.  On 16th March, the news reported that Welsh and Scottish schools were to close from the following Monday, which left Johnson’s Government in a position where they had no choice but to look weak and play catch up.  On 17th March, they couldn’t find the courage to order the closure of pubs, theatres and restaurants, instead telling the public they should stop going to them.  It was left to theatres to cancel future performances, in effect closing themselves.  Discussions with colleagues at work were mostly about the inevitability of some form of lockdown (as instituted by other countries).  Marketing manager A, the boringly doting mother of an eight year old, felt the Government were holding back so lockdown could coincide with the Easter holidays (in Birmingham schools broke up on Friday 3rd April) to mitigate childcare issues.  S (mid-twenties, bright, a bit lairy) was still going to the pub and casinos, but also thought the Government should have enforced lockdown a fortnight before.  Subsequent to his hospitalization, when Boris Johnson was recuperating at Chequers, he was taken to task by the Sunday Times (19th April) for his early refusal to take the virus seriously; they reported he had failed to turn up to five meetings (which he would have chaired) of the Government’s emergency COBRA committee.  By the end of May, research was suggesting that if lockdown had begun ten days earlier, many lives could have been saved.  In this period, there was a big UEFA football game in Liverpool as well as the Cheltenham races.  In both areas there was a notable spike in cases afterwards. On 10th June, Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the Government’s chief scientific advisers, told a Parliamentary scrutiny committee that 20,000 lives (at that point half of those who died, according to official figures) could have been saved if we’d gone into lockdown a week earlier.  It has been a commonplace for journalists to remark that the Government were worried people would not comply with a long period of lockdown, hence the delay.  Ifyou accept this, the Government’s indecisiveness may be said to proceed not from their own weakness but from the poor character of the electorate – as perceived by them. In fact the overwhelming majority of the public behaved very well.  How many of them are aware that this was contrary to their Government’s expectations, I don’t know, but it’s surely unlikely to have gone down well with those who picked up on it.  Exaggerated sense of their own competence/the public’s respect for them When Boris Johnson was in hospital and Health Secretary Matt Hancock was self-isolating, I noticed ministers solemnly informing us that ‘the virus doesn’t discriminate.’ Michael Gove was one of these. Whoever would think it did? As though the virus would say to itself, Well, Iwon’t go anywhere near members of the Tory Cabinet, they’re far too special and important. To even make Gove’s comment out loud, you must think you belong to a special and important group, and that other people naturally think so too.  On Good Friday (10th April), the night after Johnson had been moved out of intensive care, his father, in an interview on Radio 4, absurdly said that his son having the virus had served a purpose in getting people to take it seriously.  These two attitudes plainly stem from the same fundamental core of self-conceit.  My reading of the situation was that sympathy for the PM was paper thin with most people, and any attempt to exploit his illness to obscure uncomfortable truths about his handling of the crisis was likely to backfire.  The front page of that day’s Sun read: ‘Boris Is Out (Now that really is a Good Friday!)’ and claimed that his leaving intensive care was ‘delivering a huge boost to the nation’s morale ahead of the crucial Easter period in the coronavirus battle’.  Thenotion that his health was key to the mental well-being of the country was tone-deaf and propagandist, and coming at a time when more people than ever were ‘seeing through’ him, I would have thought self-defeating. Distraction techniques A weird phenomenon of lockdown was the sentimental, almost hysterical, popularity of Tom Moore, a 99 year old, who undertook to walk 100 laps of his garden before he reached his milestone birthday.  This was to raise funds for the NHS, and he eventually collected over £30 million, as well as releasing an egregious duet of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ with Michael Ball.  He seems to have left the army at the end of World War Two, but was described everywhere as ‘Captain Tom’ and an ‘army veteran’ rather than the ‘ex-managing director of a concrete company,’ which according to Wikipedia is what he did afterwards.  As of 20th April, 850,000 people had signed an online petition to upgrade him to Sir Tom.  On his birthday (30th April), the Queen promoted him to honorary colonel of the regiment he’d left three quarters of a century previously.  Permission for a celebratory flypast by a Spitfire had originally been turned down on the grounds of inessentiality; then the Government, seeing the possibilities of some beneficial feel-good publicity, changed their minds, and Boris Johnson filmed a congratulatory message.  Their technique is to identify something the public already likes, and then jump on the bandwagon.  On 20th May, it was announced that Colonel Tom was to become Sir Tom. The broadcaster Stig Abell commented on Twitter: ‘It is totally deserved, of course, but it does feel that promoting Tom Moore might have become a displacement activity forgovernment.’  Of the replies, many agreed with him, but some complained of negative media coverage.  One person said, ‘I think this tweet is beneath you.  Why can’t we just celebrate the recognition and not try to imply some ulterior motive?’  The incapacity of some people to see the blindingly obvious amazes me. Why are they so content to take things at face value and not question them? However, given that this is so, it is obviously worth the Government’s time to pursue a policy of deliberate distraction.  Another example was the minute’s silence for ‘key worker heroes’ at eleven am on 28th April.  This was heavily promoted and propagandized beforehand by the news saying things like, ‘At eleven o’clock this morning, people across the country are expected to fall silent to show their gratitude and respect for blah blah blah.’ That was the day Boris Johnson returned to work, and it was certainly no coincidence the Government waited until then: the initiative was obviously designed to benefit him politically. I asked myself at the time, Why even do it now – in the midst of the crisis? To be brutally frank, the key workers hadn’t finished dying.  They didn’t start doing the two minutes’ silence halfway through the First World War – they waited until the first anniversary of its official end. My theory was that it was purely to give us plebs something positive to focus on. We were to fall silent for those who had died instead of asking about the Government's cutting of funds to the NHS, which would have contributed to those deaths.  Pious silence prevents difficult questions, as a Second World War poster might have put it. Attempts at news management On Easter Monday (13th April), it was hard to avoid Boris Johnson’s video statement after leaving hospital in which he thanked NHS staff and specifically singled out two nurses (one Kiwi, one Portuguese, which was a nice opportunity to give two fingers to the anti-Brexiteers who accused their opponents of being racist) for watching over him through the night, making sure he kept breathing.  A reporter on Good Morning Britain actually said that ‘some are referring to them as Boris’s angels.’  This personal angle, deliberately tossed to the papers, would give them scope for distracting sentimental stories about individuals rather than looking at the larger issues (such as the underfunding of the NHS) for which the Government ought to be held accountable. The GMB reporter also said that some people might find it inspirational how quickly the Prime Minister had recovered from the virus.  The media can be so unbelievably docile and unreflective: that would have been the exact message his PR team wanted putting out. When I saw the video, in which two or three days after being in intensive care, Johnson was wearing a suit and tie, I thought, in what sort of mad world is that considered appropriate dress for someone who recently almost died?  But it was all about projecting power and control, and trying to make us believe that there had not been a break in his authority.  He could have been wearing the suit over his pyjamas; it didn’t matter.  He read the speech theygave him, went to Chequers and got into bed – where even the GMB reporter said he was likely to be recuperating for the next two weeks and possibly longer.  So the ‘inspirational’ nature of his recovery was a sham because he was still recovering and would be for some time yet.  (GMB was far from the only media outlet to fall for this; they were the rule rather than the exception.) When Johnson went back inside after making his Downing Street comeback speech on Monday 27th April, the BBC camera zoomed in on the Thank You, NHS pictures stuck in the window of Number Ten.  I groaned and rolled my eyes.  Again, that was why his PR team put them there, so that they could be picked up by the news, and a subliminal message of a caring administration transmitted to the television audience. Given Johnson’s dubious track record with marital infidelity and unacknowledged children, who were we meant to imagine had produced these pictures? Inability to admit mistakes At the Wednesday 10th June press briefing, unusually headed by the PM because he had some more easing measures to announce, I saw not for the first time a journalist trying to get him to admit the Government had not got everything right.  (The Swedish approach was to take a light touch to lockdown, with poor results, although not as poor as ours; their PM recently acknowledged that mistakes were made, as has Emmanuel Macron of France.)  But Johnson, and also Matt Hancock, continue to insist either that all decisions were the right ones made at the right time, or that now is not the time to look at this. I said to my brother on the phone that the journalist, knowing he was going to get the same bland defensive answer as the others who asked the same question, should have said instead, ‘Of all the things you’ve done right to tackle the pandemic, which is your favourite?’  The sarcastic, implicitly derisive element of this might have flummoxed Johnson (many things seem to), and even if it hadn’t, would have made clear the contempt the public feel at the Government’s refusal to admit any fallibility.  The Cummings scandal This erupted on Saturday 23rd May when both the Guardian and Daily Mirror reported that Johnson’s senior political advisor Dominic Cummings (widely seen as the brains behind the throne) had broken the Government’s lockdown rules.  He and his wife had driven from London to Durham in case they both became ill and needed help with childcare from family members.  I remembered a couple of months previously the news reporting he had coronavirus symptoms, but the explanation for his conduct now involved his wife being ill and him doing the driving.  There were immediate widespread calls for his resignation and public anger built rapidly over the weekend.  (Forget Stanley Johnson’s silly theory that his son’s illness communicated the seriousness of the virus to those who don’t normally pay attention; this story genuinely cut through like no other aspect of the crisis.)  The public immediately saw that Cummings had acted contrary to the guidelines (which he would have had a hand in drawing up).  However the Government chose to stand by him, and damagingly re­explained their own rules in an attempt to clear him.  Senior ministers such as Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock said that Cummings hadn’t done anything wrong, either ethically or legally, and emphasized the size and newness of his kid (it was small, it was young, it was a toddler) and his anxiety as a ‘good father’, i.e.: tryingto pull at the heartstrings of the nation’s parents.  Then the Mirror released a further story about a second journey he’d taken to a Durham beauty spot to enjoy the bluebells.  People furiously complained that they hadn’t visited dying relatives in their last days because the Government had asked them to hold off for the country’s benefit, and still Johnson – presumably frightened of having to manage without instruction – clung to his advisor. On Sunday 24th May, he stepped in to chair the press conference at the last moment, and threw his support behind Cummings, saying he was satisfied his aide had acted with integrity.  Several scientists, who had advised on lockdown measures, said publicly that the Government had trashed their own policies, and made uncertain the public’s loyalty to any future changes.  On Monday even the Daily Mail said Cummings should go, which must have been an unpleasant shock for the Tories, the Mail being a barometer of their middle England demographic.  The BBC1 morning news showed Cummings being hounded by press photographers as he got into his car (a situation he would previously have happily engineered for his political enemies).  More and more Conservative backbenchers, their inboxes swamped with angry emails from constituents, were calling for him to go.  Expecting others to swallow his views on integrity when he has none himself, was not the only aspect of the scandal to set Johnson’s Achilles heel throbbing.  He should have enough political sense not to make pronouncements on parental responsibility; and yet Cummings was, he said, ‘simply following the instincts of every father.’  For me that was the most offensive development to date, since it manifested such a jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness, of arrogant obliviousness to his own wretched morality (Johnson refuses to confirm how many children he’s got or whether he’s involved in all their lives).  In a highly unusual move for a political aide, Cummings gave a press conference on Monday afternoon (for which, with diva-like contempt, he was thirty minutes late).  He claimed that the second trip, to Barnard Castle, was undertaken to check whether he was in a fit state to drive back to London the next day.  Apparently one of his possible coronavirus symptoms was blurred eyesight, so he took a sixty mile test drive (to and from) with his wife and four year old, and sat on a bench by the river for fifteen minutes when theygot there.  And then only because he ‘felt sick’, he said.  Even Laura Kuenssberg on the ten o’clock news qualified this explanation with ‘supposedly.’  It was soon pointed out that the trip was on his wife’s birthday.  More Government figures spoke up for him: Lady (previously Nicky) Morgan affected to see all this as ‘a very human explanation’ and said that some people would never be satisfied.  Myopinion was that he should have just admitted wanting a day out. A burst of honesty, even if only partial and at such a late stage, would have been far more ‘human’ than such obviously cooked-up nonsense.  In the days following, I saw or heard on more than one discussion programme a theory that Cummings was being hounded by the enemies of Brexit.  By discrediting him, these enemies (‘Remoaners’) were really hoping to discredit and then delay the Brexit project.  Initially it came from right-wing panellists (an ex-Brexit party candidate, a Daily Express columnist), but by day two a member of the public phoned to give it as her opinion.  I got a strong sense of briefing behind the scenes, on agreement on this as a way of shutting down the story.  It said that if you voted remain and were incensed by Cummings’ behaviour, your feelings were not legitimate and were actually part of a conspiracy theory.  It never rang true for me: I think people had enough to be angry about over his trips to Durham and the illegitimate explanations for them without worrying about his previous track record.  Possibly the most damaging aspect of the situation for Johnson was that as many people were now laughing at Cummings (and by extension the shambles of the Tory Government) as were furious with him.  Many people combined the two.  A Machiavelli cannot also be a figure of fun, and the eye test explanation was a gift for jokers everywhere.  Trip Advisor suspended new reviews on Barnard Castle because people were swamping them with satirical versions (‘a site for sore eyes’).  Various memes circulated on Twitter, such as a photograph of a van in motion, and written on the back, ‘This journey has been approved by Dominic Cummings.  Eye test in progress.’  In the Guardian Marina Hyde compared Johnson minus his adviser to David Hasselhoff’s character in Knight Rider without his talking car telling him what to do.  The front page of the Daily Star (27th May) featured a cut out and keep Cummings face mask: ‘Free: Do whatever you want and sod everyone else mask. Can’t be arsed to stick to the rules like the rest of us?  Simply wear this handy Dom face covering and you’ll get away with murder.’ More seriously, an opinion poll in the Daily Mail found that 66% of Conservative voters wanted Cummings sacked.  By Thursday 28th May, 61 Tory backbenchers publicly agreed.  A minister told Laura Kuenssberg off the record that he was aghast at the Prime Minister’s willingness to burn through his political capital to save his aide.  West Midlands police noted an increase in ‘pushback’ from all generations when they spoke to people about lockdown infringements.  Several bishops criticized the Government for their lack of moral authority.  On the first Saturday of the scandal, I noted in my coronavirus diary, ‘Although Iwould like to be proved wrong, my prediction is that he won’t resign, and that even if he does, he will return.’  My prediction so far has been correct. The main thrust of the public’s objection to Cummings’ behaviour and the Cabinet’s support of him has been, ‘Huh, it’s one rulefor them and another for the rest of us.’  It occurs to me that Johnson et al struggled because that is an equation so fundamental and obvious to their view of the world and themselves, that when others feel the need to say it out loud, it strikes them as bizarre and elaborately unnecessary.  (‘Of course those of us in charge may behave as we choose; that is one of the benefits of being in charge.’) This left them in a hole when the best, most obvious solution would have been to disavow this way of thinking.  It rapidly became too late to convince the public otherwise.  All they can hope is that by the next election, voters will have forgotten.  It will be interesting to see how this pans out for them; it’s undeniably agamble, and one I hope doesn’t pay off.   Lying The Government were not above lying.  This is a difficult term in politics, since we are used to statistics selectively employed to reinforce particular positions, aspirations passed off as solid facts, empty assurances, comforting exaggerations, etc.  However, Matt Hancock has spoken of a ‘protective ring’ being thrown around care homes to protect vulnerable occupants when we know the opposite was true: there was a policy of untested hospital patients being discharged into such places.  Beds were reserved expressly for this purpose.  Some care home managers have given interviews about the pressure put on them when they refused to co-operate.  If I had any faith in the efficacy and dynamism of a future public enquiry, I would characterize this as a time bomb under more than one Cabinet member’s chair.       Has the Government done anything right? Of course: two examples which come to mind are the suspension of train company franchises for six months with the Government helping them financially so that limited services could still be offered; and the Chancellor’s furlough scheme whereby 80% of the salaries of those unable to work from home were paid by the Government. ‘Apparent success’ vs. a cold shower of overseas opinion During his comeback speech after recuperating from Covid-19, Boris Johnson talked about other countries looking at Britain’s ‘apparent success’ in managing the virus.  The implication was that they would either be envious or intending to copy our strategies.  I would say that if you can only characterize a success as an ‘apparent’ one, then it’s not worth reaching for the term in the first place.  Seven days later, on Monday 4th May, it was announced that coronavirus was listed on the death certificates of more than 32,000 patients – the highest figure in Europe.  Later that week, I read an interesting article in the Guardian (‘Complacent UK draws global criticism for Covid-19 response’), arguing that the rest of the world was appalled by the mess Johnson’s Government was making.  It quoted the opinion of an Italian newspaper (Corriere della Serra): ‘like a nightmare from which you cannot awake, but in which you landed because of your own fault or stupidity.’  Ethnos, a Greek newspaper called Johnson ‘more dangerous than coronavirus.’ The Irish News wrote: ‘Ministers of slim talent have bumbled through daily briefings and now big business-Conservative donors are impatient to reverse a shutdown so contrary to Brexiteer dreams.’  Scott Morrison, the Australian P.M. called the early herd immunity policy ‘a death sentence.’  A former Australian high commissioner to Britain condemned ‘a shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn’t happen here.’  That wasn’t the first time I’d come across such criticism: the political journalist Ian Dunt said on Twitter that whenever he came into professional contact with experts from other countries, whether they were right-or left-wing, all were equally incredulous at Britain’s incompetence. What steps will the Government take over the next few months? Heavy hints are currently being dropped (as we approach the end of June) that social distancing will be reduced to one metre.  Inevitably this will happen, since the hospitality industry cannot hope to survive without it.  Nor will schools be able to fully reopen.  The Government will continue with its apparent random and unconnected measures to loosen lockdown.  Their eye seems drawn to anything which might be popular and – they hope – occasion little kickback, e.g.: zoos and safari parks opening again.  They will continue to manoeuvre their scientific advisers into fall guy positions ready for the public enquiry.  They will admit of no mistakes in their response to the crisis.  The right-wing media will come back on board to prop them up.  If the popularity of the new Labour leader Keir Starmer continues to build, and that of the wounded Johnson to fall, then we may be looking at a new Conservative PM – but not quite yet, not this year.  (If Johnson gets kiboshed, it will be interesting to see whether the Telegraph would have him back as a £250,000 a year columnist; I assume not.)    News My primary source for news is the radio news, Radio 2 and 4.  I usually listen to the last hour of JeremyVine’s lunchtime phone-in on Radio 2; his discussion topics for the last three months have been mostly to do with the virus.  I have also watched the Channel 4 and BBC television news.  I read the Guardian online, but Twitter is probably the online source I check most.  Twitter accounts I look at regularly include those of the political commentator Ian Dunt, the academic Sarah Churchwell, Marina Hyde and other Guardian writers, the Front Row presenter Stig Abell, the broadcaster James O’Brien, and political journalists Tom Peck (The Independent) and Michael Deacon (The Telegraph). I then sometimes go onto the accounts of people whose views they’ve retweeted.  (I’m aware of the theory that we mostlyutilize social media as an echo chamber for our own opinions; these accounts are mostly within the lefty-liberal bubble. In fact I don’t look at Stig Abell’s as much since I found out he used to edit The Sun.) The ‘Trending on Twitter’ sidebar is a good wayof keeping tabs on the issues currently agitating users (who are somewhat representative of the country at large). Although I ‘knew’ that Twitter was not authoritative, and that I should really be seeing it as a source of entertainment, contrary outrage and detail neglected by the traditional media, I still had to learn this lesson.  On 29th April, I emailed N. and said crossly (based on what I’d read there): ‘I was surprised to hear this morning that Boris Johnson’s fiancée has had their baby already. I thought it was months awayyet… It all becomes clear why he rushed back to work [after being hospitalized for Covid-19] and was putting himself about on television in the last couple of days. He’s now on a fortnight’s paternity leave, so he had to show his face between the two bouts of absence otherwise people would have complained even more about his lack of leadership (which they’re doing in any case.) I know he’s entitled to take the leave, but did it ever cross his mind, do you think, to postpone it? Or did he just think, Ooh, brilliant, I can put my feet up for two weeks now. He himself has described the current crisis as the greatest this country has faced since WW2. Wouldn’t a decent leader understand that certain sacrifices are expected of him? And does anyone actually think he’ll be changing nappies or painting the nursery?’ Later on, having checked"

I think defining a “healthy body” is very difficult as you don’t know what is going on inside someone’s body by just looking at them. I think it’s very wrong to attempt to describe a “healthy” person by their appearance as this is often deceptive and hurtful. I lived with my parents until I was 20 but remember nothing about my mother discussing puberty. I remember she gave me sanitary towels but it was all very hush-hush even though there were only 4 of us in the house – Mum, Dad, my sister who was 5 years younger and myself. I cannot remember receiving any health or sex education at school and probably learnt everything from friends, magazines and personal experience. I do remember getting my first bra – it was white with pink roses on it and was bought in Woolworths. I’ve no idea how old I was. My father in particular had several health problems and was a real hypochondriac most of his life. He had bovine TB in his youth and naturally my Granny molly-coddled him terribly. He panicked at the slightest twinge but because of his experiences in hospital with TB, he refused to visit a doctor –until he had a heart attack when 57. He recovered but eventually died age 64 from thrombosis after once again refusing to see his doctor. I think this has probably influenced me over the years – the slightest twinge and I think I’m dying – usually with cancer or heart problems. I suppose I’ve got worse as I’ve aged – no-one lives forever. It tends to come and go a bit – sometimes I feel fine and positive, then something happens andI’m not sogood. In the main though, I’mhealthy – as far as I’m aware…. One thing that really annoys me is that GPs now constantly refer you to the NHS website and I’d much rather see a real person than Dr Google. Covid has made this much worse andat our practice, it’s impossible to even speak with a GP on the phone. For a large part of my life, I have suffered from anxiety and panic attacks but these have improved significantly over the past 10 years or so. I now volunteer for a local mental health charity – having 1 to 1 sessions with other sufferers and also leading a relaxation workshop. I’ve been trying to walk every day for 30 minutes to an hour for some time now and really find this helps keep me fit physically and mentally. I also spend quite a bit of time working in my large garden. I think I probably try harder now to look after myself but reckon it may be too late! I eat good meals but snack far too much on chocolate, biscuits etc. I’m probably about a stone overweight and am really trying to lose that stone as I know it will make me feel better. I don’t really bother too much about my appearance and rarely wear make-up apart from a little lipstick. I would find it uncomfortable to not wear face moisturiser and my Desert Island item would definitely be hand cream. My mother was certainly not into make-up and didn’t bother with face cream either – only lipstick. I think I spend more time getting ready now when I do go out to meet anyone as it’s such an unusual event. I hope that as I get older, I’ll still be able to get out and about and keep myself looking respectable!"

I have decided to start it up again – perhaps with not the enthusiasm or detail as before. Part 1 – 24th March 2020 I’ve had a quick look back into my diary till the beginning of the year and the first mention I can find of the coronavirus was on 31st January when I mentioned that there had been the first two cases confirmed in England. I must have been aware of it before then as I am an avid watcher of the BBC News but can’t have thought it to be of any real threat to us here in the UK. Of much more importance that day was the fact that the UK left the EU – “no cause for celebration” was my comment as I had hoped right until the last minute that it wouldn’t happen. I think the next few weeks were taken up with Storms Ciara, Dennis, Harry & Meghan leaving the Royal Family, family issues etc and the next mention I made was on 25th February about South Korea and Italy being badly hit and people quarantined in Tenerife after an Italian tourist had been confirmed as having the virus. I’maware that people had also been quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan but I think it all seemed pretty remote. About that date, things like hand gel started to become difficult to get but I managed to get a couple that day – I use it as a matter of course anyway. My next comment was on 2nd March to say the first Scottish case had been confirmed in Tayside – they had been to northern Italy like most of the other UK victims. Still OK as it still seemed at a distance as I don’t travel abroad at all and am mostly within the Lothians and Borders areas. Also that day, I had a call from my 95 year old uncle in Clevedon near Bristol. His son and family had been skiing in northern Italy…. – they’d been back for 10 days and all seemed well. I think I was more worried than he was! He’s a very fit 95 year old, both physically and mentally but it was starting to appear that the elderly were more at risk. By 5th March, Scotland had 6 cases – all connected – and still none in the Lothians. Friends and family had now stopped booking holidays, long weekends etc and on 8th March, the Lothians had its first 2 cases. In Italy, over 16m –a quarter of the population had been quarantined with over 360 dead! It was all starting to get a bit scary. Boris Johnson gave a major briefing and was speaking about over 70s and people with underlying health problems being more at risk and on the 11th there were 36 cases in Scotland and 8 in the Lothians. By now, the shops had become unbearable – for some reason, toilet rolls were flying off the shelves – you’d have thought it was the norovirus! Also pasta, rice, tinned foods, eggs etc etc were becoming more and more difficult to get hold of and in some places, fights were breaking out over packs of toilet rolls! All weekend (14th & 15th March) and going forward, there have been queues of people waiting for shops to open and all sorts of restrictions have now been placed by the major supermarkets on the number of each grocery item that can be bought. Most of them have set aside an hour every so often for over 70s and at risk people to shop without having to fight through the hordes of people just going crazy and buying everything in sight. On 16th March, Boris Johnson announced that over 70s and the “at risk”groups should self-isolate although Nicola Sturgeon says that we should practice “social distancing” which gives a little more freedom. And that’s the story so far on 18th March 2020! I have decided to have no face to face contact with any friends or relatives but go out in my car and stop somewhere on the coast to have a walk, only passing others now and again –at a distance. I am fortunate that I can have regular contact by phone and e-mail but it will be a big change. I am a very sociable person and a member of several groups, volunteer with a mental health charity and meet regularly with friends and family – all that has stopped and everything I did has closed down. As regards shopping – well, like my mother did and my sister does, I have always kept a good store cupboard, fridge and freezer. I don’t stock-pile but very rarely run out of anything. Living on my own, I tend to cook and bake in batches and like a variety of dishes to choose from so usually have chilli con carne, Bolognese sauce, lamb curry, beef stew, stewed mince and homemade soups in the freezer. I also have tinned meat, beans, veg, fruit etc in the cupboard and all the necessary cleaning products, toilet & kitchen rolls etc that I need. If you live on your own, you need to do this if at all possible. It was really brought to home to me when I broke my foot six years ago and couldn’t get out for weeks. I hate depending on others to do my shopping although both my son and daughter live within 10 minutes of me. I also have a cat and always keep stocks of cat food and cat litter – along with seed, fat balls and peanuts for the many wild birds that visit my bird feeders. Also very important for me is to make sure I always have reasonable supplies of any medicines that I need if I am confined to the house for any length of time. I am very relieved that I have done so as things like paracetamol are virtually impossible to get hold of at the moment and I suffer from arthritis in my hands and have cervical spondylosis at the top of my spine. Due to the threat of shortages due to Brexit earlier this year, I had upped my stores a little so I feel at the moment I am well stocked without having to go out and join the many thousands who are panic buying. Just before I self-isolated earlier this week, I went into a couple of supermarkets looking for a couple of things and some of the aisles are just stripped bare. My main problem will be getting fresh fruit and vegetables I think. I have some frozen and tinned vegetables and some tinned fruit but may need to try to stock up now and again. I use soya milk and only on my cereal but have several cartons of the long life stuff so I should be OK. If I run out, I can have porridge made with water. I looked at the Tesco online grocery website this morning – 20th March – and both the delivery and “click & collect” slots go up to 9th April and are fully booked – absolutely crazy! Some of the TV pictures of people stripping the shelves in the major supermarkets are horrendous – some of the people are like animals. AtanEdinburghSainsbury’sstore, ayoungcouplehad comeintothestoreand started stuffing uncooked chickens and any other meat they could get hold of into 2 big suitcases! Fortunately they were seen by a member of staff who reported it to the manager and made them return the food to the shelves. (Edinburgh Evening News, Friday 20th March 2020) There has been a heart-wrenching video on the BBC of a critical care nurse in tears, just finisheda48hrshift whocouldn’t get any freshfruitorveginherlocal supermarket, pleading with everyone to stop panic buying – extremely emotional. My daughter works in the Finance Department of a Scottish council and although she has the ability to work from home, has not yet been given permission to do so. This is quite worrying as several workers in her large open plan office have already come down with the classic symptoms of the virus but have not been hospitalised so have not been tested. The lack of testing seems to be the one of the biggest issues at the moment – testing is only being done in hospitals if you are so ill to get taken there. Another major issue is what appears to be the lack of vital equipment – ventilators and personal protective equipment in particular. The government is working on it but the lack of it is one of the main reasons for the measures being taken to slow down the peak of the pandemic. I mainly get my information from the BBC. I’m not on any social media and amglad as there seems to be so many false rumours coming from them. I have not been a fan of either Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon in the past but I think both of them have responded and acted very responsibly. There are slight differences between NHS England and NHS Scotland but in the main, I think they are all pulling together. Well it’s now Tuesday 24th March and more severe restrictions were announced at 8.30pm last night. You can now only go out for essential food and medicines, once a day for exercise (walking/running/cycling), to help someone sick or elderly and for work but it should only be essential work that cannot be done at home. It all seems very surreal – just a few weeks ago, life was “normal”. I am lucky in so much that I have everything I need at the moment – will run out of fresh fruit and veg eventually – but lack of human contact and lack of incentive is starting to kick in a little. I have phone conversations several times a day so I am very, very luck in that respect but today is the first time I’ve felt a little emotional. I know that many people with mental health issues are really struggling and I have offered to make phone calls to clients of the mental health charity that I volunteer for. I have been told that this is not currently possible (probably due to data protection issues) but I hope this will eventually be allowed as a little chat – perhaps weekly – would I’m sure be of real help to our clients. Mother’s Day was on Sunday. Both my son and daughter came to see me – from outside! They left their gifts on the doorstep and we chatted for a few minutes about 12 feet apart. We chat on the phone regularly – my daughter in particular sometimes calls several times a day. I went out walking for an hour or so on Thursday, Friday and Saturday last week but in some places there were crowds of people. I gardened most of the day on Sunday but haven’t done anything apart from some gentle exercise in the house since then. I had to go out in the car yesterday. My little 15 year old cat has to get her claws clipped every three months or they curl into her pads and I heard her clip-clopping on the floor on Sunday and realised it was time for her to go to the vet. I called them and they said to park outside and they would collect her cat basket from the car and return it when they had treated her. I was a bit worried as I always take her in and hold her while her claws are being clipped but all went very well and she didn’t seem to mind her Mummy not being with her! I called the vet on returning home and paid the bill by card so didn’t have togo anywhere near anyone. I anti-bac wiped her cat basket down when I got home before I put it away. I called my 95 year old uncle last night and he still very well – just fed up. He’s been gardening a lot and had a visit from his son and daughter-in-law at the weekend who brought their own mugs to have a distant coffee! They were both pharmacists before they retired and suddenly realised there was an issue with the milk and sugar so have decided next time to bring a flask so that they don’t have to touch anything that may infect him! I have a friend in his mid 70s who lives alone. He is highly intelligent but slightly autistic and has difficulty with social situations. He is English and lived most of his life there before moving to Skye and then to the Scottish Borders about 6 or 7 years ago. He lives about 35 miles from me but I meet up with him fairly regularly and have encouraged him over the years to join in with things in his local area. He has built up a little circle of “friends” – but very much on his terms – often backing out of things at the last minute. Unfortunately this has knocked him for six and he is starting to panic in case he is banned from leaving his house – he says if that happened, he would go into his car, turn the engine on and kill himself! I have to speak to him every evening on the phone to try to talk him through things and reassure him and find it all extremely stressful. He has a grown-up son and daughter who live a fair bit away from him – they both visit infrequently and are also both extremely intelligent but also autistic anddon’t seem to realise he has issues – probably too busy coping with their own. I have no contact number for them and do worry in case I don’t hear from him for a few days. Part 2 – 27th August 2020 It’s now August 27th and the last time I wrote was on 24th March! Very strange really as in one way it seems like yesterday but in another it seems much more than five months ago. I think it’s because each day really seems very much like the one before and although nothing much seems to happen, life goes on. A lot has happened though – too many people have died and too many people have been very unwell and there seems to be no end to it all at present. Each day more figures and at the moment they seem to be increasing again. In the first few months during lockdown I felt that I was coping really well – the weather was fantastic, I went out for my hour’s daily walk enjoying nature and spent most of the rest of the time working in the garden. The places I went walking were peaceful, quiet and beautiful and I only met the occasional walker. Then – all of a sudden there was an absolute invasion of cyclists from other parts of the country (never mind the 5 mile limit on travel) who raced past almost knocking me over. They came in groups of a dozen or so from cycling clubs paying no attention whatsoever to social distancing, shouting to each other and whizzing past me on dirt paths as well as cycle/pedestrian paths. Then everyone seemed to get a bike –some wobbling by and falling off at times – and my walks ceased to be an enjoyment. I had to try to find other routes and eventually the only places I could find to walk safely were in the middle of housing estates because all the inhabitants had gone out on their bikes – crazy!!! So a couple of months ago I stopped going for a walk. I may start up again as the children are now back at school and things may be a bit quieter but the enthusiasm seems to have left me. As I live alone, am retired and have no grandchildren, my life has changed little apart from the fact that I spend more time at home and rarely actually see people I would normally see. Friends who regularly see their grandchildren seem to be finding it really difficult. I probably don’t feel as well mentally as I did at the beginning but I know I always feel worse as autumn and winter come along – I loathe the dark nights when the curtains are drawn by 4ish and not open again till 9ish the next morning. I seem to have totally lost motivation to do anything apart from my normal housework and garden. I am a member of the U3A and most of our groups came to an abrupt end. The only one still running that I’m involved in is Latin which we do once a month on Zoom. Since lockdown I joined both Zoom and Skype so have had a few conversations on Skype with an elderly couple I know who I usually visit regularly – it’s great to see themeven if it’s just on my laptop. I used to meet up with my ex-work colleagues fairly regularly – we all got on really very well although they are all in their 40s and into social media so my ex-boss suggested I join Facebook to see what they’re all up to. I don’t really do much on it but enjoy seeing them and hearing from them. My daughter phones me every day – at least once – but we usually end up arguing which upsets me. She criticises everything I say and sometimes I just wish she wouldn’t phone. She lives on her own too and all her friends are work colleagues so she’s missing the companionship. She’s met up with a few of them lately – socially distanced of course – but I know how lonely living on your own can be at times. My son and his partner of almost 24 years are on the verge of splitting up – she had been cheating on him off and on for over a year with someone at her work! He was pretty devastated at first but is now coming to terms with it –they are still living together in their flat but not communicating – very difficult. Fortunately, both of them have been working throughout – she works in a bakery and he in a fish distributors –it could have been very uncomfortable if they’d both been stuck at home. Or maybe things would have been different had Covid not happened as they may have been able to work things out. They have always gone on several holidays each year with weekends away too. Their hobbies revolved around football and walking but the football stopped and their walks were restricted. I had a bit of a health scare in May – I found a lump in my breast one Thursday night. I phoned my GP’s surgery at 8am on the Friday and was home again after having seen a GP by 9am! She thought it was OK but said she’d like it checked at the Breast Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. She assured me that it was very safe there and she would mark it as urgent. I received a call from them on the Monday giving me an appointment on the Friday that week – so within one week I had been seen by a consultant. Very fortunately, all was well – I had several mammograms and an ultra sound and several cysts were found. They checked the results with my previous routine mammogram done in September 2018 and nothing had changed so I have to have another one done in 3 years’ time. Naturally I was extremely relieved and very impressed withthe service Ireceivedboth at the GP’ssurgery andthe Breast Unit. My temperature was taken as I arrived, seating in the waiting areas was socially distanced and you could see the staff changing their PPE and washing their hands after each patient. In fact, I felt safer there than going to Tesco’s! It was a “New Patient” clinic and the receptionist said that contrary to the stories in the media, their unit had been just as busy as it always was. At the beginning, I tried to get Tesco online grocery deliveries but the slots were all taken up in no time so I gave up. I go food shopping – mainly to Tesco – once every 7-10 days. At first it worked really well as every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 9-10am was reserved for the elderly and disabled with a member of staff sanitising the trolley and basket handles, directing customers etc. They’ve now stopped that and you have to just muck in with everyone else. It’s so much busier now at that time of the morning as a lot of mothers go there after dropping their kids off at school and make no attempt to socially distance etc. My cooking habits haven’t really changed and apart from flour at one point, I didn’t have any problem buying what I needed. However, I must have been eating more as I have put on half a stone in weight. This is probably due partly to less exercise but mainly due to more snacking as I have been in the house more. Normally I’d be out having coffees, scones, lunches etc but I’d be moving about more and out with my walking group regularly. I’ve definitely watched more “rubbish” television. At the beginning I waded throughthe complete box sets of Downton Abbey but since then have ditched DVDs for TV – it’s easier and I’ve got lazier! However a lot of the time I just turn off the TV and perhaps knit or read if I can’t go out into the garden. I plan to paint all my outside window sills as the frames are fine but the sills are starting to flake – I wish I’d done it earlier when the weather was drier. My hut also needs repainting so I hope to get them all seen to before the winter sets in. I’ve got fed up watching the news as it’s the same old stuff hour after hour, day after day. I tend to watch the news at 6pm then maybe check it out on my laptop at different times during the day. At the beginning, it seemed as if everyone was pulling together but now all the media – TV and especially newspapers – are ripping apart the people running the country. They are only human and trying to cope with an unprecedented situation to the best of their abilities. They have and will have to continue to make really difficult decisions for a considerable period of time that could never have been imagined at the beginning of 2020.  The next few years – maybe even decades – will be really hard as the economy has been very badly hit – and it’s not over yet by any means. We are nowhere near the end of this pandemic and does another one lie in the future? A lot of really difficult welfare funding decisions will have to be made and where will the money come from? I think Nicola Sturgeon has behaved impeccably throughout and totally outshone the UK government – and I am definitely not an SNP or independence voter. Her briefings have been clear and concise and she has not been afraid to accept liability or mistakes whereas the UK government always seem to be fudging one issue or another. She and her team are always well prepared and presented unlike the UK team who often look as if they are uncomfortable at being there and have just dragged themselves out of bed. She answers all questions from the media knowledgeably without the humming and hawing that comes from the UK government. If she doesn’t know the answer, she’ll say she will get back to them – and she does. I don’t think my personal hygiene habits have changed all that much. My hair grew considerably longer during lockdown – I had it cut on 21st January and it wasn’t cut again until 22nd August. After comments from family and friends that it looked better and less severe, I decided to just get it trimmed and keep it longer. I’m always pretty paranoid about washing my hands at the best of times so just upped it ever so slightly. I’ve hardly worn make-up – twice I think since lockdown – what’s the point with a face mask on? I think I’ve only “dressed up” twice since lockdown and lived in house, garden or walking clothes. I don’t think my sleep has been much worse than usual. For the past 20 years now, I’ve suffered from bad night sweats – apparently fairly common for post-menopausal women. This means I can wake several times a night – I get up to the loo to cool down then go back to bed. Most nights I can get to sleep fairly easy both on first going to bed and when I get up during the night. Although I’ve been retired for 5 years now, I still wake early and normally get up between 7 and 8am then go to bed between 10.30 and11pm. Sometimes I’maware of my dreams but they’re quickly forgotten and luckily I don’t seem to get many nightmares."

A5854 Female, 75, married Bath, artist Five words.. Balance, Harmony, Resilience, Pain-free, Goodfood Health = feeling well, not in pain or suffering. Well feed but not over feed on good food, Able to get good dentist, GP, alternative therapies when needed Well-being = living in relaxed warm home, access to outdoors, creative, good -relationships, life/ work balance Imagine Healthy body = good clear skin and hair, body weigh stable and not grossly over-weight, strength in muscles. Influences on my experience of health & wellbeing Gender: being female I am aware of a heightened concern about my body image, how I ought to look, especially in western world. Not so much in my youth as I feel it is for my granddaughter. Ethnicity: not aware of ethnicity issues myself until I was much older when I became more aware of ‘ white privilege’ Social Class: as a child our family had high status, (my father was a clergyman) but low income and we only had money for essentials. As an adult I am much more comfortably off financially and as an educational woman I am able to ask for help and usually I am listened too. Sexually Orientation: as a married heterosexual woman I fit the norm and I think that still makes life easier. I don’t have to defend myself or feel I have to justify myself. Early Experience FOOD = As a family we are all meals together at either the kitchen table or more formally occasionally at the dinning room table. It was at the kitchen table that there might be conversations about food. Mainly about eating certain foods that weren’t necessarily favourites. Also eating everything UP. This was OK. Food was good. My father grew vegetables, my mother baked and made bread. It was a basic menu not very exotic; it was after Second World War and there was still rationing until late 1950’s I remember my father had a thing about chewing your food thoroughly. He also was the only one in the family who had a habit of eating between meals; he did put on weight and after a heart attack in his 50’s he changed this habit and lost a lot of weight. We were a tea total family and no one smoked. Part 2: Everyday Health and Well-being continued.. A5854 Female, 75, married Bath, artist REGARDING HEALTH = my brother and I were not vaccinated as babies for the major child diseases. My father had some objection to vaccines which I’m not clear about. So my brother and I got hooping cough, measles, mumps. We both had lasting effects from these. My brother’s eyes were weaker after measles and hooping cough left me with a sensitive throat and coughing even without having a cold. My mother also noticed that my growth slowed when I was a baby for a while. After medical tests and going to Children’s Department at St Bartholomew’s hospital in London who monitored me for years. It was thought that I had a slight attack of poliomyelitis. This left me with a slightly weak and smaller left side. However I don’t think we had chats about Health and Wellbeing at home. At secondary school there were classes called Domestic Science which included a memorial week when a group of three of us played house in a special flat within the school. We had to run it together as a home, cleaning, cooking etc. There was also weekly classes which included a wide range of topics from sex education, nutrition, to budgeting. A break though moment in relation to in-depth sex education was after I was married, living in USA and came across the work of Betty Dodson, especially her book ‘Masturbation.’ It was in the USA that I also got to know more about what gets called alternative or contemporary medicine. While in USA we were fortunate to have health insurance cover provided by a enlightened health group called Kaiser Permantente. Back in UK in 1975 with two young children we all seemed very healthy for some years. Maybe took good health for granted. Our lifestyle was active and we ate well. When I slipped a disc however I didn’t go to GP but to an osteopath. I feel this was the beginning of us not relying on GP/ NHS for treatment only. I have had a very good relationship with the GP’s and appreciate they skills for diagnosis. I’m aware that then I often make my own decisions about what treatment to go for the symptoms. Sometimes it will be to take prescription drugs, and medical treatment, other times turn to a contemporary treatment like acupuncture. As I have got older I have had more reasons to take more care of my health. The disparity of my legs has resulted in a knee replacement when I was 72, treatment for cataracts in my 60’s. We have moved towards being more vegetarian and follow the 5/2 eating routine. I have taken attention to my mental health seriously. Had counselling and also physiotherapy when I felt that I had emotional issues that need extra attention-more that I felt appropriate to share with friends and family. Very aware of ageing and that I’m slower and get tired, at the same time I feel well and enjoying life. Appearance. Always important. I’m tall, have good skin and had almost black hair, now almost white. Enjoy having good clothes and take pride in my appearance. I have never worn much makeup but since I got older I see that my face has lost definition, so I do now use lipstick and a little eye makeup. I now think I look better with glasses! I do look in the mirror before I go out. Jan 5 202u"

But as I learnt more and read about how serious the resulting illness can be I changed my mind. We have self isolated for 12 weeks since March 23. The day we came home early from a planned weeks break in Kent.The Government, Oh dear, what confusion, lack of clarify, acting late, not being transparent. Not impressed. Hard call but major lack or leadership.News: Think the news has been well presented by BBC and the newspaper I read, The Guardian. Have rationed how much I listen to and read,Work and home lifeBoth our sons have worked from home very successfully. As an artist I work from home and my husband as a writer does too. We both have really appreciated the lack of the usual interruptions. No social outings etc. I realised I had a deep longing for such time.TechnologyGreat help BUT as I have enjoyed the uninterrupted time, I have avoided filling the time by using much technology to be in touch with people. Dislike Zoom, just makes me aware what I'm missing not being with people and I don't like it. I understand it good for some work situations. Phone and emails and FaceTime I use for friends and family.Shopping and foodWe have been very fortunate. Local Farm shop providing weekly home deliveries for over 70 living within five miles. Supply fresh fruit, vegetables, diary, meat, some dry goods and bread. Also local Health food store delivers: need to spend £50 so used once every three weeks. PLUS have wonderful neighbours who checks up weekly to see if we need anything. Food and cooking have an added importance, meal times marking the day. We have also enjoyed better quality food. Haven't had food from a supermarket for months. Haven't been into a shop of any kind for 12 weeks.This week, June 15, went to an open air fruit and veg stall, was like going to the best sweet shop ever!Entertainment and Leisure, All home grown, in that we have a garden and the weather has been good and always lots to do. Miss theatre, art galleries, concerts, friend to supper very much.Personal hygiene, I have dressed as normal and worn jewellery. Not going to hairdresser has allowed me to let my hair grow longer which has been fun. Maybe worn less make-upSleepHasn't been an issue. Our young granddaughter, 16 ( not living with us) did have night panic attacks in the first few weeks of Lockdown, she was upset about no school and not seeing her friends and very confused and wanting to know when it would end."

Mass Obs Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: COVID-19 Health On the mental health front, I live on my own and have a history of anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and somewhat disordered eating habits. I was already a hypochondriac and germaphobe. The pandemic has inevitably made my anxiety worse, by essentially vindicating the most paranoid parts of my brain. I've been in a constant state of fear since about a month before lockdown began. In the first few weeks of lockdown, I cycled through a variety of symptoms: anxiety attacks, insomnia, crying, tension headaches, intrusive thoughts, difficulty eating, inability to focus, exhaustion, nervous energy, stomach pains & indigestion, constantly clenching my jaw, nightmares, and a sense of constantly being on the edge of panic. Since then things have settled down a bit. More than two months into lockdown, I'm still not sleeping well and having nightmares, but am only getting anxiety attacks rarely. I'm eating three meals a day, although they are sometimes snack-sized. I'm still exhausted most of the time, but have regained some of my focus (when I need it, at least). I still get intrusive thoughts about illness and dying every day and am near-constantly on edge, though. My fear has deepened as covid-19 has spread further, killed more people, and revealed itself to be much more complex and dangerous than a normal respiratory virus. As a result, I have become convinced that my flat is the only safe place in the world and am increasingly scared of going outside, especially for grocery shopping as that's the only time I enter another building. To me this fear seems perfectly rational, however it's clear that my friends and family do not share it to the same extent. It may take a very long time for me to stop thinking of everything outside my front door as a threat. It's hard for me to separate physical and mental health, as the physical problems I've been having seem totally interdependent with my mental state. These consist of recurrent stomach problems, mostly painful cramping, and a bad eczema flare-up. I've had eczema all my life and it hasn't been this bad since I was a small child. All over my legs, lower back, scalp, eyelids, and elbows are extremely dry and itchy sores. If I scratch, which is a constant temptation, they bleed and scab then don't heal. My legs look and feel especially awful, despite my applying emollient twice daily (I've tried various types) and cutting my nails very short. If I could, I'd go to the GP about this, as it seems to be gradually getting worse. Obviously that isn't an option until GPs reopen for non-urgent matters. I haven't required medical or professional help during lockdown. There isn't really anything a doctor could do about my current anxiety, as it's due to the pandemic, and the eczema isn't life-threatening therefore not important. I've been trying out various coping mechanisms, old and new, as well as keeping in touch with friends and family to distract me. My emotions over the last few weeks have been overwhelmingly characterised by fear. I'm afraid of the virus, of the incompetent UK government, of any relaxation of lockdown. I'm afraid for my family, for my friends, and for myself. I'm afraid I'll lose my job, that my job will get much worse, and that I won't be able to get another job. I can't see anything positive about the future and am afraid to think beyond the next couple of days. I'm afraid I'll never recover or be happy ever again. CBT taught me to try and counter these sort of anxious thoughts with more positive alternatives, but I can't do that at the moment. Distracting myself is the best I can manage. I feel momentary joy when I laugh with a friend on a videocall, or read something funny, or see a family of ducklings. Distractions don't last, though. The Government One of the ways I try to keep myself from spiralling into total panic is to pretend that Nicola Sturgeon is prime minister. Despite my attempts at news-avoidance, I saw on twitter that the UK has the worst coronavirus death rate of all countries collecting decent data. Sixty thousand excess deaths! That's so appalling that I can't get my head around it. If the government had even the remotest sense of shame, they would resign en masse and ideally go into exile on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the sea. Delaying the lockdown because of some misconceived notion of 'herd immunity' has killed tens of thousands of people. It nearly killed the Prime Minister, and honestly might have been better if it had. Any hopes that Boris Johnson learned some humility and humanity from his near-death experience have been dashed by the 'Stay Alert' fiasco and his response to the indefensible actions of Dominic Cummings. I simply do not understand what is wrong with the current government ministers. I am extremely glad to live in Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon's government has communicated much more clearly. She has not used war metaphors or the meaningless 'Stay Alert' slogan. The Scottish Government's plan for relaxing lockdown in four phases actually seems sensible and gives assurances of why things will happen and in what order. As a result, my support for Scottish independence has never been stronger. I worry intensely for my family in England, who do not seem to be taking the lockdown seriously enough. The nonsensical mixed messages from Boris et al have confused them. I wish I could spread my anxiety around a little, since I have an excess of it! In the coming months, I expect the UK government will continue on its path of making bad and stupid decisions, resulting in more preventable deaths. I absolutely do not trust Boris Johnson's government to prioritise public health and make evidence-based policy. I suspect England will see a massive second wave of cases and deaths. I can only hope that my loved ones will be OK and that Scotland will have more sensible policies and therefore be safer. News As the pandemic has unfolded, my tolerance for news fell to near zero. In the weeks before lockdown, I couldn't read the news without bursting out crying. I gradually restricted my access: stopped reading liveblogs, then checked news only twice daily, then only once daily, then stopped using twitter, then checked the news for half an hour once a day, then finally stopped reading news websites altogether. I've gone back to using twitter, but have muted or disabled retweets from people who post news more than incidentally. I only follow 50 people, in any case. I can't really cope with the news at all, which makes me feel weak and pathetic. On several occasions reading a news article about coronavirus has given me an anxiety attack. Conversely, it does worry me that I have no idea what's going on outside the UK, or what's happening other than the pandemic. Experience has shown that even small doses of news make me very anxious, though, and there's nothing I can do about these grim tidings other than follow the current precautions. Which I'm already doing. I get the latest developments directly from the Scottish Government website and Nicola Sturgeon's twitter account. I can't avoid seeing trending topics on the twitter sidebar, but try to avoid clicking on links or threads about the pandemic. I haven't watched any of Boris Johnson's broadcasts, as I absolutely cannot stand him. I have watched a few of Nicola Sturgeon's, although I prefer to read her statements afterwards and any new guidance documents. I mainly hear about whatever's going on with the UK government second hand via discussion with my friends and parents. A kind friend who is an epidemiologist has on several occasions tried to reassure me that some terrifying news article was sensationalist and not supported by data. It seems obvious that BSL interpreters should accompany government broadcasts of such critical importance. The fact that the Scottish Government does this and the UK government doesn't is emblematic of their respective attitudes to vulnerable people. Work and home life During lockdown I've been working at home as a university Assistant Professor. When lockdown began, I was still teaching as it was the second term of the academic year. I livestreamed a couple of lectures and tutorials online for students, without having time to change the material to suit this format better. All exams were subsequently cancelled, so I rewrote exam papers to be essays for online submission, as well as marking online rather than using hardcopies. In the initial month or so I was busy, however in recent weeks uncertainty about the next academic year has really sapped my motivation. Without clear decisions from senior management about what and how we're going to teach next year, beginning preparations seems pointless. I'm also struggling to work on a conference paper and journal paper I should be doing, as the research in both is thrown up into the air by the pandemic. The conference I submitted an abstract to will have to be held online, if not cancelled. My university has already warned staff that there's a huge budget shortfall this year and a much larger one next, so there will be some combination of redundancies, pay cuts, and reduced hours. Reliance upon the inflated fees paid by overseas students is proving highly counterproductive. Given that I've been on strike three times in the last two years over pensions, pay, workload, casualisation, and pay inequality, this is all very unencouraging. I'm very glad I can work from home and grateful to have a job at all, given that many aren't so lucky. I don't have space for a proper office setup in my flat, so have my work laptop on the dining table or on my lap on the sofa, then tidy it away at the end of the day. I am definitely not managing a full working week at the moment. In the absence of imminent deadlines and clear priorities, it is hard to focus and easy to get distracted. I do appreciate that online meetings are generally shorter and more focused than their face-to-face equivalents, whether they are with students or colleagues. Supervising student dissertations is working quite well online, although I feel very sorry for current students. Their education this year has been badly disrupted, first by strikes then the pandemic. Working from home does enable me to work around my insomnia -I quite often have an afternoon nap to make up for getting six or fewer hours sleep the night before. I live alone, so my home life has been solitary. I try to ensure that I speak to another human being each day, either a work meeting or call with a loved one. Technology Lockdown has quite significantly changed my relationship with technology. Prior to the pandemic, I deliberately tried to restrict my technology use, by turning off my router for a full day every weekend, using an unsmart phone, and deliberately choosing second-hand devices that were slow to discourage heavy use. I also limited my social media time in various ways. When lockdown began, however, this approach became totally inappropriate. I live alone, so technology became my only way of interacting with other people. As a consequence, I've started using a smart phone, returned to using tumblr, started using whatsapp, bought a new laptop, and stopped my internet-free days. I miss the peace and quiet of breaks from the internet, but they would be too isolating at the moment. I don't want to be left completely alone with my thoughts when they are so uniformly anxious. I have weekly videocalls with my parents and five friends (in four households), as well as weekly Bad Movie Night and less regular calls with at least five other friends and relatives. I mostly use Google Hangouts and Zoom for these. I'd never come across the latter prior to lockdown and have found it quite easy to use. With work colleagues and students, I use Microsoft Teams or Skype. I've even used my landline phone a couple of times, when videocalling didn't work for some reason. Using whatsapp has reconnected me with some old friends, which is good, and I definitely speak to several people more often now than I did prior to the pandemic. Many of my friends and all my family live outside easy visiting distance, so I was already familiar with videocalling pre-lockdown. I find it a good replacement for face-to-face conversation, although it cannot replace the feeling of sharing a meal or most other experiences. In some ways, technology-mediated socialising has made things easier and pleasanter. I don't have to network with strangers or deal with my more tiresome colleagues as much. Students don't barge into my office with questions. It's easier to arrange calls with friends as there's nowhere to go out in the evenings. I find the regular exchange of messages about creatures we've seen, food we've prepared, and craft projects we're working on touching and cheering. I'm fully addicted to whatsapp, which prior to the pandemic I refused to consider using, and exchange daily messages on it with at least three people. It provides a sense of low-key companionship and reassurance that my friends are still OK. I also find that my online socialising preferences are the same as face-to-face. In both cases, I much prefer speaking to one or two people, rather than a larger group. As for social media, I still refuse to use facebook and instagram because I hate them. I use twitter to keep track of some of my friends, although it does have the disadvantage of inevitable news exposure. I wish the trending sidebar could be disabled. I use tumblr for escapism, including pretty pictures, memes, and fandom content. It's easy to avoid the news on there. I use goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. I have a dreamwidth blog but have only posted in it twice since lockdown began. It's hard to resist mindlessly scrolling through social media at the moment, although I consider it a counterproductive distraction. I generally feel calmer when reading a book, however books require greater energy and focus. As the pandemic abates, I intend to reduce my social media and internet time. Social media probably doesn't actually help me feel less anxious, although at times it can appear soothing. Tumblr particularly so, as it's like flicking through a fiction-centric magazine. I am still trying to have a laptop-free evening a week, to give my eyes a bit of a rest. Shopping and food During lockdown I have become increasingly averse to grocery shopping, as it feels like the most dangerous part of my week. Since lockdown started, I've reduced my grocery shopping to one trip a week (or every 8 days, recently). Prior to the pandemic, I didn't do a main shop and would drop into the supermarket three or so times a week on the way back from work. Despite finding grocery shopping anxiety-inducing, I haven't bought any groceries online, for a few reasons. Firstly, I don't need to and many others do -I'm not in a vulnerable group and have multiple supermarkets within walking distance. Secondly, I live alone and don't need to buy more than about £20 of groceries a week. Thirdly, I'm picky about food and couldn't cope with substitutions. I'm lucky that I've mostly been able to buy all the groceries I want, although there were four weeks when the supermarket didn't have any eggs. My eating and cooking habits have changed somewhat during lockdown. Having to prepare all my own meals is tiresome, as I strongly dislike cooking. However, being at home all the time has made me gradually experiment with more cooking and eat fewer packaged snacks. Since lockdown began I've been regularly making my own granola, flapjacks, and roasted vegetables. That doesn't sound like much, but it's more than I was doing before. I've also had several disasters, including a vegan banana bread so bad that it made me feel nauseous and gave me an anxiety attack. I can't tell whether I'm eating better overall, although I think I've put on some weight (which I've been half-heartedly trying to do for more than five years). I don't have scales, but my hip measurement has increased by an inch or two. I am definitely more organised about food and eating more vegetables, though, which are good. Also not eating in cafes is saving me money. I've only got takeaway once during lockdown (cheesy chips from a nearby chip shop), as it doesn't seem worth it without the social aspect and I worry about the possibility of coronavirus transmission. My anxiety sometimes makes eating difficult. I've almost always managed to eat three times a day or more, however this sometimes ends up being at midday, 5pm, and 10pm. It's hard for me to judge appropriate portions, so I usually go to bed hungry and wake up ravenous. I prefer hunger to indigestion and stomach pain; there often seems to be a trade-off between the two. I've still got plenty of tinned food from my brexit stockpile to eat, as my preference has shifted during lockdown to cooking a pile of fresh veg and eating the leftovers for half the week. There are several more simple recipes that I intend to try, however working up the motivation to do so takes time. While I have far fewer distractions now, being on edge all the time makes cooking high risk. In addition to the inedible disasters, during lockdown I've been clumsier and dropped ingredients all over the floor several times. I'm also paranoid about food going off and giving me food poisoning, a pre-existing anxiety that the pandemic has intensified. Entertainment and Leisure I haven't taken up any new hobbies, lacking the energy and concentration. However, I have rediscovered some old hobbies. I knitted a cowl in the first month or so of lockdown. I bought a folding bike at the start of lockdown, intending to cycle regularly, but have only used it a couple of times. I prefer walking, as it allows me to look around more. Since I'm in the same small flat for more than 23 hours a day, just looking around the park feels like a real treat. Spotting local wildlife in green spaces is perhaps the most pleasurable activity I've been doing. I've seen cygnets, goldfinches, herons, bats, and many ducklings within a mile of my home. For indoor exercise, I've tried doing some yoga using youtube videos, usually at around midnight. I would like to get into a regular routine of yoga before bed, but mostly leave it too late and am hungry and/or exhausted. I haven't managed any DIY at all. That would require levels of focus, calm, and confidence that I absolutely do not have at present, not to mention equipment. My main activities have been reading and watching TV and films. I haven't read as many books as I usually would, while still getting through quite a few. I keep track on goodreads and review all books I read there. Since lockdown began, I've finished 27 books. My current preference is strongly in favour of escapism, so most of them were fiction. I've also read reams of fanfiction on Archive of Our Own, as that tends to be lighter and less demanding than professional writing. I'm rewatching my favourite sitcom, Community, and have just finished the 5th series. The last thing I finished watching was series 1 of The Terror, about the loss of the Franklin expedition. That is a dark and depressing series, albeit very good, so I spaced out watching the ten episodes with lighter fare, like She-Ra and Dead To Me. I've caught up on various films I had intended to watch and have been attending an online Bad Movie Night with friends. We stream a movie using the Netflix Party chrome extension and mock it using audio chat on Discord. That's fun. I also have a longstanding arrangement with a friend living 400 miles away whereby we videochat while watching the same superhero TV shows. That has continued unchanged during lockdown, except for the topics of our pre­watching discussion. On my own, I tend to choose what I consider to be escapist and fun films and TV shows. I still have a huge list of unwatched content. Often I surf the internet or play freecell while watching video, as I struggle to fully concentrate without something to do with my hands. Knitting also works. I've got into the habit of always putting subtitles on, as these help me focus. I don't have a TV, so watch things on a laptop using netflix or piracy. I mostly listen to music on spotify or youtube, but have recently rediscovered old mp3s on my backup harddrive. Rather than learning new skills, I'm concerned that my pre-existing skills are atrophying. The only new things I've learned, really, are how to make my own granola and press buttons with my elbows. Personal hygiene My personal hygiene was fairly careless before lockdown, by prevailing female standards. I showered twice a week and didn't remove any body hair or wear makeup, for instance. It has definitely got more careless, though. I wash about as often, but don't change my clothes as frequently. I only get dressed and put deodorant on at lunchtime or later, on some days not changing out of my pyjamas at all. The sniff test is now graded more generously, because nobody is going to get close enough to smell me. I have to spend more time moisturising my skin twice a day now, due to an unpleasant eczema flare-up during lockdown. I've tried out new hairstyles a couple of times, but am mostly ignoring my hair until it gets greasy enough to need washing. I was already growing it, so am personally not bothered by not being able to get a haircut. Several of my friends are impatient for hairdressers to reopen, as they have shorter hair than me. Sleep I am a night owl by nature and working 9 to 5 does not come naturally to me at all. The sleep routine I fall into given the choice is 3-4am to 11-12. During lockdown, I have constantly struggled to go to sleep before 3am. I think I've managed it twice in the past week and can't remember the last time I went to bed before 1:30am. During weekdays, my alarm goes off at 9:30, I drag myself out of bed around 10, drink coffee, feel dozy, and take an hour long nap around 5 or 6pm. I feel most alert between about 8pm and 1am; that tends to be when I go for a walk. At the weekend, I sleep in until about 1pm. About once a week I'm woken up in the middle of the night (morning, technically) by stomach pain, indigestion, or an anxiety attack and take a while to fall asleep again. None of this is pleasant. In better times, I slept 8 to 9 hours every night. My dreams are anxiety-centric at the moment. In the most recent that I recall, I dreamed of going to visit my Nana and Grandad in their old house. They died in 2017 and 2012 respectively and I miss them very much. In the dream, I was initially delighted to see them again, then realised with horror that I could have exposed them to coronavirus and was wracked with guilt. I've been dreaming frequently of being trapped in lifts, prisons, and other confined spaces. My dreams used to be a lot more fun and exciting."

Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health to me means that my body, mind and soul are ‘well’ and are functioning properly and positively, without causing me any pain or negative side effects. Wellbeing to me means how I choose to look after myself – how I spend my time, how I look after myself and my outlook. A healthy body = functioning, mobile, painless, hydrated, relaxed. A healthy person looks confident, fit, bright eyed, animated, comfortable and moves with an element of vigour. Probably seen as a good biological mate! Not obese or too skinny. They probably exercise and sleep well and enjoy a varied, healthy diet. Like a glossy dog on a Pedigree Chum advert. I’m unsure how being a straight, middle class, white man has influenced these feelings. I suppose I can afford a good diet and I’m educated to understand the benefits of looking after yourself. Through my job I have recently been given a lot of training about mental health and wellbeing. This is probably due to the high numbers of people who were getting signed off work with stress. I completed a two-day Mental Health First Aid in the Workplace course. I was also part of a Health and Wellbeing group at work and I helped to set up a Self-Help library at work. Because of my own experience of stress, anxiety and anti-depressant medication, I feel quite comfortable talking about this. I’m sure I learned about healthy eating at school and through TV campaigns like ‘5 a day’, which encouraged people to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. My parents had responsibility for looking after my health and wellbeing when I was younger, in that they’d feed me and encourage me to get out of the house. I don’t, however, remember specific conversations. Although, I put weight on in my mid-twenties and my Dad rang me to tell me that ‘everyone was talking about it’, which I didn’t find particularly motivational. Whereas school and TV and the government were responsible for the educational messages I received. I was probably about 12/13 when my voice started breaking. As I was surrounded by other people at school going through the same thing, I didn’t feel particularly self-conscious. This is a key sign in young men – at least it’s the most outwardly noticeable. As I’ve got older, I’ve struggled with my weight and my mental health. I put on weight in my mid 20’s – I wasn’t doing anything differently – it just happened. My mental health started to suffer after relationship breakups in my late 20’s and early 30’s and then again in my early 40’s, due to work related stress. E5551 I’ve tried various diets but I love eating and drinking, so rarely stick to anything. I walk to work every day, which is roughly 4 miles. At least I did until the pandemic hit and working from home became the norm. I now have an Apple Watch, which encourages me to hit targets regarding Movement, Standing and Exercise. I now try to avoid drinking alcohol between Monday and Thursday, as it tends to affect my sleep, making me more irritable and unpleasant to be around. From a general wellbeing point of view, I like aiming for a good balance of ‘SHED’ – sleep, hydration, exercise and diet. To encourage a balanced routine, I have a daily random number generator on my phone which chooses a different activity; 1 = Lunch in front of the TV (a self-indulgent treat) 2 = Shower or bath followed by reading a book 3 = Walk 4 = Yoga This encourages me to carry out varied daily tasks that all have a positive aspect. I also use a random reminder app on my phone to remind me to drink water. To cope with my tendency to worry, I ask myself Socratic questions. I discovered this approach in a book called ‘Change Your Thinking with CBT’ by Dr Sarah Edelman. I used it, successfully, before my driving test and have recommended it and used it ever since. It goes like this; . Describe the situation you are worried about. . What specifically do you fear might happen? . Rate the likelihood that this will happen (from 0-100) . What evidence supports your worrying thoughts? . What evidence does not support them? . If it did happen, what actions could you take? . Realistically, what is the worst that can happen? . What is the best thing that can happen? . What is most likely to happen? . Are there any useful actions you can take now? . What would you tell a friend who was in your situation? . Realistically, re-rate the likelihood that your worst fears will be realised (from 0-100). I also attended a series of anxiety management workshops at the beginning of 2019, after experiencing workplace stress and visiting my GP. E5551 Because of my experiences, my awareness and the self-monitoring nature of an Apple watch, I’m much more aware of my health, both physical and mental. My work is very good at maintaining a flow of information and advice about health and wellbeing. All this means that I’m more aware of physical and mental health than I’ve ever been. I expect this to continue as I’m developing routines and mechanisms to encourage a variety of positive mental and physical activity. When I’m mentally unhealthy my eyes look slightly crazed and tired, my hands shake and I either talk less and less coherently. When I physically unhealthy I get fat, sad and less confident. I don’t think I’m influenced my popular ideals of beauty now but I did used to dress like my musical idols in my impressionable youth. This was a ‘uniform’ and a badge of cultural identity, particularly when I was in sixth form (16-18) and university (18-21). My Mum and Dad have both been influenced by health ideals – they’ve both ran in the past, for example. I would probably take the anti-depressant Sertraline to a desert island as it is a real crutch for me now and I take 100mg every day to maintain a positive frame of mind. I can’t recall my parents’ routines before leaving the house – it has been a long time since I lived with them. My Dad would definitely shave before an evening out, whereas I’m less bothered by a bit of stubble. When I used to travel to work, I’d shave on Monday and Wednesday and give my face a break on the other days. I still do this now, despite working from home for the past 9/10 months. I used to wear walking shoes/trousers and T-Shirt and would then change into crumpled shirt and trousers in the toilets at work. Now, working from home, my morning routine is less frantic. I’m here to help with the kids’ morning routine more, including taking my eldest to school twice and week. Working from home means that work doesn’t dictate my routine as much as it used to."

It means free of illness or injury. To me it means more than that.  It also means feeling good, flowing, excuding fitness. A healthy body means – strong, fit, lean, honed and beautiful.  I imagine a Scandinavian type lady, tall, tanned and blonde, with very blue eyes and very white teeth.  She is clean limbed and slim. My own experience of health and wellbeing is probably influenced by social class, due to the amount I have read and looked into it.  I also think the richer you are, the better opportunity you have, not only to eat the right foods, but also to have the time to exercise.  I try to ensure that H and I eat well. Each day we have turmeric in soya yogurt, together with oats, nuts, grains, berries and seeds.  We eat lots of greens, other vegetables and salads, as recommended by Dr M Greiger in How Not to Die.  If I was very poor and living on a council estate, I probably would not have the money to eat like this, nor would I have the interest to look into such things, buy that book and exercise.  I may be unfair, but I have experience of people from this sort of background and it is easy and cheap for them to go to McDonalds or similar takeaways.  Their parents have always done it, so they do the same. I didn’t taste fish and chips until I was a teenager.  We never had takeaways.  My mother and my grandmother were excellent cooks.  My grandmother probably even more so and she was passionately interested in growing her food and knowing what was especially good for her three daughters. My mother was responsible for my health and wellbeing and she was great at providing excellent meals, though too much meat, but that was the way then.  I didn’t need to made to eat vegetables. I don’t remember many conversations about health.  My mother would say things like, “put your slippers on, or you’ll get arthritis”.  She was a bit obsessive about us feeling cold and we were always warmly dressed in the winter and had hats, scarves and gloves. We didn’t receive any health education in school. In biology, we learned the facts of life, amid much hilarity (stifled) and drawing anatomy.  I couldn’t imagine how on earth it would work.  I do remember one girl asking the teacher what would happen if the man’s appendage got stock inside the lady and the teacher saying tersely that wouldn’t happen. “Yes, but what if it did?” she persisted as we all sniggered. I first became of bodily changes in my first year in the big school, ages around 11. Some of the more advanced girls were wearing bras and I begged my mother to get me one. We went to a little shop opposite the post office and an old fashioned wooden drawer of tiny bras (32A I think!) was brought out.  I chose a pale blue one with white daisies on. I loved it. For Christmas I received a set of bra and pants in navy with white flowers on. A7000 Everyone was very excited about getting their first period too.  After all the build up, I can’t actually remember when it happened. I was neither the first of the group, nor the last, just in the middle.  I do remember having quite bad pains sometimes and headaches. I think these are all moments that will stick on a young girl’s mind. A change from which there is no going back. A less grown up moment was my first kiss.  I was 16 and it was with a waiter in Majorca when we went there for New Year (my parents and myself). It was horrible. I have been interested since my early teens in trying to stay as fit and, I suppose, as attractive as possible. I have exercised, eaten well and looked after my skin. A big change was having chemotherapy in 2018. It was for six months.  I went from being a fit and healthy person, to an old woman. I didn’t recognize my body any more, nor could I judge how it would react to everyday things, such as food, smells and drinking.  I couldn’t walk far, some days I could barely get upstairs, because I was so anemic I had to have blood transfusions. My neutrophils dropped to zero and I was at risk of sepsis. I had infections in my eyes, which hurt a lot. I couldn’t watch TV or read and the light was painful. My skin was covered in a rash, which hurt when any clothing or bedding touched it. I felt around 90 and I really wondered if I wanted to carry on with the chemo, life was so awful. I had an insight into being an old person and I have not forgotten how that feels. I am afraid of getting older and I would like to do all I can to keep as fit as I can.  However, I am very short on time, as work takes up most of my day – sometimes 12 hours + and there is little time for anything else.  I do walk the dogs once a day and that is something, I suppose. I read a lot of things on health and well being, in the newspapers, womens magazines and online.  I also watch TV programmes. I am a firm believer in hardly any meat, not just for us but for the future of the planet. Over Christmas, when we ate turkey, some pork and pork sausages, my knees ached terribly, as did my wrists.  Now we are back on track, they are around 75% better. In the future, I want to be able to exercise more.  To do stretches and more cardio work.  I love feeling able to do this, after the terrible 6 months when I was unable to do anything like that and could barely work down the garden without having to stop and rest.. I think health and wellbeing are related to physical appearance. A glowing skin, a slim body. Surely we all want that? I have been influenced by popular ideas of beauty, like being slim, I admit but I don’t subscribe to tattooing my eyebrows or these ghastly false nails. I don’t think my parents were as influenced.  My mother did join weightwatchers and lost a lot of weight, but it came back on.  She was always conscious of her appearance when she went out.  She had been a very beautiful young woman and even to the end, had a lovely face. She had her own ideals of how she should look and had a huge amount of clothes, including ones she had never worn and was saving for best.  The influence of the war years, I suppose. I couldn’t live without acai berry powder and organic amla power. Both excellent for keeping the leukaemia at bay, I hope."

Most people I know are incredibly angry with the Government and its handling of everything. One disaster after another. It started with rumours of them going for herd immunity at the beginning of the year, when the first cases happened in the UK. The risks were minimised. We were told it was a mild illness. Johnson joking he would not stop shaking hands. Then he got it. In fairness, that was when they had started to tell people that it was more serious, but mass gatherings weren’t banned, sports were still being played. Their fear, of course, was that the NHS would be overwhelmed, as they were in Italy. Doctors there having to choose who got the chance to live, by putting them in intensive care. I don’t think it ever came to that here, or not so we have been told. The lack of personal protective clothing (PPE) for the doctors and front line staff. I accept that is probably due to successive governments not prioritising stores, but then we are told this Government are sourcing them and all front line staff will have them and special flights are bringing them in. The NHS staff saying it is just not the case and they are having to re-use equipment. The lies over the number of deaths. Only telling us the number of deaths in hospital, not at home or in care homes. Do those people not count? The office for national statistics says the deaths for this time of year are up on last year by 50,000+, yet we are told that around 37,000 have died. Then this latest scandal, with Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, driving up to his parents in Durham and lying on his twitter page, that he was self isolating at home. Spotted going for walks at Barnard Castle over Easter. He did a press conference yesterday and answered questions from some reporters, but would not express regret or apologise. Still firmly believed he was in the right and later Johnson said Cummings had behaved with integrity throughout!!!! Actually, that sums it up. Tory integrity is to break the rules, lie and think you are above everyone else. How can you tell when the Tory party are lying? When one of them speak. I started off as Conservative, but recently – and also because I dislike our tory MP, I have voted SDP. I am so glad I didn’t vote this lot in at the last election. There doesn’t seem to be any sort of a coherent plan. I think they just make it up as they go along. At the weekend announcing that the extremely vulnerables (and that includes me) are “allowed” out for an hour and to meet a person who is not a member of their household. This was announced without any consultation with any medical teams, doctors, GPs etc most of whom are furious and have taken to tweeter to vent their anger. I am not doing anything differently. I do not trust this Government and their “science”. In truth, because the village where we live has around 450 inhabitants and a lot of those are on far flung farms, I have been walking the dogs each day and avoiding anyone I happen to see. H only goes to the village shop for his Sunday paper and to the outside market once a week for fruit and veg and some fish. We’ll just continue. S, back at his flat in Brighton, is proposing to go out less. Brighton has been hit by waves of tourists this last weekend. The weather was so hot and the beaches were rammed. People were not social distancing. Here in Sawley and in other parts of the Ribble Valley, there were lots of strangers, walking dogs and children, consulting maps and going into the village shop. Hoards of cyclists and motor cyclists on the roads. H saw this when he walked the dogs and went to the village shop for his paper. He didn’t go out again and nor did I. The news at lunchtime says the Government is in negotiations with the aviation industry so that people can go on holiday and not have to self isolate for two weeks when they come back. Otherwise the travel companies will being going bankrupt. Well, they will anyway if people are dying or too scared to fly. Profit before lives. In any case, my guess is lots of countries will refuse us access, given that our death rate is the worst in Europe. Then the announcement that non-vital shops are to be allowed to open from 15 June, when 200 – 300 people a day are still dying. It seems that the Government are just trying to make it seem that everything is OK and getting back to normal. It isn’; they just have more capacity in ICU to take very ill people. One does wonder if one has had the virus in a mild form though. I had a mild sore throat and temperature for a day or so the week before lockdown and a cough that lasted three weeks. As my immune system is compromised from the chemo I had during 2018, I don’t think it could have been covid 19. I am sure I would have been a lot worse, but who knows? I am struggling more from the after effects of the car accident in February of this year and cannot get any physio or help, due to having to shield. I am also having counselling for PTSD and although we haven’t specifically talked about the current crisis, we have talked about my anxiety and how to deal with it and it has helped. I watch the news on TV and quite often the covid updates each afternoon. H, surprisingly, often can’t watch the news, he finds it too depressing. I also look at news online and some of the tweets on twitter. I worry that the covid updates each day are a lot of whitewash. I didn’t think that to begin with, but I do now, given the lies we have been fed. Homelife for H and I has not altered much, due to the fact I was already not working, because of the car accident. It has been a joy to be in the garden in this lovely weather and I am refusing to allow myself to worry about how we will cope if this goes on much longer. I mean financially. Having said that, after I hurt my back carrying in the shopping delivery last week, I have been a lot more depressed. I have aggravated the back injury from the car accident and have struggled to sleep or move easily. This has caused the PTSD to rear its ugly head again and all my fears about not being able to work have rushed at me and dragged me into the black slimy hole of despair. I try not to watch the news too much now. I check up on tweets and of course facebook to stay connected with some friends. Watching the news, I despair of the world. A black man was killed by a white policeman a week ago. The policeman knelt on his neck for 20 mins and asphyxiated him, while “restraining” him. There have been riots in lots of American cities and protests around the world, entitled Black Lives Matter. That idiot Trump is spouting off, even though the protestors were in front of the White House. He is calling the governors around America “jerks” and saying he will send the army in to clear up the protestors if they aren’t stricter with them. Meanwhile in New York, the bodies from the virus are being put into mass graves and held in refrigerated trucks, as the morgues are full. I wonder if someone will get so angry with him that there is an assassination attempt made. I can’t help but think it would be a good thing. Here, there are photos of Blackpool beach awash with litter after people were there in their hundreds yesterday. Shocking that people have learned nothing during this lockdown of how to behave and care for nature. That was the message that we hoped would follow, after seeing news footage of how the pollutions levels are down, wild life are coming into towns and the seas and beaches were clean. One weekend and it has all gone to put. I despair, I really do. I can’t help but think that God is sending us a message. We had floods over winter, now lovely weather but droughts, bush fires in Australia, rioting and unrest in America and this terrible virus over all the world. The lockdown has shown how the earth can heal and I think that is what we are being shown – stop your selfishness and destruction, have compassion and take care of the world. The first weekend out and it is back to selfish, destructive behaviour. God must be in despair and the second wave of the virus will come. Maybe even stronger than the first. If I was God, I’d make it stronger, though try to be discriminating about who it kills – the greedy, cruel and horrible people. If only. I do think a second wave will hit within two to four weeks of this slackening of lockdown. I fear that what we have experienced in the last ten weeks is the tip of the iceberg. I sit here in my kitchen typing. The French windows on the balcony are open and I watch the goldfinches on the feeders eating niger seeds, sparrows and robins pecking at fat balls and a blackbird taking a drink from the bowl I have put out. The garden is very green, despite the drought. The air is full of bird song, but the horrors of world situation are not far away from our little sanctuary. Lots of people have started to use zoom etc to keep in touch with friends and have virtual meet ups or indeed meetings for work on line. It doesn’t really appeal to me. I have talked to family and friends on the phone and exchanged emails and that has been fine. Staring at someone or several people on a screen in an attempt at socialising just doesn’t appeal. Our Sainsbury delivery arrived today. I alternate between Sainsburys and Tesco, that way I can get two deliveries a week in. One friend of mine goes to Tesco once every two weeks! She must be incredibly organised. I find it hard to work out the menu for a week and usually forget something. At first it felt like Christmas when the delivery arrived, now it is a pain. It all as to be disinfected outside before it can be put away and sometimes they have made substitutions that I really don’t want. We were told that outdoor markets can re-open now, which came as a surprise, as Clitheroe has never closed. Not that I have been, but H goes of course and we want to try to support local business as much as we can. Our eating habits haven’t changed. I have always cooked pretty much from scratch. Lunch is homemade soup in winter and salads in summer. The salads have a mix of leaves, plus grated carrots, nuts, seeds, beetroot, chive flowers, herbs and usually an egg from one of our hens. In the evening, as we are pretty much vegan, lots of vegetables in various dishes. H gets his fish dish once a week at the weekend, with a nice sauce. People talking about having so much more time and learning new skills or hobbies make me feel inadequate. Or cross. They must live in bloody little flats or houses. I still don’t have enough time to do what I need to, but there again, being injured again and unable to do much with this bad back, makes things difficult. Having said that, the garden is the best it has been for a long time. I have, for the first time, had enough time to prick out seedlings, grow things on properly and harden them off, before planting out. We are hoping for great things in a little while, when everything starts to bloom. Plus, we are pretty much on top of the weeding! Our plot (including the house) is four-fifths of an acre, so it is quite large for the two of us to manage, especially as H is waiting for a new knee and struggles and I have this terrible back now. There doesn’t seem to be much on TV. They have put some more films on and lots of repeats, but often I can’t be bothered with them. I watch Bargain Hunt every lunchtime while I make our salads. There is going to be a dearth when the social distancing ends, as no new programmes or films are being made. Yesterday was my birthday and I did feel upset at my inability to go out. Prior to the lockdown, wehad planned on meeting S in London, having a nice lunch and going to the National Portrait Gallery. Last year, when I was 60, we met S in London and had lunch at Fortnum & Mason, which is my favourite shop in the world. Then we went for cocktails at The Savoy. A few days later, H took me to Le Manoir Aux Quatre Saisons near Oxford. He had even booked a four poster suite. It was wonderful. We stayed in Lincoln on the way back and that was lovely too. Then a few days after that, a friend had booked a surprise birthday party at the Waggon and Horses in Bolton-by-Bowland. After all that, anything else was going to be a bit quiet, but I never thought it would involve being in our house and garden all day. It would have been lovely to take the dogs with us up to the Lakes for a day and have a pub lunch at the Drunken Duck and a walk around Tarn Howes. It was not to be. Instead H had made a lot of effort and bought me some lovely presents and a fabulous card. It was actually a Christmas card he had spare! He couldn’t find a decent birthday card, as those shops are shut, so he amended the rather beautiful “Happy Christmas to my lovely wife” card, by putting a label over Christmas and writing Birthday. He then made up a touching poem and stuck it over the Christmas wording inside. What a darling he is. We facetimed S. I had made myself a birthday cake and sent S a third of it last week, so we could eat birthday cake and drink tea together. It is always a joy to see him and talk to him, but not as good as him being here, of course. H had also ordered afternoon tea from a local bakery, which arrived beautifully packaged. He knows it is one of my favourite things! That fed us all day and we had some champagne at night, but by bedtime I felt a bit hollow and sad. We are still in separate bedrooms and bathrooms, as per the instructions for extremely vulnerable people. I have been sleeping a bit better recently. I went through a terrible time of not sleeping and lots of anxiety and nightmares. I think the counselling I am still having by phone has helped me deal with anxiety and so sleep better. Sometimes I don’t mind sleeping alone, as our sleeping patters are different. H sometimes want to go to bed later than me and he always gets up later than me. I prefer separate bathrooms. H isn’t showering as much as I do and sometimes he doesn’t shave for a few days. I am strict with myself and shower/hairwash every other day. On the days I don’t shower, I have a good wash. To be honest, I don’t feel like it and it is a surprising effort to do it! It would be easy to just not bother. I am strict with my facial care too, toning after cleansing and putting on serum and moisturiser, as well as special eye moisturiser which I pat round in the morning to drain the lumphatic system around the eyes. I don’t look that great, but I’m sure I’d look a lot worse without it. A few days ago I had a try at touching up my roots. I am still blonde (ish) at the front, but the chemo has made my hair darker at the back! I had sent off for some organic hair colour, which was bleach free. It took me ages to do, as I was trying to do just sections as the hairdresser does. It really made my arms ache and I got fed up with it in the end. When I washed it out afterwards, it looked darker than when I had started! Walking the dogs down the road, there were a few motorbikers siting on the tables by the river. One said something to the others and they all turned round to look. Well, I thought, he’s either said what has that woman done to her hair, or he’s said “have you seen the size of that German Shepherd? What a beautiful dog” In hindsight the latter, as our W gets lots of admiring comments on his looks. He is a golden sable German Shepherd and I have yet to see another dog as big as he is. He is 29 inches to his shoulder and those shoulders are huge and powerful from all the swimming he likes to do. One of our neighbours always says the dog looks like an extra from Game of Thrones. He is also the gentlest and sweetest dog I have ever owned."

This is very much related to Everyday Health and Wellbeing This morning I was recalling that the last 2 years I found and shopped for Christmas presents for my grand daughter outside of the area where I live which is the shrunken geographic area that Covid boundaries have created. When she was 1 I went to Oxford Street ,to John Lewis and found a Peppa Pig drawing board which she still uses a lot. Last year I was in Whitecross Street, E.C.1 and found a lovely little purple silver cross pram which still also still uses a lot. I went to our local Lidl yesterday having seen a light in their magazine that she may like. My daughter came with me and we decided against it but the point is that after buying her a dress in Sainsbuy’s on Friday and then Lidl yesterday I realised my boundaries are smaller, nearer. I haven’t minded too much. I’m older and to some extent this happens anyway. But no, that’s no excuse. I thought of going to Southbank, which I haven’t since last March and is closed, Barbican where I’ve been been twice since March. Its not a physical feeling of deprivation but it is growing into something. (SEVERALWEEKS AFTER WRITING THAT on December 28th I RECOGNISE THAT IT HAS/had,GROWN INTO A FEELING OF SEVERE CONSTRAINT, ,just the desire to get out of the area becoming huge and tension filled. Yesterday it was somewhat relieved by a journey in a car to take my daughter to hospital to the maternity unit to check on her unborn baby’s movement and her partner, their 3 year old and I spent a couple of hours in a different park.Unexpected out of the ordinariness. I have bought more plants and flowers for indoors, window sills and and balcony I missed the seaside, visited a friend once after lockdown in Ramsgate, travelled by train, my summer holiday in total. I have missed travelling around London, England, Europe, anywhere I have missed libraries, public and the British library I have missed parks and gardens I have missed sauna’s and swimming, I swam 4 times between lockdowns I have missed seeing people I like I miss exhibitions and galleries, I have been to 2 galleries and one temporary exhibition H-2418 I walk around seeing the last flower vestiges of summer and autumn, dahlias, yellow roses A major occupation is eating I walk everyday to the park, reservoirs or local field, taking my grand daughter sometimes who is 3 I do Chi Gung most days, in a class sometimes, once to twice a week, previous non Covid time teachers mostly online or with class recordings online although I went to a sports centre between lockdowns November 26th 2020 I am going through some of the books I carry around and write in and in the one before I am using now I find this note /poem I wrote on June 20th 2020. In the field at Gillespie Vetches have taken over from lupins At 8.08 am it’s too late to feel alone A black and white cat comes to play And I play with my stone Bad temper Wondering the difference between accepting and allowing I am sick of being penned in by Coronavirus Walking everywhere within a small radius That which is repetitive becomes unseen I see a slow worm on the poster and remember it’s name they insisted it was a snake I’m glad it’s written down How much longer no buses and trains How much longer death tolls rise In this country, Europe and throughout the world This transition is dangerous since freedom is a goal A gaol is only a feeling away or is that a letter H-2418 I allow the deaths but I do not accept them The cat returns, I smile The guardian of the stile Allowing people to pass. So many have passed A man picking up rubbish stops to chat, We talk of restrictions And freedoms. My stomach churns and rumbles I rise to go. And another June 24th 2020 Life continues in Lockdown The last day of the heatwave Stationer’s Park Crouch End awaiting C who I arrange to meet no sunscreen on the shoulders tomorrow a storm Saturday rain Life continues in lockdown meeting C got me here on the last day of the period of heat. Spacious dog barking numerous steps a green waving flag furls itself around a pole. An uncommon tree wafts in the wind. The particular poem that I include next was written on April 6 which was two days before I had a suspected TIA which is a Trans Islamic Attack or a mini stroke that at various times in the road H-2418 toward a proper diagnosis was said to be either that or a very unusual migraine. I have written about the experience and the follow ups etc. Stress is something I suffer from, indeed we all do but has caused problems for me in the past, does now and will probably continue to. But here’s my experience 2 days prior, In some altered fashion The world turned and many days and nights shifted round before spiralling seemed endless The world caught in a multi layered trap of its own making its victims martyred We who were we became I but not the I of United spirit the I of aloneness. In myself I grew antipathetic to my neighbours not kinder as was suggested and bothered by it This morning as I rose the birds rose with me the magnolia bloomed at its height the seeds of depression sprouted Imagine, in early spring entrapment called all our names with a blocked nose and headache I feared the worst My daughter had a new cough even before the light broke through the runners had regained the world On the phone my London friends complained of this I recalled in Finsbury Park one woman running up the hill making excruciating noises and raised her hands passing me with exclamatory groans Old people walk in the road to avoid them Serotonin highs blinding all good sense, runners not old folk My exaggeration prone to irritation fashioned itself in growing fury as I considered that even early morning now was not my own The wetlands closed, soon it would be parks and anger would overspill the streets where runners would gun us down With laboured breath and focused fight we should equip them with megaphones H-2418 and insist the running track be opened Where they could queue And crouch on blocks and let the aged walk in peace Or perhaps we could have the lanes marshalled like in the supermarkets super strollers out for a daily dose Beneath a pure blue sky embracing freedoms like an ability to walk and breathe without fear of being mown down. Ranting over I'll go out past noon when the workers work perchance, dog walkers midday walk on leads now their creatures and the grassland clear. Criticism of bikers left till another day, another tirade How many old folk will tally in Corona’s list knocked off a pavement socially undistanced by a focused mind? April 6th 2020 I sent it tongue in cheek to a few friends and put it on my website and still some responses still ring true. The reason that I include those poems is as a kind of measure of what was happening to me mentally after lockdown and prior to the TIA. A measure of my health, my nervous system and mental health particularly and then with the Neural event the physical effect of stress which was definitely implicit in this time of covid. My mental/emotional well being has been challenged and that continues in a way that cannot be divorced from the lifetime. Is it the end of the Covid experience? Willr be an end to the Covid experience? there eve There was great programme on BBC Radio 4 Pattern thought, thought pattern, relevant to wellbeing, OCD, poetry. That was a while ago, its now December and I have an intention to finish this. It is winter, autumn long gone and spring far away. THE ABOVE SECTION IS ALL COVID RELATED AS EVERYDAY HEALTH AND WELLBEING HAS BEEN OF PARAMOUNT CONCERN AND WHAT FOLLOWS IS MORE TO DO WITH PART TWO OF THE DIRECTIVE >>>***<<< And now to the questions:h has energy at it’s disposal in all phases A healthy body is one which has energy at it’s disposal in all phases of life even though this may alter over the course of a lifetime and when different forms of nutrition are ingested, exercise is performed, restorative sleep is part of the cycle. H-2418 Energy Breath Strength Contentment. I see a person doing yoga (although actually I do Tai Chi and Chi Gung now). In warrior pose in fact, arms extended, one leg stretched the other bent, rooting down into the ground through the feet and reaching up to the sky through the head…..The image you asked for.ought up in a working class household my parents paid for me to go to ballet classes which was great but I doubt Identity. I think its inevitable that may experience will have been influenced.Brought up in a working class household my parents paid for me to go to ballet classes which was great but I doubt if they would have afforded to send me to riding classes even if I had been interested. My brother played a lot of football but I doubt that I would have as a girl in those days even if I had been interested. My daughter did both of those as a child as there was a riding stables her school friends attended and a local sports centre were football and trampoline were offered which she did. She was an only child and Had more of a middle class upbringing in that respect. She chose Irish dance and judo and they were available in the community. Irish dance was available in mine but I wasn’t 2nd generation Irish or interested enough and really liked ballet so that’s what I did. I answering this question from a childhood perspective which is where influence is at it’s strongest. Growing up and learning about health and well-being Being aware of illness is what I first think of. Having illnesses are some of my first and earliest memories.Being in bed with my sister having scarletina, on my own with measles. Being told to eat the food in front of us as it was good for us (and to think of those who didn’t have sufficient food, in Africa for example, who I often said were welcome to mine). A friend just called and I asked her the question about health and well-being and she said she became aware of health when she was 18 and had an incident of depression as indeed I did to in different circumstances. She became aware of physical health when she was in her 30s and started jogging and sandals and started the ruination of her feet. I just asked my sister when she phoned what health and well being mean to her. She too became aware of health when she was a child because people were being ill and she thinks that health is the recognition of freedom from illness. Our parents looked after our health as children. I expect our paternal grandparents did too as we live so close by. I can't really remember much conversation about Health when we were children, my sister and I had the girls magazines Judy particularly and then I had Jackie when I was a teenager and maybe there was some stuff in that one about health but I really don't remember. I remember when I had my first period my mum coming upstairs where I was lying down and starting to talk to me about periods and I said I'm not pregnant am I which shows how ignorant I was and she thought that was very funny and continued to tell the story for many years after. First bra came between the ages of 11 and 13 probably closer to 11 and I remember getting a bra and my friend being there when I put it on we were very excited I thought we were very grown-up. My mum came with me to buy the bra. My mum also came with me to the doctors when I was 16 or a little bit older maybe 17 at the most to get the pill. I remember telling the doctor I wanted to go to India and him saying that I must sleep with Indian boys. H-2418 For many years I danced so as a child doing ballet, then dancing all night as a teenager staying out on Saturday nights when I was supposed to be staying at somebody else's house. Coming back to dance in my 20s and dancing as a profession as a teacher until I was in my mid 30s. Such a pity I'm not still dancing. I did tai chi and for years I did yoga. After dance I swam almost every day I've always done some physical exercise this morning during our hated Covid Tier 4 I went for quite a long walk. I have become increasingly plagued with stress, when stressful things happen I am less able to deal with them than I was when I was younger but somehow I think that this runs in our family and maybe from a neurological point of view rather than from a nurturing sense my mother always had trouble with her ‘nerves’ I can no longer take St John's wort when I am depressed but still take tincture of oat for anxiety. When I was 18 I had a particular experience whilst living in Holland and that was the first time I was ever really were aware of being depressed and I think it came about from living with Dutch people who all spoke English and I did not speak Dutch and found it difficult to even make a beginning in learning. But the experience was of a sexual nature and I think I suffered a dissociative episode as a result of it which ended after a period of travelling when I return to Holland to the house of someone that I really cared about and who cared about me. He is dead now. Another Dutch friend rescued me from a bad relationship and I am likewise very grateful to her. All those rituals that you mentioned are important obviously but at this moment I can't think of any others. The first period and bra I have just told about. GROWING OLDER I have both stopped drinking completely and smoking completely in order to maintain my health, both mental and physical and I'm very very glad I did so, this was in 2000 on New Year's Eve so on Thursday next I will be celebrating 20 years of this. It came about as a great desire to do so and I which made me very determined and giving them both up completely was paramount since cutting down its not a good idea for some people, including myself. I get information about health and well-being from everywhere, the Internet, my friends, the news, the radio, the television, myself, hospitals, yes everywhere. Yes yes I am more aware of my body now as I grow older, when it breaks down it does so in a way that takes me longer to recover, I am much slower than I was I get much more stressed much more easily and I am very aware that at 68 I am on a trajectory towards my end so it's important I stay as healthy as possible. I am overweight, not obese but heading that way and I suffer from anxiety more than I ever did. I am in close touch with my family yet see my friends much less, in fact not at all because of Covid. I have no idea how I expect my approach to health and well-being to change. Health, well-being and appearance Health and well-being are related to external exposed appearance in that you can see when someone is well and when they are not. I include myself in this I would've thought that by now they would have had those scanners that we can just walk through like at airports that would show up disease. MRI scanners are much better and I expect that scanning will take huge, huge, huge leaps forward in years to come. H-2418 There is no-one who can remain uninfluenced a popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance and it is better that people know they are being influenced than are influenced unconsciously. When I was much younger I would be in stores in Oxford Street and glance in the mirror at myself and be very disconcerted and discontented. The older I get the less bothered I am about how I look in terms of prevailing culture and fashion, in fact fashion is something that I have come to deplore because I see just how influenced people are and how much that is often to their detriment. I have a real distaste for celebrity and celebrity culture these days influences people much more than it should and I really welcome the time when its demise arrives. People are never influenced or rarely influenced for the right reasons, usually it is because someone needs to make money out of them. It's not always the case but I deplore its prevalence in the world today. I remember when I was 14 and had a first boyfriend I had gone to a friends house and asked her to cut my hair she was much older than me and was a hairdresser by profession I had very long hair at the time and she cut it very very short and it looked great. I went to meet my boyfriend who didn't recognise me at first and when he did said oh you look like a rabbit. My mother cried when I got home. I kept that hairstyle for quite a few years. I am sure my mother has been influenced by popular culture she was a great seamstress and made clothes for all of us herself and her two daughters for all of our lives sometimes using the same fabrics for three different styles of dress, I wish I had been prouder of her at the time. Looking at the directive now health well-being and appearance don't fall into a natural triad. Oh so find it hard to see how the question what would be your desert island item falls into this directive but obviously whoever put it together does. My parents married in 1945 and would've been very influenced like all other, almost all other working-class people by the fact that the national health service came into being. When people didn't have to pay to see the doctor or for medical interventions I think that they would have taken better care of themselves because they were able to afford it. That seems to be an omission from this directive the fact that we have a national health service which helps us to care for ourselves and to remain in good health and influences us every day, in almost everybody's lives. It would influence the population, one sound reason why people would want to come here if they had a choice of countries to emigrate to. The national health service is that which we have most reason to be proud of ourselves as a nation. I think the efforts to privatise it will all have been carried out by people who have money and without much thought for those who don't. Look at everything that Obama tried to do in America by bringing in health care for everyone. This is the basis of every day health and well-being. Health care for everyone delivered as a response to need. WE are blessed in being cared for by the NHS. Getting ready to leave the house Before my father left for work every morning at seven he laid lit the fire. I imagine he did this before he had breakfast when he himself was having a cup of tea. He would get dressed in his working clothes as he worked fairly close by at the local tannery. He was a maintenance man there and he worked there for 40 years, he worked very hard. In the evening he worked in a pub to make extra money which was actually to make enough money to keep the family of mother father and three children and also to have a social life and be able to have a drink. Before my mother went to work she would take care of our needs. We all went to school before she went to work. There were 5 of us in a very small house. I imagine though hardly remember that she’d pack us off then get herself ready and go out to work for half a day, shop and then come H-2418 home. She had various jobs before she was paralysed after a brain aneurysm when she was 42 prior to that she did many different jobs during the war, in her youth she worked as a seamstress and she may have done this afterwards also. She also worked as a cleaner in a furniture shop for several years on the main street of the town that we came from and lived in and that they lived in for all of their lives. This town was Bolton which at that time was in Lancashire and is now part of Greater Manchester. This town is where the middle-class observers went to observe the working-class northerners.I am really glad there is still a good collection of photos there. Essentially this is why I remain a Mass Observer myself. I am retired now but my routine would have involved a bit of meditation perhaps not formal and whilst still in bed and then reading in bed usually whilst having a cup of tea before I got up, got dressed ,collected anything I needed to take to work and off I would go. Long after I had a child in those days of course she would be the priority and the one I would get ready first in the mornings before I would go to work and take her to school. And now she's having her second child in six weeks time, her first child is at nursery which has been severely disrupted because of Covid. I'm sure health and well-being have been severely disrupted in everybody's lives because of Covid. This is in fact like the disruption of the war that our parents lived through, my parents anyway. Death everywhere on a grand scale. My grandparents lived through two world wars and that must've been dreadful. And what a world we are living in. Climate change now affects everybody's lives whether they recognise it or not, whether they care or not our health and well-being depends upon the recognition of the world and of the governments of the world doing something to slow it down or halt it before civilisation as we know it now ends rather than impacts in the way that it is now by Covid 19. The threat of Covid overhangs the world as does the threat of climate change."

I have been watching the WHO Assembly.I think they are great and its a brilliant organisation. My health A short while ago, it is now May 20th and the date I refer to is April 8th, I had a strange neurological occurrence when I suddenly couldn’t remember my daughter’s name and then when I did find it on my phone .It was not Covid related but I needed help. Actually I wrote something about it that I will copy and paste in here now. And also I think my balance is awry, Freedom shouts loud daily and I always hear it. A week ago I had a brain event -an occurrence whilst doing 3 things semi simultaneously, activities, the worst of which was listening to the (f.w). government doing their important missive stuff even with the PM having had his own Covid visitation. I was booking and paying for a webinar, and looking at a text asking after my daughter was so I thought I’d better phone her. But I couldn’t quite remember her name. Her first name came but together with her surname it didn’t seem quite right but I phoned her and the words I needed were’t quite there.I had a headache by this time and she sensible woman that she is took me through the stroke set up which I remembered I knew then sent her partner round with asprin since she deduced it was not a stroke but a TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) We talked from a distance, he sitting on my front wall and me from the window and I regained my right word speech though his description of our initial communication belies the writing. My daughter and he swapped, he went to look after my grand daughter. The paramedics came and my speech with effort was precise, just to prove the point. They took my very high blood pressure several times and were very nice to me, talking in their ambulance and I remembering the last time I’d been in one with my friend P onn his final journey to the Whittington. She came from Australia the lady and told me how she and a friend from the same town ran into two others from there in some far flung place. They had wanted to take me to UCH or the Neurology hospital but couldn’t for some reason. This was the farthest I’d travelled in three weeks having started shut down on Tuesday March 17th. Not locked down though, still free but under daughter’s orders to be safe. My last weekend an art class, a jazz concert and Kew gardens, full to overflowing with communication. The paramedics dropped me in the Green Assessment assessment area (which I newly discovered is the Non Covid hospital coding) to be cared for by B and L then the marvellous Ambulatory Care where I was tended splendidly by Nurse S, named M at birth then renamed by a sister who couldn’t say her name.Tea on request, biscuits on request. But still high blood pressure and a CT scan which showed possible damage because of the blood pressure.I still had a headache until a couple of doses of paracetamol and a long read of Ferdinand Pessoa’s book of Disquiet which I picked up deliberately before leaving the house. I came home in a cab, looking at Archway as if out of prison bars. Archway resisted for so many years, only just, but not this night in walking distance, quiet streets. The doctor was lovely too. At home I sat in darkness for 10 minutes before going to bed and a deep sleep. Two journeys, but being in the hospital too was freedom since social distancing was at an end with treatment and communication at less than 2 metres. This was unlocking the cage and as close to the normality of no distancing I’d had in quite a while. Even seeing people I knew well in the park was better outside than in but many arms lengths away. Next day a long chat with a neurologist who said someone would phone with an appointment for scans. He thought it may have been a form of migraine I hadn’t experienced before rather than a TIA. His secretary would phone with an appointment to come in for scans. It may be a problem in my neck. I’m still waiting. I’m still waiting, not without proactive chasing though at daughters insistence.Chasing my tail in circles. They, I think it was they sent a survey the day after the phone chat with the head honcho of the stroke department. I wasn’t sure it was from them and was in such a bad mood, so irritated with everyone and everything that I put the phone down. I’ve left messages galore, galore, a lovely word. I’m glad I have. I’m rather tired. But here I am in the garden. Writing this, free in a way. Locked in in another sense would have been terrible. I’m not wanting scans in Queens Square but they are probably needed and several days later than anticipated. I look forward to getting out of the hospital where I won’t have to see anyone and walking home through a central London I can only imagine, I, lover of London Christmases, empty streets too often crowded and noisy. Another potential taste of Freedom. I should be thinking i’m lucky. and now i think of it i AM. YES, I AM, Here, still here, in my garden writing this to O and able to say and think, I Am I sent a card to thank them at my local hospital, they were very good to me. London Christmases, empty streets too often crowded and noisy. Another potential taste of Freedom. I should be thinking i’m lucky. and now i think of it i AM. YES, I AM, Here, still here, in my garden writing this to O and able to say and think, I Am April 16th 2020 Phase 2 Much anxiety about all this although as an undercurrent, more aware of headache snd posture and tiredness and the going from one to ten with no space in between, in getting irritated, afraid, het up, tense, stressed. The phone calls I made elicited nothing. I email the address attached to the phone number I’m given by the hospitals appointments line. To no avail and yet the doctor who rang me said I’d receive an appointment in a few days. Round and round and then falling to stillness until my daughter picks up the lifeless stick, gives me a different email and I retry the email address with a letter’s difference and different phone numbers and I run another circular path. She got fed up and wrote to them using her college address and title of Dr. There came a response in less than an hour. The power of hierarchy! She may say the power of clarity, thinking I always say more than I need to and could be clearer. The differences in personality, different characters , abilities, deficits , this all comes out in the writing and doesn’t make us who we are but shows us something about ourselves and others. The doctor rang and talked and questioned me and said his secretary would phone me with an appointment the next day which she did. My sister listed all the things not to forget and suggested I use a dictaphone, my phone much clearer than any I’ve ever used I discovered and he was very acquiescent to the idea in the situation. I resented the suggestion though when she made it but I was very grateful in the end. I It felt like an extra thing and our prior conversations had led me to think he may baulk at the idea so I would need courage I didn’t have. My sister is so organised and had years of this kind of situation with my parents so knew what she was talking about, a third ear for invalids and the aged. Look at that word that was in our vocabulary for so long invalid, invalid, not valid, a person becomes ill or damaged or disabled and they are invalid. Yes it's still current, still there in the dictionary. I listened back today to the recording and it could neither have been clearer or less indicative of the emotive conflict I sensed but perhaps was all in me or between us but in an understated way. I recall my emotions I don't really know his only their expression as interpreted by me. I had ordered a cab and before I left I was filled with fear although apart from not finding things I was looking for I didn’t know why. The MRI didn't thrill me certainly or talking to a hospital consultant that hadn't followed through on what he'd said previously and he seemed in an irritated hurry from the sound of his voice. The cab came and M drove,£18 for the trip, I hadn't met him but he was friendly, chatty and kind. The Hospital was disorganised, intermittently. I followed instructions, was shown the MRI room, the flowers on the sanitiser bottle in the loo making an impression at each loo stop I made. The was her name, older, kind, welcoming, her name she told me on hearing mine was A , shortened to its present form. The MRI was excruciating though she said it was a very fast machine, the sounds loud but interestingly repetitive, when the technician asked why I liked it, it was easy to compare with minimalist genres I love and he understood. As I left I said there is another scan due but she said it hadn’t been ordered so the doctor would look at this first. Captive memories form, are those where a stranger has made a positive impression as she did. had told me to go to. Why shorten a beautiful name like that to one the host nation can handle? As I walked down I saw a man on the phone outside the centre who I thought correctly was the consultant. Looking back I think he reminded me of Dom Joly. I went in, had blood pressure taken and temperature, by a young man who gave me a mask and apron. The whole corridor was filled with Chinese students, laughing and being hospital close which as I’d already discovered at the Whittington is as it used to be , no 2 metre spacing here. I waited, and waited and then was told I would have to have the other scan, as I’d been informed the previous day. I went back and met with A who started to walk me to another bit of the building whilst we chatted. The assistant from before told us someone else was to do the scan, she said goodbye and I waited. The new technician said hello and asked me to wait again which I did, someone else asked for my hospital number which I didn’t have, I called my daughter although he said he’s find it soon then everything was fine and the technician invited me in. It was an interesting scan all around my neck with cold gel and then interesting conversation about how B became attracted to this work. He wanted to do something in the medical field looking radiography he came across the sonar aspects which really attracted him and the proper name of which I now cannot recall. Then I went to see the doctor. It was called a Carotid Doppler. I have been trying to remember the name for this so that aspect and of course it's ultrasound. As I was writing it made me very anxious that I couldn't remember it as this was a facet of the event on April 8 but it's also a facet of the ageing memory and anxiety seems to be operating differently in me now than I have known it previously, seems important to note this, it seems important that I am kind to myself and give myself time. I am 68. I live in the world. I am taking my own blood pressure for the first time in my life and that is provoking anxiety in itself and I can perhaps work with this, learn how to manage it, but isn't the feeling of anxiety which is worst is that something is terribly terribly wrong. And knowing the difference as perhaps a matter of insight and understanding and isn't kindness and important part of this? I asked could I record the conversation he was very happy to do that and when I tested it later in the day I realised I had a very good record although I was too squeamish at hearing the sound of my own voice and recalling some of the emotions to actually play it until the next day when I listened in the sun in my garden and was very pleased indeed that I had it. Emotions really was that there was a conflict between us and me wanting to make very accurate the story and him wanting to get it done. I could feel a kind of tension but then when I played it back it all sounded very reasonable indeed, if I say now that he had his elbows on the table with his hair flopping over his hands making the idea that my friend was too long rather insignificant although I cannot wait for M to start up again to get mine cut. Conversation started with him recalling our conversations prior and in retrospect he was very skilled at making the conversation both meaningful in the recording in all senses for me and for him. He couldn't say for sure if I had had a TIA, he couldn’t say and the other possibility was that I had experienced a rare migraine another possibility, he checked my eyes and my ears even finding wax but no other problem and at the end asked I has assistant which was on a kind of iPad and then I went to have blood taken by a very skilled person I asked was he a haematologist and now he was a phlebotomist whom I interpreted as a lobotomist which I later thought was very funny. The doctor did say there was a widening in the artery in my neck and they would have to keep an eye on that, some months down the line. Then I went to see someone to do a heart trace who I asked could it measure anxiety and he replied yes and when is it was finished nothing major that would be interpreted by the consultant who had also told me that when it was possible I would have one of those three day heart measurement things. The conversation the two of us had was really pleasant. We talked about where we live what we each know if those areas how are you got to work which is funnier than what I'm writing, involving how NHS staff are being treated well at the moment and have the gates at Vauxhall are easy to pass through. His name is K. Is because he is still there so the experience has gone. One of the things that was important about the conversation I first had with Dr S was that he was speaking in the present continuous and I had to ask him you're talking about the event about what happened and he said yes I was like I was being pedantic, I don't think it helped our communication. I left after that, talk to E on the phone and walk to Brunswick Square where some of the shops and all of the restaurants were shut. Waitrose didn't have what I specifically wanted so I bought loads of yoghurt for E, M and me. I walked through Brunswick Square Park, so flowers I no longer recall and the sunshine was marvellous. I walked on right down to near King's Cross remembering when M and I walked along there in the very noisy very dirty early afternoon when she was in the buggy and I was trying to get her to sleep. I called the cab firm I use, it seems sweet to me that my details come up when I phone as if they know me just from these hospital visits.I said I'd meet the driver at Caledonian Road pool giving me enough time to walk some more which I did happily although he was a bit impatient when he got there before me. The cab cost £12 and the drivers name was A and I was very happy to go to sit on my balcony in the sunshine. Of the million things that I have forgotten what is important now is that life is up-and-down, things come and go we don't know when something is over we don't know when something is terribly wrong or if the imagination is just having full reign upon the body but because we don't know does not mean that something is happening or not, something is always happening it seems. The high blood pressure that appears to be happening now I would rather were not happening and hyper vigilance is at once a small price to pay for looking after oneself and something of a thorn, a weapon, something not understood. I wrote this, phase 2, from April 23rd on April 23, but I don't think it's over yet, there seems further to go, I'll take 75 mgs, or a junior aspirin a day. In the words of the doctor, a phrase from my past, a junior aspirin which I can see in my memory in a box with lots of colourful children on the front, stick kids in pink and blue, turquoise, something I'll see in a Pharmacy at some point. This morning I've suffered from anxiety again and it's passing, has passed. Is it a byproduct of what's going on? I don't know but perhaps it's the end of phase 2. Phase 3 I’m still waiting for that letter, the appointment was nearly a month ago.The doctor said take my blood pressure a couple of times a week as it seems to be ok so that’s what I’m doing although I get anxious just thinking about it. Today it’s 130 over 80 first call. Second call its 117 over 72. So that’s ok although I DO WONDER ABOUT THE MACHINE AND I CO-ORDINATING WELL or is that me co-ordinating badly. I don’t know actually, certainly nervousness affects me. May ?? So that was the event as it occurred to now. I’m feeling much better. My daughter emailed for the results of the tests that I had on the day at the hospital as its a month since I had the whatever it was. May 20th 2020 On May 29th it still hasn’t arrived. June 12th 2020 It came sometime in June so far. My doctor changed the aspirin I take for another drug.I have to take my blood pressure couple of times a week. For the moment this is how it continues. The Neurological hospital is supposed to have me back in for a three day heart trace but I imagine we’ll have to get back in touch with them once again once the horrors of Covid are abating. Abating because I listened to the WHO’s media briefing. 41, 279 is the figure of deaths in this country. That’s a horrific figure. Perhaps I will join this number, perhaps you will. I hope not. Today (July 4th) It’s almost 45,000, the death rate. If anything is taken from my directive return it is this consciousness of this it should be that. This is the health issue of now. The death caused by the pandemic. Our Government Our government is SHIT, yes SHIT. They are arrogant to have acted they way they have, they have blood on their hands from the sheer incompetency of the lack of action. I deplore the prime minister, the secretary of state and the health minister who I would rename ………………………. The steps they should HAVE taken are to have been testing and contact tracing since the very beginning and locked down earlier. Shut down the airports earlier and allowed no-one into the country who wasn’t returning for lockdown and then tested them at the airports. Likewise anyone leaving for the sake of other nations and tracked and traced their contacts. Willfully ignorant is my austere judgement of them. I’ve had arguments with others that say they have done their best but as it has been so dishonest they ought to have joined together with other parties and worked on behalf of humanity and not their selfish selves.I’m glad they ploughed money into the furlough and peoples livelihoods but the death rate is far, far, far too high. May 29th 2020 The Dominic Cummings debacle has been going on for a week. Last night one of my neighbours had a huge party, not sure why birthday party perhaps but social distancing was nowhere in sight. Another neighbour rang to see if I knew which house it was and I didn't tell them because I didn't want them calling the police because if Dominic Cummings can break the rules then everybody can and well and though it is sad and not the right time to end social distancing, maybe it never will be, if he is not going to be thrown out of office then I certainly don't want any of my neighbours castigated in anyway. The two situations may not be comparable but Dominic Cummings makes the rules, he is the power behind the throne of the Emperor who wears no clothes. If he could drive nearly 300 miles in March to take his son to relatives there my neighbours can have a party as far as I'm concerned. June 12th Tonight I went to the shop at about 8.45 for some milk and realised I hadn’t been out in the evening for months, yes months. The security guard in Sainsbury’s asked me where I’d been and I told him I’m awake at 6.00am and usually go to bed about 10.00. I used to go out in the evening . I’ve had enough now, of the virus, of this directive.Of the government lying and being incompetent. Most people I know don’t listen to them anymore and like me get their news elsewhere. I go to the WHO, one friend reads the Guardian twice a day. Tomorrow single people can see their family again in a complicated bubble game. I went into my daughter’s flat yesterday for the first time. Her partner came here and changed a battery in a smoke alarm in my very high ceilinged hallway. I am listening to piano music. I listened to a music more at the beginning of all this. I love piano music. I’m sick of the media, I’m sick of speculation. I hope I am not sick. I meditate on zoom every day for an hour and a half with my teacher and a group. Sometimes I go to Satsang to another teacher based in another country, on Mondays I do a webinar of another non duality teacher. All this is great. I’m dying to get on a bus or a train and go to another area. Here’s another poem I wrote early on, getting very pissed off with the runners everywhere. Some of my friends agreed. In some altered fashion The world turned and many days and nights shifted round before spiralling seemed endless The world caught in a multi layered trap of its own making its victims martyred We who were we became I but not the I of United spirit the I of aloneness. In myself I grew antipathetic to my neighbours not kinder as was suggested and bothered by it This morning as I rose the birds rose with me the magnolia bloomed at its height the seeds of depression sprouted Imagine, in early spring entrapment called all our names with a blocked nose and headache I feared the worst My daughter had a new cough even before the light broke through the runners had regained the world On the phone my London friends complained of this I recalled in Finsbury Park one woman running up the hill making excruciating noises and raised her hands passing me with exclamatory groans Old people walk in the road to avoid them Serotonin highs blinding all good sense, runners not old folk My exaggeration prone to irritation fashioned itself in growing fury as I considered that even early morning now was not my own The wetlands closed soon it would be parks and anger would overspill the streets where runners would gun us down With laboured breath and focused fight we should equip them with megaphones and insist the running track be opened Where they could queue And crouch on blocks and let the aged walk in peace Or perhaps we could have the lanes marshalled like in the supermarkets super strollers out for a daily dose Beneath a pure blue sky embracing freedoms like an ability to walk and breathe without fear of being mown down. Ranting over I'll go out past noon when the workers work perchance, dog walkers midday walk on leads now their creatures and the grassland clear. Criticism of bikers left till another day, another tirade How many old folk will tally in Coronas list knocked off a pavement socially undistanced by a focused mind? April 6th 2020 It is July 1st 2020, Going back over the writing I pick out ad add in these since they are all reactions to the governments. It is July 1st and if anything I am more angry about them, sad about they deaths and dismayed at their terrible handling of the situation Reactions, responses to government edicts April 27th 2020 1. They are giving the survivors of those who have died on the frontline £60,000 They they is the government The NHS chiefs, powers, those in power Because that power didn’t buy them PPE Didn’t co-ordinate with Europe Didn’t communicate and thus they are murderers What’s £60,000 when your husband has gone? Your mother is is dead? Stay at home, protect the NHS Save us the trouble. 2. A nice smarmy' stay at home’ advert Where all manner of isolates Make hay in joyful forms of communion And then sadly, ring a ding, it turns out To be an advert from McCains The same vein. 3, June 26th 2020 Further down the line Ant and Dec Are on a nice little earner bringing People together on another set of constructs It is annoying turning off the government The adverts.The only salient piece Of information is the death count Today it stands at 43,464. It is July. I remain dismayed, the dates are those of the writing of the poems. May 18th 2020 The health psychologist Susan Mickie Is answering questions, she’s smiling, Why is she smiling? When she’s telling what the WHO have advised And what the English government did not do. II’s Mental Health Awareness week Those people make You want to scream and tear Your hair out Like devils dressed in suits and cards These are our feigned advisors She broke my heart, smilingly telling how We should have been following the WHO And not saying we have not. 2. They are murderers 37,048 deaths Making rules for others that they don’t follow Sublety is lost driving miles for lobelia (J) taking a bus to Marks (L) looking after a small girl (me) Those who make the rules are not serious about protection of the others. Relatives cannot see the dying friends cannot go to funerals Staff are run ragged without protective garb This government has murdered thousands of people Because of their arrogance and stupidity I blame them I really do June 9th 2020 Over 40,000 dead now George Floyd’s funeral huge In death he grows, the stature of (a titan) “I want to touch the world,” he said, and has. July 5th 2010 Over 44.000 dead now. In less than a month over 4,000 people have died. News reports talk of excess deaths. I presume they mean a rise on what is normally expected to have occurred. All the care home deaths are excess deaths in the way I would term unnecessary deaths.Old people gong into hospital and being sent back to residential and care homes without having been tested. Bank and agency staff going into care homes after leaving other care homes, not having been tested themselves because there was no testing in place, there was no PPE in place. The fact has emerged that 2 years ago even with knowledge of Ebola and Sars and Mers the NHS cut back on stocks of PPE. Similarly there was an investigation into what what would happen in a pandemic and was any of the information implemented? No. Teresa May has criticised the present government Did I say I hate the government and their incompetence. Let me say it again louder, with no irony. 40,650 DEAD.. We need humility said the head of the WHO yesterday. They have suffered from the sin of pride and so have we in consequence.This government are in fact murderers and I hope they are severely taken to task when this is all over. They have not listened to the WHO or learned from any other country. And as I read this again on July 5th there are over 44,000 dead. Any of your friends and relatives? No? You are lucky! Yes, I am very sorry, perhaps their death was unnecessary too. Work and home life I am retired so don’t work anywhere apart from at my writing and my voluntary work is reading to someone I met and read to as a volunteer in hospice.I do this over the phone and since lockdown every day for half an hour or so or a couple of chapters. She is shielding as she has COPD equivalent since childhood and is on oxygen all the time so not getting out at all. It’s a 2 way street as I sit down and enjoy the read and she rests and relaxes. I live on my own with my daughter, partner and grandchild round the corner and they are a lifeline. I’ve been seeing them before today which the official bubble making day. Did I say I hate the government and their incompetence. Let me say it again louder, 40,650 DEAD.. We need humility said the head of the WHO yesterday. They have suffered from the sin of pride and so have we in consequence.This government are in fact murderers and I hope they are severely taken to task when this is all over. They have not listened to the WHO or learned from any other country. Since writing this my daughter has discovered that she is pregnant. She has had a private early scan since she has experienced miscarriages. It cost them a lot but the NHS is not doing reassurance scans. She will have to isolate again at 28 weeks. My work has often involved reading and writing and work and leisure are the same in retirement and there has been a great lessening. I read every day to a friend who was originally a patient in hospice.I think I have written this somewhere else, we are reading 2 Adventurous 4 books, reading one we read some of previously and have 1 more to go. We have read 3 famous five books prior and three Moomin stories prior over the period of lockdown.She has breathing difficulties and finds breathing hard and being read to very soothing so I phone her every day between 12 and 2. As that suits me. Technology I am so thankful I have a decent computer and a smartphone, I don’t know what I would do without them. I do lots of things on zoom but particularly meditation (think I said this before) every day with my teacher and a group from 4-5 15/20 wish except Sunday as I would have done previously at his house once a week. It’s been great. I join another non dual teacher for satsang, a spiritual meeting (you’d never know from the vehemence of my anti government rants would you?)that’s on zoom On Sundays I join another group for philosophy. Again we used to meet in per"

A healthy body is balanced, fit, able, okay, content. No particular person comes to mind Identity My own experience has been influenced, being male but more feminine has made me feel inadequate, I am overweight, cannot afford particularly healthy food. All of these do influence my health, especially class with my lack of access to healthy things, be it exercise, food, therapy, wellbeing measures, space, fresh air and more. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When I was young, but didn’t learn of mental health and wellbeing until a lot older. My parents looked after my health and wellbeing, they talked to me a little bit about it. Talking about sunscreen mouth ulcers, drinking, smoking etc. Did also get education in school, but I learnt from many other sources, probably most from the internet and my own research. Key moments Can’t remember a particular puberty moment, again shaving and voice breaking, these rituals are physical but the heralding of them is all a construct which is rather arbitrary. Acne was a bit of an anxiety aspect Growing older I focus a lot more on mental health, mindfulness, writing poetry, photography, fresh air, walks (less due to Covid). Overall it’s gotten worse, I smoke, I don’t drink as much as I did at Uni, I get less sleep due to work. I eat better, but also at times worse, but overall better. A lot worse since starting full time work. Still get a lot of health and wellbeing info from the internet and my own research. I’m more aware of my body, but less able to explain aspects, I hope I get into a better financial situation and I can take better care of my health. I’m suffering greatly in this situation. Health, wellbeing and appearance They are somewhat related, but aren’t totally aligned, for example mental health is isn’t related to external appearance, but yes, there are many things that are physical that can indicate better or poor health. It’s complicated. I have been influence, I think everyone has been influenced, I feel a bit shy about my hair loss, only at 25, about my weight and lack of visible muscles and hair thinning, so, typical anxieties for a guy/non-binary, but although anxiety his me sometimes worse than others, most of the time not so much, because of being demiromantic demisexual if people focus on the physical then I am usually not interested. I’ve only found one person not focussing only on physical attributes rather than on a person being an actual person. Of course my parents were influenced, probably not in the same way, the influence is greater now due to pervasive images on social media and not only movie stars and models, but influencers, YouTubers and many people that this generation feel as ‘friends’ rather than models to be looked up to. Truthfully I don’t have a beauty project that would be a desert item, only cleaning products or stuff for hygiene. Getting ready to leave the house I cannot remember so much their going out rituals. The ritual for mine is to have a shower, deodorant and mostly that’s it. Tying my hair up and letting it dry there before untying it. I used to use more hair gel, but now my hair is longer and I have lost some of it is thinning which has given me more recent anxiety."

Health is something we are each imbued with-or not-as the antithesis of illness. To be healthy, however, is contextual to each of our physical states, with maximal levels set by the pre-existence of a disability, or by a person’s age. Being healthy is indeed also related to the cultural context in which each one of us frames our health. As I age, I would say that my perception of what it means to be healthy has altered from being truly functional at 100% capacity (not cognisant of my physical self, because it is functioning so well), to recognising that living with some minor aches and pains is a normal part of the day-to-day. The concept of being healthy is also linked very strongly to my actions-what I eat, how much fresh air I get, the exercise that I take. My healthiness is a much more active choice than my health. ‘Wellbeing’, by comparison, is a broader and more inclusive term than includes physical and mental health, almost verging into something outside oneself-a broader sense of peace and contentment. A healthy body is well nourished, of reasonable weight (neither skinny nor overweight), smiling, gently tanned, reasonably muscular but not ridiculously so, and well rested. My view is incredibly ableist and a bit fatphobic, to be frank! Without a shadow of a doubt, my view on health and wellbeing has been shaped by my experiences of who I am. Being genetically slim has fed into my fatphobia. More generally, maintaining the ‘right’ weight (curvaceous, but not skinny) is pretty much a walk in the park for me. I get a lot out of exercising (and am conscious how much it improves my mental health, which can be decidedly troublesome) and like my physique more when I do. I grew up a white girl in a country filled with other white girls. I have never really been conscious of judging what my body shape looks like versus that of others in a negative way for myself. Quite simply, I do not see the relevance of body shapes in the media and magazines for my perception of my own. I feel as though I have a good sense as to what being healthy and happy is for myself, even if I do not achieve the mental health axis of this very consistently! I have no idea when the concepts of health and wellbeing first entered my mind-likely the former before the latter. I suppose one thing I do remember was my mother hiding the weighing scales from the bathroom early in my teenage years as she was worried that I would be inclined towards anorexic (thankfully, this never happened. I love my food.) My parents were responsible for my health, but to be honest I do not remember them saying much about it. What lodges in my brain more is our school nurse asking us how much we ate crisps and chips! To be honest, the 1980s were a very different era for what was deemed healthy food than now. I certainly do not remember learning about health and wellbeing from friends or magazines and the internet was not something I had access to until my middling to late teens. Even then, it was dial-up and it simply did not cross my mind to seek out anything on health, bodies, celebrities or fashion that might have altered my perceptions. I had my first period at 13, when my Mum was in hospital being treated for cancer. I cannot recall if this was before or after my mother took one look at me one day and decided I needed to start wearing crop tops (I quickly talked her into bras instead). I suppose this was my first conscious knowledge of my own adolescence, but even then they did not lodge, as it were. I had no real sense of my adolescent changes being a ‘thing’ that was particularly exciting or annoying. It simply happened. I suppose such moments mattered to other people and am particularly cognisant of how dreadful they must be for transgender or non-binary folk, if during your teenage years they force you even further now a route for which you want no part. This feels like an even more live issue after the Supreme Court’s ruling on puberty S5767, female, 35, married, Gravesend, academic researcher blockers before Christmas. In my 20s, I started cycling in order to commute because it was quicker and cheaper than the other options and meant I actually got some exercise. Later on, partly as a result of doing in my back, I added pilates into the mix. The pandemic has dramatically changed all this-I knew no commute meant a high risk of me not exercising at all, so I switched to running every weekday morning instead of cycling and later added in some use of the rowing machine to try to maintain the tone of my butt (cycling being very good for it). This exercise definitely does me good in terms of both mental and physical health-I have a distinct horror of being a physically unable old lady and want to do all that I can to maintain my physical health whilst it is still easier. Pandemic times have also meant that I have taken up counselling to help with my mental health, after a truly horrible patch in June after years of on and off depression and anxiety. I am probably more aware of my physical self than I used to be, partly because I do a lot more to maintain it, as well as the need to work at my mental health. I hope that all of these positive things can be maintained, even when I go back to the office. My information on health and wellbeing comes from an odd mix of scientific papers, the NHS/CDC/ECDC/WHO websites, and various people’s ponderings on positive things for mental health on Twitter! It helps to know quite a few people who are neurodivergent in terms of the latter, you get wonderful and well-curated content. My own sense of my health and wellbeing are in no way related to external markers by which other people could perceive my status, but I recognise that, when it came to describing a healthy body above, I went straight to such markers! Pot, kettle, black. Oh dear. I do not set a huge store by conventional ideals of beauty and trying to impose them on myself (being content to be middle of the road, as it feels like a waste of time that could be better spent doing something else to put in the effort to be otherwise). I also likely strongly judge especially women who seem to put in ‘too much effort’. This probably reflects the views of my parents quite strongly. I do, however, recognise that a lot of this is because I ‘pass’ easily in society as a thin, vaguely blonde, white girl. No effort is required to scrape by. On the counterargument, I like my curves (various people have complemented me on them) and work to maintain them. Saying this, if abandoned on a Desert Island, I would like to take some Heads and Shoulders with me, as I have been using it for about two decades and have a paranoia that I will get a lot of dandruff without it! As the child of two unemployed parents, going out for work or of an evening was not really a thing for them. My morning routine has changed substantially this year, but currently consists of-climbing out of bed, followed by breakfast and putting on sports gear, morning run, shower, brush hair, stretch out my back, stow dirty washing, make hot water bottles to keep me warm in the office, start my working day. Before the pandemic, getting up varied depending upon whether I was working from home for the day (as previous, but no running), commuting to Scotland (no running, no hot water bottles, breakfast only once at the second train station), or working in Scotland (breakfast once at the office, no running, no hot water bottles, cycling to and from work)."

What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? To me ‘health’ means keeping my body and mind in good condition and providing them with the things they need to thrive. ‘Well-being’ is a more over-arching concept that includes this and other aspects including the emotional and the environmental. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. A healthy body is one that receives the correct fuel to perform all the necessary functions to live. It is in balance. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. I don’t think there’s a particular person. It’s more a feeling of someone being well-balanced and happy in their own skin. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Unfortunately, as a woman I think that over my lifetime health has mostly been presented in terms of how much you weigh and your bodily appearance. As a naturally pear-shaped child from a working class background I experienced constant negativity about my size and appearance. As a teenager in the 1970s I was not thin, and therefore I was considered unhealthy and told to diet. (Not by my parents I hasten to add). Adults, who should have known better, seemed to think nothing of making hurtful remarks. For me dieting meant eating next to nothing and feeling ill. I played sport ­hockey, tennis, netball -and was very active outside of school, but as I was never going to be the H7289 ‘ideal’ shape I still suffered from the name calling however hard I tried. During all this time I was, in fact, quite healthy and very rarely sick. The effect of this on my ‘wellbeing’ has been life long. Even now, after all I have achieved, I still suffer from crippling self-doubt, hate putting myself forward and have to fight hard to overcome depression and anxiety. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Both my parents were great believers in children having fresh food and lots of exercise. They didn’t use the above terms when I was young, that would have been later when I was in my teens, and things like healthy eating and a good diet were discussed more. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My parents. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? It was generally my mother, and we would be at home. We always ate as a family and both my parents encouraged us to eat fruit and vegetables. We knew these were good for us, as was milk and cheese. My father and uncle both grew vegetables and fruit. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? At school health advice tended to be part of other classes such as Home Economics and Sex Education. This was between 1972-79. I read a lot of magazines and spoke with friends. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I was probably between 12 and 13. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? When I was a teenager it was definitely first period and shaving. I also remember a lot of talk going on in the girl’s changing rooms about pubic hair, which seemed to be of great significance at the time. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I hated getting my first period. It was the end of the world and I’m sure my mum got quite fed up with me complaining. Growing older H7289 Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I’ve been active for most of my life and enjoyed lots of sports. Unfortunately I had to give up tennis due to a wrist injury in my teens, but I still swim whenever I can and enjoy walking. I’ve always found gardening and being out in nature very good for my mental health, and enjoy reading. As my main work is writing and researching this keeps my brain active, and also helps me to relax and escape from daily pressures. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Books, science journals and practitioners. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? Having had a few minor health issues, and cared for my mother during the three years before her death, I’m much more aware of my body now. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I don’t expect it to change much now, unless I receive medical advice. I think I’ve reached the point where I now do what I need to do in terms of exercise and diet. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? They are integrally connected. Eating the right things and exercising gives the body what it needs to create healthy skin and hair, and strong bones and teeth. Without the right fuel the body would be undernourished and this would be reflected in a person’s appearance. Lacking certain vitamins etc can, in turn, affect a person’s mental health and overall wellbeing which may lead to other difficulties. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Honestly yes, although it was never successful. I’m not built that way. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? I don’t think they were. They came from a generation that didn’t have the money to be influenced by things. They could only dream. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Factor 50 sun lotion. I burn very easily. H7289 Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? I remember sitting at the top of the stairs and watching my father shave. He was very slow and careful about it. I remember the smell of this aftershave and how he dressed immaculately in suit, shirt and tie. My mother always went to the hairdresser before a night out. Her hair had become every fine after her third pregnancy and she hated it to look ‘flat’. Depending on the age of her perm it might be for the full works or a wash and set. My parents were always well-presented. It didn’t matter that we didn’t have much money. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? At the moment, of course, my routine is minimal. Washing and dressing. Sometimes, when I go out to get the shopping I might put on some foundation. When I went out to work I got up and showered every morning. Dried my hair and put on makeup ­I always went for a minimal, natural look which took very little time. I had a strict routine and knew what I was going to wear the night before. When I started working from home this routine differed slightly in that I didn’t worry about the makeup unless I was attending meetings, and my dress style became more casual. When I’m volunteering I wear old clothes as I get involved in cleaning and this can involve working at height or on the floor."

Health body 5-words: Energetic, active, balanced, well-fed, fit There is no particular person that comes to mind, but my idea of a healthy body is one that allows you to be active, and to go about your daily business comfortably. It is about what it allows you to do, not what it looks like. Identity My experience of health and wellbeing has probably been influenced by my gender and sexual orientation in that I grew up with women’s magazines and so have absorbed (and in some cases rebelled against) what these promote a straight woman should look like. I have also had the benefit of growing up being well fed with a balanced diet, and my family has not had to worry about where our next meal will be coming from. This I feel will have had a positive impact on my health. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I can’t pinpoint when I became aware of health or wellbeing. My maternal grandfather had Parkinson’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, so I became aware of illness possibly before health, and was aware of the exercises he would do to cope with this and to try to keep himself mobile and active. My parents (and more specifically my mother) was responsible for looking after my health and wellbeing when I was young. Their approach was one of balance and moderation rather than abstaining. I can’t remember specific conversations and certainly not around losing weight. Although both my parents smoked my sister and I were very much discouraged from doing this (and both parents tried to stop smoking). We did receive education about nutrition in school as part of home economics classes. I do not remember any reference to sexual health. Most answers to questions would have come from magazines, friends and family (particularly mother and grandmother). Key moments I remember my first period starting, and was aware that it would happen and what it meant, but it was still a shock. I also remember buying my first bra. This was probably prompted by me after noticing more girls in my class were starting to do this. Neither of these things were treated as rituals or momentous events, rather they were just natural changes that happen. Growing older As I have grown older I have tried to remain a healthy weight and retain flexibility. (A healthy weight to me has always been one where I have felt comfortable rather than a particular size or weight). I have done yoga on and off all my life (my mother did Tai Chi) and enjoy walking. R7156 I try to maintain a healthy diet (limiting sugar, red meat and saturated fats) but also try not to be too ‘faddy’. My approach, especially as I grow older is to try to incorporate exercise into my daily routine so that it becomes a habit. As my father dies recently in his early 80s after quite a few yars of slow decline whch seemed to be mentally rather than physically driven (he lost motivation and became depressed) I have put more effort into trying to ensure I remain connected to the worls and to try to take steps to sensure my mental health and apacity stays healthy and positive. Health, wellbeing and appearance There is a limited relationship between health and wellbeing and external appearance, although I do not think that this equates to thinness. I think it is almost impossible not to be influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. I am glad to have grown up in a time (1970s and 80s) when popular ideals of beauty seemed more obtainable and more related to people’s (womens’s) actual appearance. I don’t have any health or beauty products that I couldn’t live without, but my Desert Island item(s) would be sun screen and mascara. Getting ready to leave the house My father worked in engineering, so like many people that didn’t wear  a shirt and tie for work he would always be well-dressed when ‘going out’. My mother would also wear full make-up and be well-dressed whenever leaving the house, including just for things like picking us up from school. I have absorbed that ritual and would also always wear make-up (at least foundation, mascara, blusher, lipstick) when leaving the house. This has changed this year during the corona virus restrictions, and I initially stopped wearing make-up entirely. At first I thought that this make-up free approach would continue in the future. I am now beginning to re-assess this and am looking forward to wearing make-up again to go out as I have realised it is something I enjoy and not something I feel I have to do."

My favourite form of exercise is walking (which I did most days pre-lockdown). Since lockdown began I generally only go for a walk once a week (and this is usually in conjunction with food shopping). This reduction is mainly because I feel somewhat anxious or ill at ease when out, which detracts from the pleasure I usually take from walking. So rather than potentially permanently associate anxiety with walking, I have cut back on this exercise. My husband falls within one of the higher risk categories as he takes an immune suppressant drug as part of his Crohns disease treatment, and luckily he has not experienced a flare up of his condition over lockdown, so has not required any medical help over the period. We neither have had any mental health issues, beyond a general anxiety about catching or passing on the virus, and the low level boredom of lockdown. My widowed father, who is in his early eighties, does however seem to have become frailer over the period. He lives independently, but does seem to be finding it more difficult to look after himself. This seems to be a mental health rather than physical issue, as he has become more isolated. I do speak to him every day on the telephone and visit once a week to drop off groceries, but I am worried about the effect the continued isolation will have long term (and whether there will be support in place to help him in the future). The government On the whole I am not impressed by the way in which the government has handled the situation, and think that other countries have been more successful in doing so. I am also not impressed however by the quality of political scrutiny from the media in this country, which seems to be based more around point scoring rather than proper scrutiny. Despite the rhetoric from all sides about ‘all being in this together’ as a country we seem to be becoming more and more polarised, which I think is potentially very dangerous. It is hard to predict, but I would imagine that the UK government will take steps to get people back to work. I am not fundamentally against this, as I think without this so many small businesses will disappear. What I do not have confidence in is that the government will do this in a planned manner. News I listen mainly to the BBC Breakfast news, and read the Guardian online and have started to buy a hard copy version of the Sunday Times. I also look online at the Robert Koch Institute and the WHO websites for reports on Covid19. I have not watched the 5pm government broadcasts, although I did watch the Boris Johnston broadcast from the 10th May on catch-up the following day. I am not aware of anyone who has had access challenges, but do support the use of a BSL interpreter. I have noticed that a number of other countries (including Scotland and Wales) do this, and think it is indicative of a lack of inclusiveness that the UK government broadcasts do not do this. Work and home life My experience of work during lockdown is perhaps different to many, in that I have gone from working part-time (2 days per week) to full-time work. This is because a new project has started during the lockdown period. I was not intending to work full-time but was concerned that the original project might be put on hold, and I was not sure, under the terms of the project contract if I could be furloughed. As it happens, the project has continued throughout and I have been working on it from home. This has positives and negatives. I am glad to have the additional income, but it has reduced my flexibility which actually feels more important now as I have some caring responsibilities for my elderly father. Although these are not onerous they are more difficult to carry out in the current situation. I also had made a conscious choice not to work full-time, so this is taking some adjustment. I do realise I am luckier than many, in that I do not have to carry out working from home alongside home schooling. My husband and I are used to spending our days together as we shared the same workspace in the past too, so there have not been too many additional challenges on this front. The inability to go out has raised some challenges, but we are lucky to have a large enough house so that we are not ‘on top of each other’ all day. There are times when we do get irritable with each other, but this is to be expected and we both try not to take things to heart. Technology I have had an increased use of technology, both for work and socially. For work this has been in the use of Zoom and Microsoft Teams to carry out meetings. I have also used Zoom as a way of ‘meeting up’ with groups of friends. This social use has helped greatly in dealing with lockdown. My husband has been using Skype to keep in contact with family in France and across the UK, and we both use WhatsApp and text to communicate daily with friends and family, sharing jokes, snippets of news and reactions to the lockdown and the government’s handling of the crisis. We have not taken part in ‘sing-along’s’ or online quizzes. Shopping and food We have been carrying out a large shop, driving to a large supermarket, about every 3 weeks, with a weekly visit to a more local shop for items such as bread and milk. The large shop has not been too stressful; although it is not enjoyable (I did previously enjoy browsing and taking my time). We have had to queue each time, for about 20 minutes, but the queue has been well managed, and people have been respecting social distancing. I have not worn a face mask, but do wear plastic gloves to handle the trolley. We have not used online deliveries. Initially this was so that those more in need (key workers, those shielding) would have a better chance of getting a delivery slot. As time has gone on, we have decided that a visit once every 3 weeks, respecting social distancing and sanitary precautions should not unduly compromise our health or others. Our cooking habits have changed slightly. We now cook more elaborate meals mid week, and my husband has taken the opportunity to try out more recipes. Our meals have stayed about the same health-wise, and we have tried to stay away from unhealthy snacking during the day. We probably do eat more snacks in the evening (e.g. some crisps or cheese and crackers) than we would normally do. Entertainment and leisure I have not done anything new that I would not normally have done, but (prior to working full-time) I had more time in which to do it. I have taken part in online sewing webinars, and am in the middle of doing a MoMa fashion course via Coursera. The time spent on this has been made available as I would probably have been out walking or ‘wasting time’ browsing in shops. I have been watching DVDs of Miami Vice, and films on MUBI. We have also watched Schitt’s Creek, Ozarks, Bosch on Netflix, and Seinfeld on All4. I have also watched ‘classic’ films on BBC iPlayer. I read every day. Currently, I have been tending to read ‘golden age’ crime stories. I had started re-reading Orwell’s 1984 as lockdown started, but had to abandon this as I was finding it too depressing in the current circumstances. Personal hygiene My habits have remained the same on the whole. I am not changing my clothes as often as they are not getting as dirty as they are not being worn outside. I have stopped wearing make-up. I would normally do this every time I went out but have now stopped. I think that I will probably wear it on far fewer occasions in the future, as I realise it had just become a habit rather than something I wanted or needed to do. Sleep Initially I was sleeping much better than normal, as I think I had a focus for my anxiety (COVID19) that could be managed (by taking the suggested precautions). As lockdown has gone on the anxiety about COVID19 has become ‘normalised’ and I have been sleeping less well on some nights as old anxieties have come to the fore. I know that my sister who is a more anxious person than I am generally was also sleeping much better at the start of the crisis. I have not had any COVID19 related dreams that I remember, but one of my friends has and continues to have, where the virus is something that is following her around."

Part 2. Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Casting my mind back to when I did my nurse training, we were taught that health is ‘more than just the absence of disease’. That good health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing. Defined in this way, wellbeing is seen as synonymous with health. But I think that ‘wellbeing’ as a concept distinct from health, or often paired with it, is something we have seen used increasingly over the years. It perhaps suggests an active pursuit of health, doing things that will make us feel good and that are pleasurable. The first five words that come to my mind associated with “a healthy body” are: functioning, nourished, strong, renewal, mine. Identity Surely our gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation must influence our experiences of health and wellbeing, whether we’re aware of it or not. Being a white, heterosexual, middle class (I’m wincing at labelling myself by class…!) woman, along with certain cultural norms, gives me advantages in my access to health services and in my health and wellbeing. For example, as a woman, I’m more likely to seek healthcare than my male counterparts. As a white woman, I am half as likely as a black woman (in the UK) to be obese – I was shocked to see this disparity in the figures released from Public Health England last week. There are no complications for me in taking up cervical screening, but for a trans man who has a cervix, that must be difficult. For T and I, having children was straightforward (in terms of conceiving and pregnancy and birth); for same sex couples who want children, their experiences will be very different. There will be multiple ways in which my identity affects my health. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have no idea when I will first have been aware of these concepts. But my mum had wanted to be a doctor and, when she found that path blocked, she worked in a hospital pathology laboratory. When she did teacher training later in life, biology was her main subject during the training (though she went on to teach infants). Health (and illness!) would always have been topics of interest in my household and Mum had books on medical topics. Mum was the person primarily responsible for my health and wellbeing when I was young. I don’t remember conversations about health when I was young, but Mum must have educated me about health. She would have told me why it was important to clean my teeth regularly, for example, and I was taken for regular dental check-ups (and fillings when needed – my own children didn’t need any fillings, but I was a child of the ‘60s and no doubt had too much sugar, and maybe not enough fluoride!). I wonder what information I might have got from my sisters too, who were nine and eleven years older than me. I do remember being fascinated by a diagram in one sister’s biology book – one she had had to put together herself, which had flaps to lift to show internal organs! I was educated in road safety as a young child. For a time, when we lived in London (so before I was seven), I was a member of the Tufty Club, which was a hugely popular club designed to teach children about road safety. Tufty was a squirrel and had other animal friends, teaching us about road safety. I think I was taken to a church hall for meetings of this club – my memories of that are very hazy. I certainly had a Tufty board game. Later on, there was the Green Cross Code road safety campaign, and I expect I saw tv adverts about this. We did get some health education in school, though I have few memories of this. I remember a dental health session, where we were given disclosing tablets to show up the plaque on our teeth. In the first year of secondary school (a girls’ grammar school), we had a couple of sex education classes. Our male biology teacher went rather red on the top of his bald head and left the class, to be replaced a few moments later by a female teacher! As well as the explanations of relevant anatomy and physiology, there was a question box, where we were invited to post anonymous questions for the teacher to answer. I wonder now how much we already knew. I don’t remember any one significant conversation or other source of information about this. Friends and teen magazines – ‘Jackie’ especially but there were plenty of others I read when I could, like ‘My Guy’ and ‘Blue Jeans’, were probably my main source of information about things relating to puberty and adolescence. I loved those magazines! This was all long before the internet. Also popular in my class at school was a book, ‘Are you there God, it’s me, Margaret’ by Judy Blume, in which the main character and her friends discuss and agonise over the kind of things that preoccupied us, like starting periods and getting a bra. I don’t remember coming across any discussion of illegal drugs, oddly. Maybe that wasn’t mentioned in school. I guess it might have featured in the tv programme ‘Grange Hill’, which was perhaps another source of information for me about teen health and wellbeing issues. Key moments I’m not sure when I first became aware of bodily changes associated with puberty. They were much discussed among us girls at my all girls grammar school, and there was status that went with having breasts (bigger was regarded as better!) and having started menstruating. I was late with both, not starting my periods until I was 14. I was in a hurry to get breasts but had a long wait! I find it strange, looking back, that when I did start my periods it was months before I told my mum, yet she was unembarrassed and straightforward about these things; I don’t know why I would have felt shy about it. I would certainly have told my friends and would have been pleased that I’d started, at last! The teen magazines’ problem pages too were full of puberty-related problems and I no doubt got some information (and probably was influenced in my attitudes!) from those. I don’t really know which moments or rituals are significant for young men, having not had brothers or sons, and no close friendships with boys before I left school. Among the girls I knew, I’m not aware that there were any rituals around beginning menstruation or getting the first bra when I was a teenager, and when my daughters were teenagers we didn’t mark these moments in any way, but I know that these things are marked by some people and in different ways. My mum remembered being taken by her Godmother to get her first bra; her Godparents were sad to be childless and Mum had a close relationship with her Godmother. Growing older I think I’ve always done things to actively maintain my mental and physical health, though in my youth my focus was probably more on my physical health. I suspect that the way we think about mental health, and certainly the place it now has in conversation, has changed a fair bit in my lifetime. I’ve always done things for enjoyment, because they make me feel good, relax me and so on, but I doubt I would have thought about this in terms of doing things for my mental health. I’ve done plenty of things that have benefited my health, but not necessarily with that being the primary aim. For example, I did some sports clubs after school because I enjoyed them, and as a non-driver I have always walked a lot to transport myself from place to place! In terms of things done for the purpose of maintaining my health, the types of things will have changed over time. When I first moved away from home I lived a short train journey away from my sister and would often stay with her for a night or two. This was a time (1983-’87) when aerobics classes were popular, and I would sometimes go to hers with her. I sometimes swam in those days too, as we had a swimming pool in the basement of one of the nurses homes. I don’t think I did a great deal of exercise during those years though, as I was on my feet all day on the wards and did other things with my time off! At university, I played the occasional game of squash but didn’t do much exercise I suppose. At different times since I have done dance classes (flamenco!), and a variety of exercise classes, including Zumba and Jazzercise. I haven’t been terribly good at sticking to it though. When we first went into lockdown, last March, our Jazzercise classes moved online, and that was good for a while, but there were sometimes connection problems, and I decided to stop it after a few months. For the past four months I have been doing a weekly Pilates class online, run by J, with whom I did my nurse training, and she then trained as a physiotherapist. I’ve started this with a view to maximising my musculoskeletal health, conscious that my body is ageing and wanting to do what I can to stay healthy. I’m enjoying it and feeling the benefits. I am very aware of, and grateful for, my good health. Over the past couple of years, I have found that one knee is sometimes sore, and my hips can be painful during exercise. I had a one-to-one online consultation with J, as I wanted to understand what I should and shouldn’t be doing in terms of exercise and these weak areas, and that was really helpful. I intend to keep the Pilates going as long as possible; I’m fortunate that I can afford to pay for such things to benefit my health. I’ve always tried to eat fairly healthily, whilst also being rather cavalier about eating sweet things. I have tried to curb this in recent years as I have put on weight with the menopause, though I’m still a healthy weight (according to the BMI calculator). I did different things in pregnancy to benefit my health and that of my babies, beginning with taking folic acid supplements pre-conception to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the baby. I was very conscious of what to eat, and avoid eating; hazards in pregnancy from other things like disease transmitted by farm animals, and did pregnancy yoga classes in my first pregnancy. I was very healthy through both pregnancies and enjoyed being pregnant. I am employed by the National Health Service and work for the UK centre of a global organisation that produces summaries of health research, and I write about health evidence, so I am immersed in information about health! I also have the knowledge and skills to think critically about health claims – in the media, for example. Personally, I will sometimes use the NHS website for information about health. For example, that was my first port of call to find out the latest information on which symptoms should prompt a Covid test, and how to get one. Aside from particular times, such as pregnancy, I think I am probably more aware of my body now than when I was younger. Being a nurse gave me a heightened awareness of health, and an appreciation of my good health, as a young woman. But at my age, I see contemporaries with poorer health and indeed I’m very aware of the gulf between my health experiences and those of my husband over the past decade and more. I’m also aware of the changes in my body through menopause and the need to work harder at maintaining my health and wellbeing. As I age, I hope I will be able to keep doing things to benefit my health and will enjoy good health for a long, long time. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think external appearance does have an impact on health and, in particular, wellbeing. We know that things like skin conditions, scars and prominent birth marks can negatively impact people’s mental health, confidence and self-esteem, along with many other things that depart from the rules of symmetry or beauty ideals, from things that fall within ‘normal’ (very large or small breasts, for example, or a prominent jaw) to those that are related to syndromes or the loss of a limb, for instance. There can be few people who are completely free of influence from popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance, though this will vary between cultures, between people and in oneself at different life stages. Changes over time relate to aspects of fashion – hairstyles, make-up, clothes and so on. But also to shifts in our understanding; the use of thin female models has been slow to change but the fashion industry has been criticised for using models who are too thin, because of heightened awareness on eating disorders – both in terms of the beauty standard they set and the problems of anorexia amongst models themselves as well as those who aspire to look like them. It’s becoming more common (though the change is slow) to see mainstream brands use models who are older, bigger, or – occasionally – have visible differences, such as models with Downs Syndrome, though the latter is something I’ve only seen in children’s modelling. I’m sure my parents too would have been influenced by popular notions of beauty and physical appearance, following fashions in clothing and hairstyles, cosmetics or grooming habits. My desert island item would be moisturiser for my face. I don’t mind which brand, but my skin feels so dry without it. I could live without it of course, but I’d prefer to have it! Getting ready to leave the house Mum would always make her face up before work and sometimes I would be chatting to her while she did it. Not a long process. Moisturiser, foundation, face powder, eyebrows plucked as needed and enhanced with a pencil, eyeshadow (I think!), and lipstick. Also perfume. I can’t picture Mum using mascara, but maybe she did as a younger woman. Getting ready to go out for the evening, or to host a dinner party, would see my stepfather showered, shaved, after shave applied, hair slicked back (with what I’ve no idea). Mum would apply eyeshadow on these occasions, as well as the rest of her usual make up. She’d use perfume and wear jewellery, and a carefully chosen outfit. I don’t remember Mum having to do much with her hair on a day-to-day basis. She had good hair, right to the end of her life, and had a cut and colour every few weeks, letting it go grey only in the last few years. I give very little time to getting ready to go out, either for work or socialising, though I do like my clothes and take some care over what I buy and how I look. I love nice shoes/boots and bags too. I have never worn much make-up; have never been someone who wouldn’t leave the house without make-up on, and I feel I’m not very skilled at applying it. Some of my friends feel the same, and we have remarked on how different it is for our children, who have become much more skilled that we’ve ever been, thanks to instruction from YouTube and other social media. I have a low-maintenance haircut, so not much to do there other than wash it every couple of days and then blow dry it or just let it dry, depending on time and inclination. Since the first lockdown, almost a year ago, I haven’t bothered with make­up! I will again once I go back to the office. My routine was to use a light foundation, mascara and lipstick. Sometimes I wore eye shadow and sometimes not. I like necklaces and have worn those even in lockdown, depending on my outfit. I find I have stopped wearing earrings, strangely, and this is a mistake, as they are now irritating my ears!"

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health I am really fortunate to enjoy very good health and have far fewer problems than my husband and daughters. Early on during lockdown, I had a very mild cold but lost my sense of taste. For many weeks, it only partially returned. Very recently, loss of smell or taste has been added to the list of Covid19 symptoms on which people are supposed to act by self-isolating. At around the same time, E (21 year old daughter) was briefly unwell and had cough. She was self-isolating in her room anyway, having returned home from her student house, and decided she wanted to self-isolate in her room, though that wasn’t strictly necessary. (After the first couple of weeks, she moved in with her boyfriend and his family, as she was too anxious at the prospect of her sister returning to work at the hospital.) Have we both had Covid? We can’t know. I’ve been reporting symptoms, or lack of them, most days (it’s supposed to be daily but I sometimes forget) through the Covid19 symptom tracker app, to provide data on Covid. O (19 year old daughter) had just been referred by her for a first cardiac outpatients appointment when we entered lockdown, but that is on hold. She’d been experiencing some odd heart rhythms. Hopefully there is nothing seriously wrong… She and my husband T have some long-term mental health problems and both have had a telephone consultation with their GP during lockdown, which has worked fine. What doesn’t work well is filling in an online form for the GP practice, to indicate that you need to consult a GP and giving reasons why. O did this on two occasions, not emergencies, and both times it told her she needed to go to A&E or call 999 immediately! So she gave up on that and phoned the GP practice instead. Both O and T have experienced swings in their moods and T is currently anxious and low. O usually has quite big variations in her moods and on the whole I think she’s been coping surprisingly well, given the uncertainties and the suspension of all her activities. She has been at college part time this year and working on a maternity unit part time – but the local college made no contact once we went into lockdown, and she is currently not allowed to do her job, as she is considered at too high risk from Covid19 given her asthma. She did have a big low the other week, feeling that she couldn’t bear lockdown any longer. She was very keen to go to join friends in Swansea, including the young man with whom she was enjoying a new romance during lockdown through long chats on FaceTime. This hugely increased our stress, anticipating all the problems with that, both actual (illegal for starters) and potential (she could get ill there, might jeopardise her job and future career, we and her sister would all feel anxious, and so on). We had a difficult conversation with her and there was a falling out between her and T. We were relieved when she dropped the idea but it’s still in the back of my mind that she could dip that low again and do something rash. Having said that, I normally have good mental health and am emotionally pretty level, but there have been other times recently when I have felt low and anxious, as a result of the current situation. It has also been hard, much of the time, to find the motivation to go out for walks (even though it’s my favourite time of year, we have lovely places to walk and the weather has been wonderful!) or to do things that, in theory, I want to do. Lots of other people have said the same. I read this on Twitter recently (I’m afraid I can’t give a source, it came from someone who said their wife told them this) and it resonated with me: 'Crises have 3 psychological phases: 1. Emergency: Shared clear goals and urgency makes us feel energised, focused and even productive. 2. Regression (and most of us are here right now): We realise the future is uncertain, lose sense of purpose, get tired, irritable, withdrawn and less productive. 3. Recovery: we begin to reorient, revise our goals, expectations, roles and begin to focus on moving beyond vs getting by.” I certainly feel I’m in stage 2, though I feel better than I did a week ago. We’ve also been bereaved during this period. My lovely mum, whom we all loved so very much, died on 12th April, Easter Sunday (good timing Mum, the most important day in the church calendar!). She had been declining with dementia, but we were surprised that this was clearly accelerating in the early part of this year and we found ourselves facing the likelihood that she would soon have to go into residential care. In fact, on our last trip before lockdown, a couple of days before, T and I were returning to Oxford from London, and on the coach I opened an email from my sister with the title “It’s time”, with the latest news of Mum and meaning it was time to look for residential care. My heart sank at that. Mum was being beautifully cared for by her wonderful live-in carer, S, supported by two kind visiting carers, one of whom Mum had known and loved for years (she used to be her cleaner). Her wish was always to die peacefully at home and this is what happened. She wasn’t even acutely ill; her death certificate gives dementia as the cause of death. It became apparent that Mum was likely to die soon and S kept in close contact with us via WhatsApp. Of course, we couldn’t go and see her, not even my sister A, who lived nearby, because of the conditions of lockdown. Although this was hard, we were conscious too that there would have been hard things about seeing her, and especially for our daughters. We were relieved that she wasn’t missing us, and we are so very grateful that she was cared for so tenderly to the last and died so peacefully at home, as she wished. Although we’re really sad, we’re so grateful for all she has been spared, both the horrors of decline and from the difficulties of lockdown restrictions – especially if she had had to go into a home, from which we’d be barred from entering. That would have been incredibly stressful and distressing for us and quite possibly for Mum. Mum was cremated with no-one in attendance. My two sisters and I quickly agreed on that. We couldn’t have imagined this just a few weeks before. Unthinkable! Mum’s wishes were few – a Christian ceremony and some people to say some nice things about her. We haven’t managed that, but we will, eventually. I think the alternative would have been for just my local sister and her husband to attend. Mum’s siblings wouldn’t have been allowed, given their ages, and we and my other sister are too far away to have gone for the day – and not allowed to use public transport. This seemed a worse prospect, so we opted for ‘direct cremation’. I also had in mind the very recent experience of friends of ours, who had to attend a relative’s funeral via video link, with just a few people present at the funeral. They had found this quite distressing, especially being able to see family members there, upset, and not be able to do anything to comfort them. It was a comfort to me that on the day of Mum’s cremation I knew some of my friends and family were praying and a group from my church gathered on Zoom to pray for her and us, which I was really touched by. Early in the 6thmorning (we didn’t know what time the cremation would take place, only the day – May), E and I spent time together on FaceTime, talking about Mum, and we each read out something we’d written – E a poem and me a letter written as if to Mum. We lit candles and blew them out at the end. Later in the morning, T, O and I did something similar here. These things were comforting. My eldest sister, D, who lives on the west coast of Ireland, sent us some photos and a video of what they’d done that day. Her partner A made a cardboard boat and they made an ‘offering of flowers’. A put in a marigold for Ganesh, who is said to smooth one's journey, and a sandalwood incense cone. D put in pink flowers plus five sprigs of forget-me-not: three to represent Mum's daughters and two to represent her siblings. D waded out into the water and set the boat on its way. It headed off into the West and they watched it for a good while. D also put words on the beach -WITH GRATITUDE, M [name], MOTHER – SISTER, PEACE, LOVE AND LIGHT, ALWAYS, while A drew a huge mandala in the sand. Our sister A said she hadn’t come up with anything to do and that seemed a shame for her; she’s in lockdown with her husband and I think he wouldn’t have thought of doing anything ceremonial. I have found it comforting to think of creative ways we could commemorate and celebrate Mum’s life, and of what we might do when we can finally have a gathering. I am beginning to wonder if this will even happen this year though. It will be good when we can go to her flat. Although sad, I think this is part of the grieving process. T, E and O have all said they would like to do this. This too has to wait. I think it will be fascinating to learn, in the years ahead, about the political, social and economic changes of this time, precipitated or shaped by the pandemic. Some will be transient and others will endure in one form or another, I imagine. Death in the time of Covid is different; we’re creating new rituals, for one thing. I feel we have been fortunate in our experience of Mum’s death, both for her and for ourselves. I’ve read of terrible experiences of people dying alone, or in hospitals and care homes with no loved one with them, relatives saying their goodbyes via phones, ipads and so on. Many people will be terribly traumatised not only by the death of loved ones but by the manner of it, the circumstances around it, and the loss of rituals and ceremonies that were important to them. Just one facet of the many difficult things Covid and the restrictions imposed have brought with them. The Government It’s hard to know where to begin when it comes to talking about the political decisions that have been made! I didn’t vote for this government, am strongly opposed to Brexit and had no respect for Johnson (the Prime Minister) before all this, but I feel they really have plumbed depths I wouldn’t have imagined. Their handling of it has been utterly shambolic. Other nations, if they’re looking at us at all, must be incredulous. How can they be getting it so wrong? At the time of writing, we have possibly the highest rate of excess deaths from Covid in the world. How can that be?! Their handling of the pandemic so far has been characterised by delay, deceit, and putting political considerations before scientific ones, posturing and politicking before public health. Their communications have been appalling. Their change of message from “Stay home” to “Stay alert, control the virus, save lives” in May, with a few lockdown measures eased, was met with derision. How exactly are we to stay alert? And control the virus? It instantly gave rise to memes, of course (some have been collected here https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/stay-alert-memes-boris-johnson­lockdown-update-a4436921.html) . At least people’s sense of humour is alive and well, and funny responses to political blunders over the weeks have given us a little light relief. In recent times, they have blatantly gone against scientific advice. They’re not even bothering to conceal lies, or explain them. Many people feel they were slow to put us into lockdown and our now easing restrictions too soon, when “the science” doesn’t support it, although of course “the science” actually covers a variety of best guesses (1m, 1.5 or 2m for social distancing, for instance?). Johnson has silenced the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance, flanking him at some of the press conferences, when it hasn’t suited him to let them answer. Apparently Chris Whitty refused to reduce the alert level from 4 to 3 last weekend, but the government went ahead on ‘Happy Monday’ by easing some of the restrictions, moves that had been listed as appropriate for when we reach level 1, the lowest risk category. Johnson appears to be more incoherent than ever, when he appears at all. He was hospitalised with Covid early on; no wonder, as the government were mixing and mingling when they should have known better. Now the odious Jacob Rees-Mogg (MP), who appears like a visiting ghost from the Victorian aristocracy, has succeeded in enforcing a return to Westminster for MPs to vote, despite the utter folly of that in terms of infection risk (and the long distance travel that many will have to undertake to get there and home again) and on the first day one of the MPs was showing signs of illness. Sports such as horse racing have started again this week. What nonsense! An economic decision of course. I was surprised they were so slow to stop big gatherings for sports. O and I were in Liverpool on 10th and 11th March, a week before lockdown, as she had a university interview. As we left, vast crowds were due to arrive for an international football match. We were well aware that Covid was a growing concern in the UK by then and astonished that it was going ahead. Public confidence in the government fell even further with the fiasco of the Cummings affair a couple of weeks ago. Dominic Cummings is Johnson’s key advisor, long portrayed in the media as a powerful psychopath behind the PM. It emerged that during lockdown, in April, he’d made a trip to Durham with his wife and child, going to his parents’ house for help with childcare, as they were both ill with Covid/suspected covid and, while there, a 60 mile round daytrip to Barnard Castle (apparently to test his eyesight, which gave rise to both incredulity and derision!). There were many flagrant floutings of the rules he had helped create, regarding travel during lockdown and clearly he should have resigned, or been sacked, as others have had to do for breaches (CMO for Scotland among them). The thing rumbled on and there was then a ludicrous press conference, where DC explained himself and took questions. Lies were piled upon lies and confusion upon rules that were supposedly clear. Once again, people managed to find humour in it and had a field day on social media. He gave us all plenty of material. However, people have been left very angry. No apology, no resignation or sacking. The line taken was “he did what any concerned parent would do”, but millions of us as concerned parents, or concerned people with sick relatives, have followed the rules and stayed away. This line of argument makes us look like fools. People are furious that it’s “one rule for ‘them’ and one rule for ‘us’”. Extraordinary that Johnson has compromised so much, including the public health message, to save his advisor. I was moved to write to Robert Courts, our (Tory) MP, calling for him to condemn Cumming’s actions, but he spoke out in support of him. I had a cut-and-paste response with no effort to personalise it, not mentioning Mum’s death, which I had cited in my short email to him. Many, many MPs received emails about this and some Tory MPs did speak out against Cummings. He has survived thus far, but lockdown was immediately compromised and there was a noticeable shift in people’s willingness to comply. It’s surely related to this that the government moved swiftly to ease some of the lockdown restrictions when scientific advisors didn’t support it. It is thought we are in for a second wave of infection and there is such a lack of confidence in the government’s handling of it all. Our infection rates are still awful. Primary schools were supposed to be admitting years 1 and 6 in ‘bubbles’, with other social distancing measures’, but many have simply not done this and now there is a U-turn on this, with schools not expecting to be fully functioning (if then) until the new academic year in September. There has been a rumbling debate about whether mask-wearing by the general public should be recommended or mandatory, and under what circumstances. Now the World Health Organisation (WHO) has changed it stance in favour of masks, saying recent evidence is in the direction of supporting mask wearing. It is to be compulsory on public transport from 15th June and the WHO recommends wearing them in other places indoors where social distancing is difficult. As someone who relies on lipreading, this is going to complicate life for me (and many others). I think the government will take steps in the weeks and months ahead to open things up and establish a ‘new normal’, driven primarily by economic and political interests rather than scientific ones. There is talk of local lockdowns in response to infection rates and so they may do that. It’s hard to anticipate what this ‘new normal’ might be. Many things that I would like to resume feel like they may be a long way off. I try not to look ahead too much, but focus on the day in hand. I’m not terribly good at that, but I try. News I check the BBC and The Guardian online in the morning and later in the day, including to see if there was anything significant said at the 5pm broadcast – but not every day. I have watched very few of the live broadcasts, not easy for me anyway as I largely rely on captions/subtitles. I did watch it when the Cummings thing broke though, glued to it! I was tweeting in response to it too, during the broadcast. It was interesting that over that weekend, at the height of attention on the Cummings fiasco, I was a fairly avid consumer of that news, fascinated to see how it would play out, but T said consuming news was contributing to his anxiety so I said I wouldn’t talk to him about it. Failing to provide a BLS interpreter was yet another thing the government got wrong and have been very slow to introduce. Quite right that Nicola Sturgeon’s broadcasts have been signed. They so often seem to do things better in Scotland than here! I see Twitter every day so I see some news and responses to it there, and click through if there’s an article that sounds interesting. Work and home life T and I have both been working from home during lockdown. I feel grateful that we are not among those who have lost jobs or income during this time, and the change is less for us than some, as we are both used to working at home some of the time. I generally worked at home two days a week and spent three in the office. Early on in lockdown, the caretaker of our building, who happens to live near me, kindly delivered my office chair, and I moved O’s unwanted desk into ‘my’ room – a room I use for crafts and storing things and that can be turned into a guest bedroom when needed. So this is now my office, although I sometimes bring my laptop downstairs and work at the dining room table or in the sitting room, on the sofa. I can do my job perfectly well from home, and I’m aware that cutting out the travelling gives me more time to do other things. But I miss seeing my lovely colleagues, whom I think of as my ‘work family’. I miss the chat over the kettle, or sitting together at lunchtime. I miss talking with A, who sits next to me and who has been my friend for about 25 years! I miss popping to the shops at lunchtime and A and I were eagerly anticipating the arrival of a new bookshop near work this spring. I miss the laughs with S, whose job is most closely aligned with mine. However, S and I are able to work well together via Zoom, which gives us the chance to chat a bit and have some laughs. Slack is also good – it’s a messaging platform that we’re all on, which enables us to have a bit of chat and banter, as well as exchange information relating to work. We’ve had a couple of Friday evening Zoom socials too – cocktail-making demonstrations! Other meetings are also being held via Zoom. It’s very good that we can do this, but it’s not as good as being together. I miss choosing clothes to wear to work and admiring other people’s; chatting with T (colleague) about clothes we’ve seen online, or perhaps bought. I miss the variety of being in different places. During lockdown, I have missed two planned work trips to Ireland, and I’m sad that I’ve missed out on those, both for the pleasure of being with colleagues and the work we’d have done but also because T and I were going to add on a bit of holiday to both trips and I would have gone to stay with my sister as part of of one of them. Some of the time it’s been quite hard to be motivated to get on with work and I’ve been less productive than normal. Colleagues have said the same thing. I’m not sure why this is so, but it seems a common experience. There’s something about not having the stimulus of being among colleagues; all the incidental bits of information shared and ideas discussed when we’re together. I’ve worked best when I’ve been doing that on zoom with S and we’re making good progress on a project. It’s hard to imagine when it will be possible to be in the office again, though how and when this might be possible is starting to be talked about. We can do everything from home, and I’m reliant on public transport so it might take longer for me to get back than others. Colleagues with children of school age and younger have definitely been feeling the strain. I’m grateful we’re not at that stage and having to grapple with home schooling, though there were times when home schooling would have been a blessed relief for our girls compared with going to school! I am very aware of our good fortune in having a big comfortable house with plenty of space, where we can be together or have time alone. We have a garden too. It’s been fine being together, on the whole, though moods have been up and down and this can affect the others in the house of course. We’re aware that this is a terrible time for so many, who live in poor conditions, who have abusive relationships and so on. We are very fortunate, with nothing worse to deal with than a bit of irritation, or the usual stresses that are (in my experience) part of being a parent! T was driving me a bit mad the other day, in a mood to talk at great length, as he does, until in the end I had to say that I couldn’t listen any more to details of drill bits and shall we go and watch television?! Lockdown has been hard on O and I worry about it. She’s had just about every aspect of her life disrupted, including the college course she should have been completing (not been possible as they have made no contact since the beginning of lockdown) and her job at the hospital, which she’s not allowed to do at the moment because of concern about her risk from covid as someone with asthma. She is hoping to be able to take up a university place but it remains to be seen if they will admit her without the college course being completed and to the required standard. We really hope so… She misses her friends terribly, although of course they keep in touch via FaceTime etc, and she misses her usual social life. E has fared better, lockdown having relieved her of the pressure to go out and socialise, which she often doesn’t want to do. She has enjoyed talking to friends over FaceTime or by other means, and of course has spent most of lockdown with her boyfriend and his family. I’m very relieved that she has managed to complete her university work (this is her final year), but her future plans are also in disarray and she expects to have to return home for a while and take stock. She had planned to get a job and get a flat with her boyfriend in their university town for his final year there. Technology Work has been conducted in the usual ways through email and Slack, the latter allowing us some scope for chatting too, with the only change in our use of technology there being to use Zoom (a video conferencing platform) regularly for meeting and collaborating, which I have done very occasionally in the past for the odd meeting. We have also used it for two social meetings with colleagues, as mentioned before. I have newly used Zoom for social meetings with friends. Three of us have been meeting as a book group for about 15 years or so (there used to be more of us) and we have now met twice on Zoom, which has been lovely, if not as good as meeting in person. I’ve also joined in a Zoom chat with some of my nursing cohort, and E and I have used it for her to share sections of her work (sharing her s screen so I could see it) and ask for my comments As at all other times, my friendships have been really important to me at this time and also my family, especially my sisters. My sisters and I have exchanged emails, as usual, but as recent adopters of smartphones (they are dinosaurs!) we have been able to exchange messages and photos by WhatsApp and have been using this more than email. I’ve also been enjoying exchanging emails with my uncle, which we did sometimes before lockdown, currently sharing information relating to our family history. At the very beginning of lockdown, my friend G, who lives five minutes walk from me, emailed and suggested we exchange emails every day, saying:“What I am thinking is to share with you some of my concerns, but also every day to write three positive things about my day and share those with you. Would you like to do the same? That way we can share some positives with each other and hope it helps to keep us on a more even keel.” We have been doing this ever since, over eighty days now, and it has helped us both very much. I really look forward to emailing G and receiving her emails. We have met in person once, sitting in her garden 2m apart for a while one evening, and that was so good. I am not keen on Facebook, but I am using it in lockdown mostly to access live Jazzercise (exercise) sessions, which our local instructors are providing. I’m using FaceTime to talk to one friend and to E. Chatting to people via screens is a bit of a mixed experience for me. When it works well, I like it, but as I rely on lipreading to supplement my hearing it doesn’t work if the picture freezes or becomes even fractionally out of sync with the sound. However, I am a sociable creature and appreciate all forms of contact. I have a couple of friends with whom I use Snapchat, so that has carried on as before. I also use Instagram and Twitter and my use of those hasn’t changed, as social platforms but Twitter also as a place for conversation and to find articles of interest relating to my work and (to a lesser extent) my leisure interests. I do send occasional letters and also cards (for birthdays and at other times) in the post but have felt unsure whether some people might be worried about the potential for contamination by covid on the mail. I’ve sent birthday cards though, and I have also really enjoyed sending gifts to a few friends, not prompted by birthdays but just for wanting to give them a little treat and let them know I’ve been thinking about them. I’m sure this has given me just as much pleasure as it has given them. I spotted a book online, for instance, that I thought a friend would like, so sent it to her. I’ve also sent flowers, and have been delighted to receive flowers from several people, some prompted by Mum’s death or my birthday, but I also had flowers randomly from a school friend with whom I normally exchange birthday and Christmas cards, but we have not exchanged any gifts since school nor met since our twenties! I must remember this after lockdown and send more gifts not linked to birthdays or Christmas; I am fortunate to have the disposable income to enable me to do it. Shopping and food Before lockdown, we had a delivery of organic fruit and vegetables perhaps three weeks in four and about two deliveries of groceries bought online each month. We’d supplement these with lots of small purchases at the Co-op, a minute’s walk from the house. I often said I’d have to be much more organised and plan better if I lived some distance from the shops (as one of my sisters does – she has to drive four miles for the nearest shop of any kind!). We would also sometimes go to a bigger supermarket in the middle of Witney, perhaps because we hadn’t planned what we would have or got round to ordering online. Online shopping has been something we’ve done, if only for some of our shopping, for a long time, so I was amazed to learn that before lockdown online grocery shopping was an incredibly small proportion of all grocery shopping -something like 7%. However, we haven’t got a car, and even when we did we didn’t use it more than very rarely to do food shopping, so I suppose we are unusual. At the beginning of lockdown, or when it was coming, there was panic-buying of many things, and it was utterly bizarre to go into Waitrose and see the fruit and vegetable areas largely empty. There was a highly advertised rush on loo roll and flour, oh and hand sanitizer could not be bought from very early on, though it seems to have made a reappearance now. Retailers were cashing in too. M&S, I saw in the news, was selling a bottle of hand sanitizer for £11! It’s normally cheap stuff. I discovered early on that we are well stocked, despite my self-image as someone who is disorganised about shopping. I suppose I’m aware of the contrast with my rural sisters; if there’s an urgent need for a toothbrush, they must have spares in their cupboards, where I’ve always been able to just nip out and buy one, from very early in the morning to very late at night. So we have not had a shortage of food or other essentials, though it felt possible that we might and, like others, whilst not panic-buying or getting large quantities of anything, I think we overbought in March. I certainly spent a lot more! At the start of lockdown, it wasn’t possible to get delivery slots with Ocado (our usual online shop) or with Riverford (veg box), but these quite quickly opened up. Riverford has reduced their selection to cope with current challenges and we have set up a weekly order, and we now have some scope to change our selection if we want to. We’ve also been placing weekly orders with Ocado. New for us in lockdown, we have been getting fortnightly deliveries of local eggs, to which local strawberries have now been added. We are really appreciating all this and intend to keep it going beyond lockdown. We have only needed very occasional forays to the Co-op and have been only once to Waitrose I think. Mostly I have walked past the long queues for Waitrose and been thankful I didn’t have to shop these. T says he has noticed the silence around these queues – people not talking to each other, whether masked or not. I wondered if this would be different in other places, reflecting a rather unsociable local culture, but T thinks it is fear of breathing coronavirus on each other. Just before lockdown, we were pleased by the arrival in Witney of a small shop. Wast0 (which we refer to as Waste-O, to the amused annoyance of E, though we know full well it’s zero not O!) where you can buy products loose, taking your own packaging, and it is good that this has remained open and we have been able to use it. Aside from the benefits of no packaging, it has been a source of flour, which has been largely unobtainable online. They have restricted the number of people in it at one time and, since the WHO guidance on masks changed, I wore a cloth mask when I went in last time (bought there actually, on a previous visit. I paid £5 and by this visit the price had been put up to £6.50!). I was surprised at how unpleasant it was to wear it and was glad to take it off when I got outside. Our eating and cooking habits haven’t significantly changed, although I think I’m"

Mass-Observer K7066 describes themself as female; age 49; in a relationship; librarian.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, Wellbeing and the Healthy Body ‘Health’ means to me a sense of peace and ease, where body and mind are united and neither feels stress or strain or pain. It means nutritious food, sufficient rest, emotional connection and safety (emotional and physical, such as safe housing). ‘Wellbeing’ is something I find harder to define. I mainly hear the word at work and I dislike it; the way corporations use it to mean yoga in your lunchbreak, free apples and training courses on personal resilience while at the same time reducing staff numbers, increasing workloads and restricting pay. Wellbeing, if I think of that word at all in a personal way, can be generated perhaps by a sense of security and love. ‘A healthy body’ is one which is nourished and rested and is physically safe, and has the strength to deal with life’s troubles and joys.  The first five words I think of are: holistic, nourishment, sleep, care, warmth. My youngest niece comes to mind – aged 10, full of energy, comfy with her sense of self and place in her family, dancing and drawing and laughing and dealing equably with both rows and fun with her friends in the playground. And able to do endless cartwheels. Identity When I think of my health, I think mainly of my Mum and maternal Granny, who both cook(ed) what they called “homey” food, modest homemade cooking, which they use(d) to show their love via the sharing and eating of meals. These meals they gave me I believe kept me healthy in a general way and influenced my own attitude to food and cooking and a desire to eat nutritiously. This cooking was handed down through generations of Scottish working women, and I feel part of that long chain – even though I don’t work on the land or in service as my ancestors did (very far from it!). I am thankful for this tradition of cooking and eating simply and feel it is the basis of my physical health. My ill health has in part been salvaged by this food, too. When I was 17, I almost died of Sepsis, but my recovery amazed even the hospital doctors with its speed. I stayed with my Granny and she fed me well, healing my blood in the process. My father died young of a brain tumour, and many of his siblings also had cancer. I have often thought that their childhood growing up poor in north Lebanon, near to a gas works, affected them all so I know that social conditions directly affect health in very negative ways. My own mental ill health (I have had problems with depression and anxiety since I was ten) I often feel has been exacerbated by my social conditions, by not having the space (physically, financially or metaphorically) to ever stop and reflect and try and heal. Life is relentless, and often played out in cramped conditions, but I know also that I am very much luckier than many. I have had some Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian serious illnesses in my life but also lots of support, from the NHS and from my family, not least my Mum and Granny and their belief in the power of Scottish cooking. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Wellbeing is a word I have only really heard about in recent years. It is not one I particularly respond to. Health, however, is something I can relate to in different ways. I don’t know when I first started to think about it but my Mum has always believed that mind and body are linked, and she taught me that from a young age. I tend to agree with her, certainly in part – my depression leads to my back aching, as an example. She tried to instil in me and my brother a sense of balance. Although I have failed in that, and am not balanced, I agree that there is good sense in aiming for it. Mum had responsibility for my health when I was young, as a lone parent. Mum worked hard, at more than one job, to ensure my brother and I were provided for. I decided to go vegetarian when I was 12 or 13. My Mum responded with her usual practical positivity, her one concern being my health. She went to the local library and borrowed the one book they had about vegetarianism. After she read it, she agreed that I could become vegetarian, and then created some recipes using vegetables, lentils and nuts. I admired her for that, for not questioning me but just dealing with it practically. Beyond the above I don’t remember talking about health at home, but I learnt much of my attitude from Mum and Granny, which is quite stoical – if you are ill you just get on with things, and try not to make a fuss! Illness is part of life, physical and mental. Severe mental illness runs in my Mum’s side of my family, and my Mum and Granny always tried to carry on in practical ways when people around them were mentally ill. My Grandad was similar in attitude; he had severe depression and breakdowns and had one arm amputated when he was only 14, but he never said he was disabled. He tried to do everything he could independently. I suppose I have some of that same stoic attitude to illness, although I am not sure that it is always helpful, especially not with regards to mental illness where I am more open than many in my family (and have attended depression support groups, for instance). At school, we studied what was called Home Economics for a couple of years. We learnt about nutrition and did some cooking, although as I was vegetarian at a time when it was not common to be so, I couldn’t take part in much of the meat-focussed food preparation. We had some information given to us about sexual health and periods; I have a memory of a female police officer from the Met coming to the school and talking about contraception. I am not sure why she was asked to do it. I was young during the first cases of the HIV virus and the Aids crisis – we received some education about this at school which frightened us all, and I remember the government adverts voiced by John Hurt which were terrifying. Rape alarms were also handed out in the wake of the Suzy Lamplugh disappearance, and I kept mine with me everywhere I went for quite a long time. The world definitely felt scary, predatory and not a safe place. Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian I learnt most of value about sexual health from talking with friends, sharing our experiences, and also from magazines. Even the NME, which was a music paper, had in the 1980s and 1990s articles on drugs and addiction and sex, and I read these avidly. A lot of the music I listened to was basically about drugs and sex and so I learnt a lot from these, too; much more than I ever did from school or my family. Key Moments I remember puberty as being intensely awkward. I grew extremely tall – five inches in one year – and thin and felt self-conscious for many years after that. I suppose the main part of puberty I remember, and which is one of the key bodily changes associated with it, was my first period. I had just turned 12 but remember the day clearly, even now. I was prepared for its arrival – Mum had told me all about it, and I had a bag ready with some sanitary pads in it. When it happened, however, I remember feeling both relieved that it had finally started but also physically faint. I took the bus to school as normal but had to get off at each stop as I felt my legs wouldn’t hold me up. A friend got off the bus with me and asked me if my periods had begun as she had felt the same when hers started. All day I had to put my hand up in class and ask to go to the toilet to check all was well. It is strange, though, how quickly it all became normal and I no longer felt faint or like I needed to check. I was glad it happened initially, although at many points during my life wished I could just turn off my periods and be done with them. Growing Older Throughout my life I have tried to stay physically healthy mainly through eating vegetables and pulses, and through walking. I am quite a physically lazy person in some ways and have no interest at all in sport of any kind, but I love walking. Before COVID-19 I walked miles every day and even now I am more restricted I make sure I do a long-ish walk each day. More than anything walking helps me with my anxiety and mental health but it is also a way for me to feel connected to my environment. Before COVID I also went to clog dance classes, and sometimes performed with a group of clog dancers. I miss not being able to clog dance during these months of social distancing and lockdowns. Movement helps me manage my anxiety. Equally, however, I find sleeping helps my anxiety. I often nap during the day. My main health battles are with my mental health – over the last 39 years I have tried all kinds of therapy, have taken medication for years, and experimented with a range of treatments and ideas – but I still get laid low by depression and anxiety on a regular basis. I have a very bad back and have had stomach ulcers and related problems and feel that these are linked with my mental health, at least in some part. Despite this, I feel more at one with my body than I did when I was younger. My back may hurt more than it did but my body feels less awkward as a whole; I feel less ashamed of it. I am edging towards menopause now and looking forward to finally getting shot of my periods which have been both troublesome and painful for 37 years. I won’t miss them. I still get health information from my friends (we have started to share Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian middle-aged health tips, such as how to stretch aching muscles) but also now of course via the Internet, although I try to stick to sites such as the NHS site as I know from experience how risky it can be to self-diagnose from websites. I can feel myself slowing down a bit now, and I suppose that my energy levels will continue to decrease. I don’t mind that really as I hope that my anxiety levels will correspondingly decline, too. Health, Wellbeing and Appearance There are links between health and external appearance. Not just the obvious ones such as if you are healthy your eyes will be brighter, but emotionally there are links. I was an awkward teenager and young adult, and was ridiculed a great deal in the street for how I looked. This led to me withdrawing from social life for a long time, and influenced how I felt about myself and my body for many years – it was only really in my late 30s onwards that I started to deal with some of these feelings. I therefore have been heavily influenced, negatively, by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance and my feelings that I was very far from these. The question about identity was asked earlier in this directive, and it is here that I think my mixed cultural heritage plays a part in my health (or otherwise). I realise now that most of what was ridiculed about me was from my Asian side: my looks (big, wild hair, for example), my attitudes, and even the food I ate. I see now that I was ridiculed as these aspects of my background seemed strange to other children, but I did not see that link at the time. I now refuse to hide or tame these aspects and feel healthier as a result. My Mum is not much concerned with popular ideas of physical appearance. She is not concerned with what people think of her in many ways at all. She is a rare, tough, outgoing person who demands to be accepted as she is or it is your loss. She has her own sense of style, though. From what I have been told, my Dad was the opposite – he was fashion-conscious and liked to dress well and look good. I have seen pictures of him on nights out in sharp suits with his hair slicked. He had the typical working-class attitude of dressing up when possible and looking smart. I am a bit like both of my parents – I enjoy clothes and dressing up but have a particular style which is sometimes in fashion, but mostly is not. There are some beauty products that I swear by. For many years I used a Boots No. 7 lipstick from their Stay Perfect range in a shade called Grace – it was dark red and I loved it. Unfortunately, about four years ago Boots ceased producing it. I wrote to them asking for its return, but to no avail. I have one stubby stick left, used only for special occasions. Despite looking for and buying many other dark red lipsticks, I have yet to find one that I like as much as I did Grace. The one product I could not live without, however, is Anne French Deep Cleansing Milk. I began using it in my early 20s as it is not tested on animals, comes in an attractive tear shaped bottle, and feels wonderful on my skin; it still does and I buy Female, 49, In a Relationship, London, Librarian multiple bottles at a time as I dread running out. This would be my Desert Island product, without a doubt. Getting Ready to Leave the House My Mum always worked in jobs which required her getting dirty to some extent (child care, adult care, chip shop counter worker) so she never got dressed up to go to work, rather would have to wear basic stuff. She had a tabard or uniform in some of her jobs. My Dad was a waiter so had to look smart at work but I cannot remember him going to work, only returning home in the dark from late shifts. My Mum has never enjoyed dressing up so even when she is going out, she doesn’t really have any rituals. She will put non-work clothes on and a bit of lippy or perfume, but that is it. She has no sense of smell so sometimes has been known to overdo the perfume; I remember that well and my brother good-humouredly teasing her about it. My routine is also quite simple. I always put-on lipstick and earrings for work or going out socialising. If I have my lipstick on and a pair of earrings, I feel OK. Going to work in the mornings (pre-COVID) was difficult – I did everything by rote, with little thought, as it takes me a long time to fully wake up. Going out in the evenings I would put music on, dance and sing a bit while I got ready, and probably try on and disregard multiple outfits before settling for one I felt comfy in. The biggest change over time is that I feel less angst about all this – I no longer worry so much what I look like. Earrings and lipstick are the main things; although it seems a long time since I went out anywhere, I still put on both these things, sitting at home."

Fortunately, neither I nor the person I live with have been unwell with COVID-19. I live with someone who has COPD and is therefore at a higher risk if he were to contact COVID-19. Keeping him safe has been the prime focus of the last three months so we have both been inside for most of the day during lockdown to limit chances of either of us catching the coronavirus.

For me, however, I have had to get used to a much more physically restricted lifestyle. Before the lockdown I walked a great deal, went to dance lessons, and was a generally active person. We live in a small flat with only a bedroom and one other room, so staying in has been tough both physically (my back aches badly) and psychologically. There is not even really any space to walk around inside the flat. Working from home has been tricky as I don’t have space for a desk or chair to work at. I know I am fortunate, however, to have a job that enables me to still work at home. My mental health would be much worse if I lost my job, that is certain. I have clinical depression and have had for many years, so I am quite used to dealing with it and have managed to keep my health relatively under control during lockdown. I think the enforced slowing down and reduction of social contact has actually had a positive effect on my mental health. It feels like a relief to not have to deal with as many people as usual. I feel quite bad writing that as the circumstances leading to that feeling are so terrible, but I have found that side of lockdown beneficial. My emotions have been all over the place though, as have my energy levels. Sometimes calm, sometimes anxious, other times very tired and weary. I assume this is not uncommon during this time of such uncertainty. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made?  What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months?  I can hardly write about the government’s handling of the pandemic without ranting. I feel despair at our government, at their slow response, their deceit, their willingness to allow care home staff and residents to suffer, and now their too-soon easing of lockdown. The furlough scheme is a good thing and has helped lots of people I know. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian Unfortunately, I think over the coming months the government will behave with the same carelessness and alter the remaining lockdown measures far too quickly. I fear for a second wave of the virus. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this?  At the start of the pandemic I was watching the 5pm broadcasts daily as I was keen to keep informed and felt I needed to know what the latest rules and rates of infection were. However, within about two weeks of lockdown, I found the whole experience so disheartening and at times infuriating (depending on which government minister was talking) that I decided to stop watching. I hardly watch any news now, as a means of actively avoiding the COVID talk, as the constant rolling news relies so much on speculation that it can become frustrating and anxiety-inducing in equal measure. Instead, I read the bullet point headlines in the papers the next day, and see if there is any new information or rules I need to understand – otherwise, I steer clear of it all. I fully support the inclusion of BSL for the briefings. I have hearing loss and use subtitles for all television. I am not a BSL user but for many deaf people this is their main language. It makes absolute sense to have an interpreter to ensure the deaf community receive correct information. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with?  How have you managed these challenges?  I am an academic librarian so work in a university library, which is located in a building shared by other university departments. The entire university closed a few days before the official lockdown began and I have been working from home ever since. I am extremely fortunate that I can do this as so many people are either still having to go to work as they are key workers, and are risking their health, or have lost their jobs entirely. I am extremely lucky to have a job that can be adapted to home working. Although I can by no means undertake all my work from home – I manage book collections, for instance, which are currently also in lockdown and that side of my job has had to cease – I can do a large percentage of it. For example, much of my job includes research and writing about the collections so I have done a great deal of this – writing blog posts, researching new collection areas, copyediting, Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian creating a book index – and other parts of my job which would normally happen in person are now being undertaken online, such as library inductions for new students. These latter I am planning via MS Teams and online training. I have been investigating the best ways in which to do that. I am also talking at online conferences. Working from home has always been possible with my job to a limited extent but before lockdown I hardly made use of it preferring to keep a distinction between my work and home. However, now I have been forced in to this position, I think I would like to maintain it to some extent once we return to regular patterns again. I would ideally like to work half the week in the library and half from home. When I say ‘work from home’ I would probably want to work from the public library, ideally, which is 5 minutes away from my flat. This is because the hardest part about working from home has been the tiny size of our flat which I share with one other person. We have no space for a desk or chair so I have bought a collapsible dining chair which I can fold-up each night, and each day I clear a bit of space on a table which is in the kitchen. This table has many objects covering it and each day I therefore move lots of stuff onto other kitchen surfaces to make my working space. This can be a tricky situation both for my back and neck and general comfort but also for the person I live with. He is always at home due to ongoing health problems and I sometimes feel I have invaded his daily routine with my presence, although he in no way complains. He has had to adapt to me being here – the size of our flat means he also has to endure the online library meetings that I go to, for instance, and where I sit blocks the toaster and the sink. I am also getting weary with the non-stop screen-based work, and writing so much. I miss the variety of my job which normally includes working with students in person and books, and moving around both mentally and physically much more than I can do now. I also miss not being out and about in London. Life has narrowed to two rooms. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? Oh goodness, yes, the endless technology of lockdown! I have been using new technology primarily for work as I work in higher education and we have all been thinking about how we can move our student-facing work online. As such, I have been testing Zoom and MS Teams and working out ways I can run my student sessions online next year. All the library meetings have been run via MS Teams. Thankfully, we all decided from the start that we didn’t want to use webcams so we Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian can’t see each other, only hear each other. I was very relieved about this, partly as I don’t want my home space broadcast to my colleagues (I still want to keep some barriers between home and work) and partly as I have taken to wearing very casual clothing while at home. I have hearing loss so find concentration is hard during online meetings but I can use closed captions on MS Teams, which are quite hilarious at times (they don’t always respond very accurately to our accents!). With my family I have had a couple of Zoom calls but these have been quite strange as my mum has a funny laptop and appears as a ghost – we can hardly see her – but it is good to see my little niece and nephews as I miss them greatly. At the start of lockdown, my closest friends and I – we are a group of 4 – started having Skype chats every weekend but, after about a month, these dwindled and stopped. We all found the forced routine of it tiring and we have now gone back to our normal way of communicating which is daily via our WhatsApp group. I find communicating via Zoom, Skype or Teams utterly exhausting and, now, quite stressful. When I am not required to talk, I turn off my mic and tend to try and zone in and out as necessary. Regarding social media – I am relatively active on Twitter but I have avoided reading or posting anything about COVID-19 and continue using it just as I did beforehand, which is to post about books, and art and London history and folklore as I normally do. I always avoid politics on Twitter (it is the only way to enjoy it, I think) and have made no changes to that area. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Living where I do, in Zone 2 of North London, I have been so fortunate to have access to food. The main issue has been social distancing which has been impossible in many local shops which are very small. As a result, for the first time in my life I have turned to online shopping to do a ‘big shop’ once a month. I have found Asda to be the easiest to use as their booking system is manageable, they have also been really reliable, and the people delivering have been great. For fresh food and items that I need in between Asda deliveries, I go out at 6am to a local shop which, amazingly, has retained its 24-hour opening regime. I only buy from Asda what I cannot get at this local shop. At 6am I am usually the only customer. It has very narrow aisles, as do all our local shops, so I don’t go any later as it very quickly is crowded and social distancing impossible. There is one other local shop I have used which I can go to during the afternoon in emergencies – this shop is also nearby and has been undertaking really good social distancing policies from the word go, only letting in three people at a time. It is a very small shop but they have been great at keeping everyone safe. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian At the start of lockdown, after all the panic buying, lots of things I would normally buy were unavailable especially vegetarian food: Quorn products disappeared entirely and are only now coming back into stock. Otherwise, nothing much has been a problem and my diet hasn’t changed in the main. I suppose the biggest difference for me is that as I am not at work I don’t eat the sort of lunches I used to, which were things bought from the work café, and I also went to local cafes every weekend for my breakfast – it was my weekly treat – and I really, really miss this. Nothing I cook at home replicates the pleasure I feel eating breakfast in a café. I love cafes, dearly, and cannot wait until they are open and it is safe to return to them. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have beeen watching, listening to and/or reading. In addition to work, I am in the middle of a research degree in English literature so I have spent a large part of lockdown reading novels, academic texts and archival material relating to my project. I do still have time – I ensure I do – for leisure reading and, to give myself a mental contrast, have plumped for lots of books that I enjoy and find page-turners rather than the academic works I have to slowly plough through. I enjoy supernatural and gothic stories, and have been reading some new-ish examples of these including Laura Purcell’s novels and also Bunny by Mona Awad. I find this a really enjoyable escape and can curl up and read for hours. My brother also gave us a Netflix login which we have made very good use of. We have watched repeats of old comedies such as Alan Partridge, dramas like Jonathan Creek, and films by Orson Welles. We have watched new series and really loved After Life, Unorthodox, and Shtisel. We have loads more lined up. We also love the Talking Pictures TV channel and watch films on there quite a bit. I have not taken up any new interests as I find it hard enough keeping up with what I normally do. I am a clog dancer and this, unfortunately, has had to cease for the time being as I live in a tiny flat surrounded by neighbours so I can never practice at home (clogs are loud!). I normally practiced at work. I miss this – the practice and the lessons – and really cannot wait to start dancing again. I also do cross stitch and have had a piece ongoing for ages, but have not made any particular progress during lockdown. For ten years I have been doing a photography project – I take one photo a day and upload it to Flickr. I have continued doing this over lockdown and have tried to take pictures which represent something of the nature of the lockdown on the streets around where I live. I have hundreds of these project photos from the last few years, which still need labelling. I thought during lockdown I might have done this but I have been too busy and / or sleepy. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian I have started one new little project, a small Instagram account where I put images and text daily about pamphlets, zines and booklets that I have in the flat. I love this kind of do-it-yourself publishing and am hoping to share this with others who do too. The radio is on a great deal in our flat. I enjoy listening to old comedies such as Round the Horne. I haven’t listened to much music, but occasionally have put some on in the background, mainly while I am doing housework. I don’t feel much like listening to music at the moment, though. Mainly, my escape has been a mix of Netflix and spooky novels. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My personal hygiene has become a sort of obsession with me during lockdown. I have been so scared of bringing the virus into the flat that I keep a set of ‘outdoor’ clothes in a carrier bag by the front door and have a shower every time I have been outside the flat, even if it is just to go downstairs to the bottom of the block to get the post (which does not entail going outside in to the streets). I have been washing my hands and using sanitiser gel after I touch pretty much anything that is not in my flat, and use disposable gloves, too. If I were living alone, I would not be so obsessive about it – would just stick to normal lockdown guidelines – but I am so scared of affecting the person I live with and his health that I am somewhat nervous about keeping the virus at bay. On the other hand, I have become much slobbier about my clothing and general appearance. As we don’t use the webcam for work meetings, and my friends don’t care what I look like, I have been wearing slouchy clothes indoors – pyjamas, mainly, to be honest. My hair is getting big – it grows out before it grows down – and I have not dyed my roots, leaving them for when I can go to the hairdresser again. I love lipstick and normally wear it all the time but I haven’t worn lipstick for three months now. I still use all my normal face and skin creams but that is about the only aspect I have maintained. Next week I have to talk at an online conference. I am going to put some temporary dye in my hair, put on a dress and lippy and try to spruce myself up a bit. I am quiet looking forward to that although it will feel a bit strange, too. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this?  Have Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Female, 48, In a Relationship, London, Librarian My sleep has been the opposite of insomnia, it has been excessive. I am on medication for depression and this has always had a soporific effect and whenever I get anxious, my body and mind start to shut down after a while and I curl up and sleep for hours. This has been happening a great deal during lockdown – I have often slept during the afternoon, and also still slept well at night. I am struggling to stay awake. I wonder if this is also partly due to the lack of air and being in the flat so much, and getting up early for social distanced walks (I go out at 6am). I have not been having nightmares but have had very vivid dreams, but this is not unusual and is, again I think, triggered somewhat by my medication. I have to admit that often sleeping is the one thing I most look forward to in a day. It is a safety valve. The person I live with also has not had any change in his sleeping patterns. His ill health also means he sleeps a great deal during the day. He tends to nod off on the settee around 3pm each day, whilst listening to the radio. He sleeps very well at night, too. We both love sleep."

A question that might be asked is: “How is your health?”, which is asking the respondent to rank or rate their health at a single point in time. An individual’s health at any given point will be determined by chronic conditions and ailments. Following a hip replacement, I’m a participant in a medical research project. I complete forms annually which are directly related to the artificial hip, pain, movement etc, but I’m also asked how I would rate my health on a scale of 1 to 100 on that particular day. This always seems very subjective as the figure could be significantly impacted by having a cold for instance(ailment) or an exacerbation of my generally controlled asthma(a condition). The request appears implicitly to require focus on physical(and thus measurable?) health to assess the efficacy (and future profit for the developers)of the artificial joint. “Wellbeing” “Wellbeing” is a term that stems more from alternative healthcare, and is an attempt to view an individual as a whole, with physical and mental health not regarded as discrete. A good physician will be interested in a patient’s wellbeing, although might find themselves focussing on health and more specifically a single ailment or concern because of limited resources.  Wellbeing also suggests that an individual has a degree of control over their physical and mental health as long as they are proactive in managing it, so responsibility for wellbeing is shifted to the individual (“Make sure you look after yourself”, “make time for yourself “). Conventional medicine will tend to use the phrase “quality of life” as a proxy for wellbeing. For instance, orthopaedic surgery, despite its inherent risks might be offered if the surgeon concludes with the patient that their quality of life can be improved. Such assessment and subsequent surgery also takes place to ensure that there is less likely to be a demand on health services in the future and to maintain a healthy workforce. “Healthy body” 5 words Pain free Unattainable Mobile No medication Strong Person or image of healthy body. Describe I don’t have a particular image of my own creation, but media depictions will vary for men and women, although everyone with a healthy body will have perfect white teeth and will run care free across the sand dunes down to the sea!! Body size will tend to be below average and the person will be white and dressed in “smart casuals” Identity Ethnicity and class(including education and occupation), have all provided privilege in my ability to access health services. My class and gender had a negative impact when attempting to seek help for my child. On one occasion, a consultant said that my child had clearly rehearsed his answers on the way to the appointment, and several years later I saw the letter sent to the GP in which I was described as an anxious mother. The condition whilst not life threatening had a significant impact on my child’s school attendance, his physical and mental health, and has continued in to adult life. Being middle class and university educated make it more acceptable to be knowledgable about one’s own body, and thus believed by some health professionals. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have no firm memories of learning about health and or wellbeing in childhood and adolescence or indeed young adulthood. Decisions related to health and wellbeing were based on “how ill” you felt. I became aware of the book “Our Bodies, Ourselves”, whilst at University, but didn’t really think of it as relevant to my personal health and wellbeing, but more to do with developing a deeper understanding of the many facets of feminism. Maybe my reading of it has contributed to my current attitude to health and wellbeing despite my lack of early memories surrounding health and wellbeing education. My first real experience of health education was when I was pregnant when midwives would talk about relaxation, eating healthily and whether work was having a negative impact on self care. However despite this it still wasn’t acceptable to ‘show weakness’ at work. This is the same as any lack of consideration for the experiences that women have at work when menstruating or dealing with the menopause. It’s as though being aware is the education and then the message is to get your head down, don’t complain and certainly don’t show weakness as it will be held against you. This is not unique to women as men will often disregard warning signs from their body and seek medical assistance too late. Curiously despite or maybe because of in many instances dubious ante natal care, some women learn that they have to listen to their body. Both my parents were responsible for my health and well being when growing up, my mother mainly on the health/medical issues and my father with wellbeing in terms of exercise, partly because my mother wasn’t ever interested in sport or exercise whereas my father had competed in national level competitive sport. We always went on holiday throughout the year in the family caravan, so I suppose as the emphasis was on fun, relaxation and activity that could also be considered wellbeing. I have no recollection regarding any discussion around health. It was only ever really mentioned if I was unwell and the question arose,”are you well enough to go to school”. I think really though although this sounds brutal and I know that the asthma that was diagnosed in my late 40’s resulting in almost a year off work was not diagnosed when I was a child, this was quite typical in the 1960s/70s. Although I think my approach is different to theirs, I don’t think my mother has really changed as she has aged, for instance ignoring the warning signs when she had 2 strokes even though she says now she knew what was happening.  At the time wouldn’t “allow” an ambulance to be called. It’s as though some people regard “illness” and asking for help as a moral failing. The only health education at school was within O level Biology when we studied female menstruation, so bad luck if you didn’t do an exam course in Biology and be taught by a particular new and young member of staff. Shocking as it seems that was in 1976. Magazines were the greatest source of information which on sex education and relationship issues, although I think now I would regard those magazines as a means of social control rather than education, through their normalisation of socially conservative views. I think initially it’s about observing others. I remember in the final year at primary school, in the days when everyone changed for PE in the classroom, that 2 girls changed in the girls’ toilets and the general consensus was that it was because they wore bras, but in retrospect I imagine their periods had also started. As we had no health education at school I don’t think that anyone even knew what questions to ask. My classmates were not particularly interested, but I suppose being in a class of 42 pupils meant there were plenty of other things going on to divert us. I remember starting to be aware of breast development and feeling embarrassed, which in reality was due to confusion and lack of knowledge, and also getting a first bra which despite these feelings was no big deal and indeed seemed quite normal. The idea of there being any ritual associated with puberty in 1970’s Britain seems quite laughable when emotions of shame and embarrassment were prevalent, and perhaps expected. Secrecy disguised as discretion was expected. I suppose what’s especially bizarre is that I’m not completely convinced that we all really understood why we bled every month and my overriding memory is the inconvenience and having to carry sanitary towels to school. What is so sad is how long it took for us to feel comfortable talking to our girlfriends about menstruation – I think not until we were about 15. I suppose this might have been affected by the fact that I attended a co-educational school, were curiously there was platonic mixing between years groups and gender. I remember my first period because we were on our family summer holiday, and memorably the next summer I remember looking forward to staying on a lake and going swimming, but then having to sit around in the heat wearing shorts because of bulky sanitary towels. I recall a woman asking why I didn’t like swimming and my mother clearly explained to her, and nothing was said to me so consequently I just felt very exposed and vulnerable. I suppose it was perhaps the first experience I had of not fully owning my female body. I felt awkward and embarrassed, and fat. Growing older As I’ve previously mentioned, I never regarded  “Our bodies, ourselves” as a book about my own personal health, although that doesn’t mean that it didn’t affect how I felt about health and wellbeing. The personal and the political collided for me when I became pregnant, and in common with many women even today nearly 30 years on, it seemed that my body became public property and people (curiously men more than women)felt able to touch without asking, and ask intimate questions. I found this deeply unsettling. Like many women when pregnant, I was desperate to find out what was happening to my body. A combination of a badly managed birth where I wasn’t believed about my instincts about my body’s readiness to give birth(not ready) and being told that I should be pushing(I wasn’t fully dilated), changed me forever and I became more aware of my own health and its fragility, and that my ability to articulate what I feel is wrong and ensure that I’m listened too is critical when seeking assistance if the help offered is to be of any use. Googling ailments and health issues is the route to nowhere, but if a clinician gives me a diagnosis I will attempt to access medical research papers, and I will always fully check any medication prescribed(having been prescribed valium by a GP who I trusted when a student for a sore throat, when I should have asked what I was being given and why). When first diagnosed with asthma, I would reading forums as a lurker as it was reassuring to know that, for instance, other asthmatics also experienced symptoms similar to mine which are categorised as atypical symptoms. Another critical moments was experiencing miscarriage, something that is discussed only after it has happened – something else that for women to feel guilty about? Having experienced miscarriage, women will(did) discuss miscarriage, but generally in my experience to share what for many is an event which is painful, confusing and traumatic, especially if it happens more than once. I felt that I didn’t necessarily have the words or indeed the voice to speak, and the magnitude of the experience tends to be played down as though you’re an embarrassment. Having a hip replacement aged 49 and having previously been off work unwell for 9 months aged 46 emphasised the fragility of “good health”. However I was fortunate in both cases to be cared for by professionals who listened to and believed me. I also fully appreciated the benefits both psychologically and physically of regular exercise when I was pregnant, especially the general fitness derived from swimming and its therapeutic benefits. It’s about the only activity now where it’s impossible to carry a mobile phone. Apart from two trips to the beach in September, I’ve not swum since August 2019 because of orthopaedic surgery and Covid restrictions. I miss it so much and even now when anxiety builds I forget that I can’t just go to the pool. Swimming is central to my ability to relax, and so the consequence of not swimming regularly is that I find myself taking more migraine rescue medication. I think being a migraine sufferer has also made me increasingly aware of my body, as migraineurs constantly try and find a reason why a migraine strikes at a particular time and why it is a specific, but varying, type depending upon possible triggers. Migraines also illustrate perfectly the interconnectedness of different aspects of physical health and that it is impossible to separate physical and mental health. Maybe a good example of where health and wellbeing overlap. It’s impossible to say whether my attitude to health and wellbeing will change in the future. My body already imposes some constraints, but it’s not something to be angry about, it just is, and I hope that I will take the same approach to any restrictions that will inevitably come with ageing. I hope that I don’t become deluded and deny and consequently have trouble accepting the limitations of old age. Pain is very debilitating and exhausting, but I hope that I won’t deceive myself into the belief that age will have no impact on physical and mental capacity. I hope being aware of changes overtime to date will prepare me. Health, wellbeing and appearance People’s perception of the health and wellbeing of others is bound up with appearance and appearances. There’s something so disheartening in being told “but you look well” when that’s the last thing you feel. It simply means that the other person can’t deal with talking about your concerns. As women we’re told that we’ll feel “so much better” if we put on some make up. I’ve sat in hairdressers and been told that I need colour in my hair to help me through the winter and that it will help my complexion. I’m 59, wear no make up and have white hair. If I feel stressed or unwell I know it shows in my face and my hair will be lacklustre, but putting on layers of foundation will not make me feel physically better. If I look old, then maybe it’s because in reality I actually look my age. It’s curious that it’s considered to be a compliment to be told that you don’t look your age as if this is something that is within an individuals’s control. As soon as there is sun I now that I will catch the sun and that I will “look better” even if this can in no way be an indication of fitness or good health. However when it is sunny, the air is more likely to be friendlier towards my lungs so I should look “more well” than I would in the depths of winter. So the decision is whether I use make up to disguise the impact of the winter seasons and damp weather so that others can say I look well. Hmm – for whose benefit? Another aspect of appearance where some have fixed views is about an individual’s weight, and again many feel it’s acceptable to comment on another’s weight. “have you lost weight?” • good, now you’re attractive and fit and healthy. • bad – “but you didn’t have any weight to lose”, so you’re starving yourself and deliberately compromising your health. Not only do some feel they can comment on body size and shape, but will show disgust which is then justified by commenting that the person is deliberately damaging their health by being “overweight” It would be a nonsense to say that I have never been influenced by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance. It’s possible to say that any personal decisions to change one’s appearance are to please oneself, but that could be a little naive. Also anything that might seem like body autonomy is indirectly being influenced by convention as sometimes it could be perceived as a statement against convention and popular ideals. One of the most pervasive popular ideals with respect to external appearance in particular for women is that it is wrong to show any body hair,  and even the hair on your head is not yours to control and requires “expert management”. I know women who fail to understand(and get angry with themselves) why they pay vast sums of money to a hairdresser, say they’re delighted with the result, go home and wash their hair and might also take scissors to finish the “look”. I became increasingly frustrated with my own compliance and whilst I don’t cut my own hair, I go to the local college so that students get practice in cutting and “styling”. I’ve not visited a high street hairdresser(or is that salon?) for about 7 years. Going to the college with its turnover of students has also emphasised to me the myth that there somehow exists a special relationship between “client” and “stylist”. Although the therapeutic benefits of hairdresser chat should not be underestimated for some and undeniably the skill set of a hairdresser includes sophisticated interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, it is equally true that many people find the necessity for such a relationship highly intrusive. I will admit that I do find the pressure to remove body hair difficult to resist, although I’ve never had any body hair professionally removed. I wasn’t always so compliant-in the early 1980’s I think that feminism taught us what a nonsense it was to shave legs and professional hair removal was not prevalent. A change occurred in my own feelings towards compliance in the era of the power dressing and professionalism at work, despite continuing to resist makeup and stilettos. Some women say they wear lipstick for themselves rather than others, and I sometimes feel that because we’re now allowed to say we look a certain for ourselves, that it can put pressure on women who don’t want to conform to society’s norms on appearance. Tribes are stereotyped and vitriol is still heaped on women who will not submit to the beauty industry’s manipulation of appearance through consumption of a myriad of lotions, potions and services. Rogue hairs on the chin have to be plucked, the quaintly named bikini line maintained if you dare put on a swimming costume, legs and underarms shaved. A measure of the pressure that women feel is how we embrace high denier tights, not just for warmth, but to cover body hair and have some respite from never ending hair removal. Visible body hair is somehow regarded as something to be embarrassed about and also has connotations of a dirty body, sometimes eliciting disgust. The power of the beauty industry can now be witnessed in the pressure put on men, which was unheard of 30 odd years ago. It’s all about business and profit. Making any of us feel inadequate makes us vulnerable and susceptible to manipulation, and increases the likelihood of compliance for a variety of reasons – a bid to gain acceptance, to avoid unwanted stares. It’s hard to say what the influences were on my parents and their generation(born in the early 1930’s). No one could really afford many clothes, and beauty products and personal services are recent creations. I think that perhaps a powerful influence, especially for women, was the ability to buy clothes once rationing finished. The ideals perhaps were markers class and gender in an era where heavy and manufacturing industry were the norm and women were homemakers.  I do remember the idea of “going” out clothes – dressing up to go shopping in London, going to the theatre, habits that they didn’t carry with them so were of the time but are still in evidence in society. However even though some people  still “dress up” to go to the theatre, there is not an expectation that it’s the norm. The only product I would miss would be a fragrance free moisturiser to deal with the tightness and flakiness of dry skin. I do use other particular products mainly because they don’t cause skin reaction and thus avoid the use of medication. I have a pot of green concealer which I’ve only used a few times to cover reactive skin if I have to be indoors, for instance at a meeting with people I don’t know, mainly to avoid unsolicited questions and looks, but I usually forget to use it and certainly wouldn’t bother when I’m with people I do know. I suppose, irrationally, I think I might not be taken seriously with florid cheeks Getting ready to leave the house Going to work for my parents and myself was more about ensuring we had all the necessary books, marked work etc for the day ahead, so I have no strong memories of ritual associated with appearance. I do have memories of my parents going out to dinner parties, parties and sometimes dinner dances. There was no ritual I was especially aware of although they would wear different clothes and I think my mother would have been to the hairdresser. Dinner dances involved dinner jackets and long dresses, but I must have been particularly unobservant as I remember little else except there always seemed to be a bit of a rush, so I suppose I kept out of the way. Maybe there was some good Friday night television! When I was still in full time teaching my ritual would start the night before to make sure my clothes were on a hanger so that there was no decision making the following morning after leaping out of the shower and before organising the exit on time of the entire household – breakfast, packed lunches, phone calls to arrange pickups etc. In contrast to my parents, evening socialising might be preceded by a shower and a change of clothes but not really anything special. Any socialising I do is in informal settings so the notion of dress codes is completely alien in my life. I actively avoid anything formal as such events make me feel uncomfortable, and maybe part of that is an expectation to look a certain way and wear specific clothes. The difference over time is that without the imposed constraints of the workplace I find myself in fewer situations where any judgement of my appearance will be a distraction (unlike in a classroom with teenagers), and also ageing makes me care less and less what people might think about the way I look. I’m likely to just get indignant, and say something back, if anyone feels they have the right to comment upon my appearance."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Neither my partner nor myself have been unwell over the last ten weeks. Bad hay fever this year might have caused us on occasion to think that we had covid 19 symptoms but you just have to try and stay calm and ask whether this is really any different to normal. The changing advice on symptoms also makes it difficult to know quite what to look out for. For instance, in the last couple of weeks there has been reference to loss of taste – with blocked sinuses from hay fever poor sense of taste is also something I’ve experienced. I think ultimately as an asthmatic I tend to know when I don’t feel quite right, so I have to think that this judgement is sufficient even at the moment. I think at the start we were particularly on the lookout for a high temperature and unusual headache. I would say there was a heightened anxiety for both of us at the start of the “lockdown” period and also leading up to the imposed restrictions, not concerning ourselves but primarily about how we would be able to support both sets of elderly parents, late 80’s, at a distance of 70 miles. Whilst this is still a constant concern, a pattern of ordering food, keeping contact etc has now been established. Initially though these concerns are what caused the greatest anxiety for us both resulting in fatigue, poor sleep, strange dreams and short tempers! I suffer from migraine which ordinarily would have been better controlled with an imposed routine with regular meals, hours and not going far from home, but I experienced a cluster of migraines which it was difficult to shift especially as my sleep was so disrupted. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. I’ve had no need to access health care, but I was due to attend a hospital appointment for post surgery physio. This took place over the phone and I was then sent videos of exercises. Because I’d previously had appointments and have seen significant improvement in strength and movement, this was more than acceptable, but I think I would have felt differently earlier in the process where it was critical for a physical examination to assess my needs. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I would say that my emotions feel quite “normal” for me now. At the start of the shutdown though I felt more unsettled. Listening to news items on the radio could cause me to become tearful. Now I feel that my response is of being deeply moved, and then angry that so much of what has gone wrong could have been prevented, for instance if the health service had not been cut to the bare bones. Ordinarily I’m involved in local politics and we would have been out campaigning for the now postponed London GLA and mayoral elections. I’m frustrated that at a local level we don’t have a way of challenging the nationally defined and politically charged messages. Locally there has been a campaign to save out local hospital, and I wonder whether the clap for carers will be transformed into the local electorate realising they have to fight to maintain our service. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? The government continues to say it is guided by the science, but this is meaningless and nonsense. On the face of it, the decisions made appear to contradict the ideology of the current government, especially the economic decisions. Ultimately though the government had to induce a recession to ensure that thee was so little activity that people, if not technically in total lockdown(as was experienced in Italy for instance) believed that they were, in order to curtail people’s activities and thus prevent the infection getting out of control. In the last week the government is now trying to kickstart the economy again. Some people seem willing to go along with this -some because they have no choice to maintain their livelihood, others because they just want to go out. I fear that some think that because they’ve stayed at home that they won’t catch the virus now, and so their resolve to continue social distance has diminished, so potentially the decision to ease lockdown could result in another spike. Perhaps this is deliberate, as politicians such as Iain Duncan Smith show their callousness and brutality when interviewed. He is categorical that there is no choice but to return to work, and he seems to suggest this regardless of the consequent number of lives lost. One decision that was clearly politically motivated was that relating to the funding of Transport for London(Tfl). Numbers using the tube have dropped by (?) 90%, so successful with regard to social distancing and ensuring that key workers can get to work safely, however the resulting loss in revenue has meant that the Labour London Mayor had to seek a £1.6 billion bailout package and the associated conditions will be politically damaging(the mayoral and GLA elections have been postponed a year to May 2021). He will be required to put restrictions on free travel for the over 60’s, increase fares and possibly remove free travel for children. Transport is one of a few areas where the mayor can make decisions for London and this has been taken away from him in a politically way as other European cities have subsidised public transport. A major scandal has been the way in which the government has shown a disregard for the lives of the elderly and the vulnerable. Even before there were any restrictions on daily activity, the public was told that Covid 19 was like a seasonal flu and that anyway it was only the elderly and those with underlying health conditions at risk. The message was that these lives were dispensable and many who fall into these categories were given the implicit message that valuable ventilators would not be used to attempt to save their lives. These groups have been left in a no win situation – those in care homes are still struggling to obtain tests, as are staff, and whilst residents were starting to die in outbreaks in homes, the government continued to say that there wasn’t a problem. People were discharged from hospital to care homes without being tested and consequently were still covid positive and returned still capable of transmitting the virus. The lack of availability of suitable personal protective equipment(PPE) continues, showing scant regard for the lives of workers. Care homes have had to pay inflated prices as the government does not supply them directly. Carers have been unable to get tested, with many so worried about residents and their own families that they have moved into the care homes. There is now evidence that those of BME heritage are at increased risk from the virus and despite this being evident in the disproportionate number of deaths of non-white health and care workers, the government merely announces this as a “risk factor”, with no suggestion as to how BME workers will be protected. Increasingly statistics are rolled out and statements made which fail to show even a pretence of compassion. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Despite what is currently being said, I think that there is likely to be a return to some form of “austerity”. Although it makes no economic sense to think that the debt which is building from, for instance furlough payments, should be paid off, particularly as current low interest rates mean that servicing the debt is low, the Tories will struggle to stop themselves saying that the country can’t afford it. It’s likely that labour laws will be relaxed further and the rights of workers further eroded; possibly the minimum wage will be frozen. However there is a distinct possibility of an L-shaped recession, so if the economy is going to do more than bounce along the floor, the government will have to make decisions about how they can increase aggregate demand. Politically it would be damaging to increase direct taxes for those already in the upper income tax bracket, but if they choose to increase regressive indirect taxes then inequality will worsen. To limit benefits for the unemployed and the low paid will deepen and prolong the recession, but unfortunately I don’t trust this government not to do this. They might consider a hypothecated tax, from income tax or more likely national insurance, but in reality any of these measures will merely give the illusion that they are attempting to “bring the deficit down”. There have been numerous comparisons with the 2008 crash. This morning I heard George Osborne interviewed and he made statements such as “the country will be poorer” suggesting that we are yet again being prepared for significant public sector service cuts, benefit freezes and stricter eligibility criteria for benefits, as the government will want to quickly withdraw from the government ownership, payment of wages and nationalisation that has taken place. They will argue that state control will stifle enterprise, that the country can’s afford the debt etc etc. The sectors now centrally organised will be returned to the private sector in the guise of dealing with the debt, when in reality hedge funds and financiers will be given the chance to purchase equity at significantly reduced prices. Unfortunately, rather than saying this is a global downturn, the government will go out of its way to hold its ideological ground and “bribe” (for instance with further deregulation of the labour market) those already with wealth and resources at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly. The project to conclude the privatisation of the NHS will be hastened, as we are told that it is unsustainable to run at a “loss” a hospital/GP practice/community services/ social care etc. The Thursday “clap” for carers is a useful distraction to mark the passing of another week and stops serious questioning about the underfunding and privatisation of the service which has resulted in health, care and other workers dying because they went to work and were not given the correct equipment, facilities or testing which might have saved their lives. This week the government, after much pressure from its own back benchers, to allow those workers in health and care who are defined as “migrants”, to access health care without paying the surcharge. Not only have the logistics yet to be arranged, but the surcharge is to be increased to over £600 a month in October, and sadly I suspect those workers will then be told they have to pay the charge yet again. Footnote: this weekend the story has broken about Dominic Cummings breaking the lockdown in April to travel with his family from London to his parental home in Durham. With announcements due this week about possible relaxation in rules the media and government have become preoccupied with this story. My main concern is how this will now affect guidelines in the coming weeks. People are angry, upset and showing a loss of confidence in the “leadership”, and there’s much talk of “one rule for us, and one for them”. Generally people will comply with restrictions on their lives if they perceive they are not being singled out and victimised, and this story completely destroys this tenuous bond of trust. A sense of equity has been, and is, pivotal to such a high adherence to the “lockdown” measures News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I tend to listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 for a couple of hours from its start at 6am to catch up on any developments from the previous day and for international news especially anything that has broken in the US. I briefly read the Guardian online, but not every morning and then the next regular source is the Channel 4 news in the evening. Occasionally I’ll catch the 10 o’clock news and/or Newsnight, but won’t stick with either it feels like mere repetition, or just too much of a platform for the government’s message. I made the decision very early not to keep track of rolling news as it could have been too overwhelming. I’m also concerned about being led to believe something because it fits with the message of the day, particularly by the use of photos, so I prefer to let the news “mature” and allow myself time to reflect. I’m aware that this is at odds with rolling news and constant drip feeds and chitter chatter from social media. I’m especially impressed by the reports that Victoria Mcdonald presents on Channel 4. I will sometimes dip into twitter to see but I don’t tweet. I have no alerts on my phone so am not constantly scrolling. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I watched them in the first week, and now sometimes dip into a live audio broadcast. If there is a specific set of policies that are to be announced then I’m more likely to listen, specifically if the chancellor is speaking. On the whole they appear to be a front for the message of the day, and by having a member of the cabinet standing between “2 scientists” there’s an attempt at creating an (unconvincing) illusion of science guided policy which is beyond politics. The broadcasts have become less palatable to watch as it is so clear when the front politician is lying. So many mistakes have been made and so many deadlines missed that it is astounding that they continue to sound so emphatic. Questions are on the whole inadequately answered and when pushed if something will take place(for instance testing in care homes) the words used are carefully chosen – “an aspiration” or “tests are available” Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? This has not touched me personally, but I remember mentioning to my partner that in one news bulletin Bolsanaro had someone signing, and wondering why the UK government didn’t especially as the Welsh and Scottish briefings do have interpreters. The response from the UK government a couple of weeks ago was that they were looking into this(what was there to look into?) but nothing has changed, which is unacceptable and says something truly disturbing and yet unsurprising about the attitude of those in charge. Accessibility is still seen a luxury which is an insult to all those affected. The lack of BSL signers is unfortunately just one example of the problems many are experiencing– ASD, those with mental health issues, those with learning difficulties, the visually impaired, elderly carers and so on. Information was also not circulated in braille, and I know from local media that a couple who are visually impaired didn’t know what they should do as they had not seen the government’s advice, and consequently one of them died as he didn’t get to hospital on time. The elderly mother of a friend has had some problems specifically at the start. She is severely visually impaired, lives on her own, and is in her 90’s. He has been arranging Sainsbury’s deliveries for her for several years mow but he was suddenly unable to do so as she isn’t considered vulnerable according to government criteria. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I’m not in paid employment so I’ve no immediate direct personal experience of this. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? My partner and I are very fortunate as neither of us is in paid employment and we have no school aged children. We are fortunate to have a garden and 2 separate downstairs rooms so we are able to escape from eachother if we need to! Pre pandemic we chose to spend our days together so we haven’t been forced into an unfamiliar situation. We have many shared interests and with the benefit of the internet it’s possible to pursue these ad infinitum. Having said that, we are also both self sufficient and equally happy to spend time apart even if the distance is only by being in separate rooms. Usually we spend a lot of time exploring and doing things in London, getting around by public transport and on foot. We still walk a lot, but the focus is on exercise rather than exploring, although in the last week we’ve researched and explored a couple of local (hidden and unmarked) archeological sites. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? This hasn’t arisen, I suspect primarily because there has been no driving force from the workplace which previous experience suggests is where the impetus tends to come from eg my introduction to email many years ago was at work where I used it before using it at home. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? Keeping in touch regularly has been with family, and friends without work commitments. I’ve not used any new methods to keep contact(and would not use Zoom anyway) tending to stick with the method that I’ve always used with different people. It has made me realise that I do keep in touch with different people in different ways – phone, text/sms, email and WhatsApp. We have a WhatsApp group of 4 close family members, and then I only use it for 2 of my closest friends – curiously one who lives very close by, and another who moved away from the UK a couple of years ago. If so, what has this been like? It’s made me realise that I use WhatsApp for a chat with people I’m close to. I also like the ability to share, especially photos, with ease. I don’t post on any platforms, although I lurk, as I don’t feel the need to be “out there” and so WhattsApp provides a more managed intimate way of keeping contact, mainly because of who I communicate with rather than the nature of the App. I’ve always felt that WhattsApp groups which to date I’ve resisted joining can be intrusive and overwhelming. Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I checked in on a few people at the start – friends who by the nature of friendship and how it changes over time are people I care about and have known a long time, but our paths cross infrequently. To keep more regular contact now seems an intrusion and would change the dynamic – one friend has returned to healthcare and although I think of him we don’t ordinarily communicate frequently. We had a text conversation when it was announced that retired GPs were being “invited” to return, but since then I’ve held back from getting in touch again as I don’t want him to feel he needs to keep “checking in”. It can be a challenge sometimes just making such regular contact with elderly parents especially when no one has done anything and remaining sympathetic to their situation. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I don’t post on any and am not a FB lurker. I will however, a I always have done, lurk on Twitter looking at the accounts of people who I’ve always dipped into to find different sources of information and reading via links. I have started reading a countrywide community forum as escapism – nothing quite beats spending 10 minutes whilst the pasta is cooking reading a thread called “what’s for tea tonight?”. I’ve always been fascinated by people who prodigiously post anywhere, especially when they start to reveal things about themselves – just as I’m doing here! Perhaps we all need to express ourselves somewhere where we feel comfortable and I like the fact I have a MOA number not a name! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I’ve not been into a shop since lockdown, and although I did occasionally think about popping out to get something, such thoughts are occurring less and less. I started online shopping about 15 years ago, and although I do it less frequently now it wasn’t a huge change for me to arrange this to enable a degree of self isolation. However getting delivery slots for the first few weeks was a challenge and almost became a full time job, at least a preoccupation(and the fuel for a dream/nightmare), especially trying to arrange deliveries for elderly parents and in laws who don’t shop online. We now have a good routine of weekly fruit and veg boxes and a supermarket delivery every couple of weeks, so that I can also order food for a couple of people who are self isolating. I’ve used a breadmaker anyway for 15 years or so, so made sure I had plenty of flour. I’m using the breadmaker more to make dough and then shape prove and bake and cook in the oven because I’m around to do so. It’s enjoyable, the bread is tasty and I’m trying different types. We’re here everyday so dinner is at home and always cooked from scratch. We normallykeep easy food eg a ready meal/pizza, in the freezer for when we go out for the day, or for a quick meal before an evening meeting, but we don’t need to now. I’m cooking a greater variety of meals and looking at recipes – I’ve got the time and I don’t want to waste any food especially from the fruit and veg boxes. I would also say I’m taking more care storing food and keeping the windowsill herbs alive! Because of a shortage of yeast sourdough had its moment which I indulged in. Although the results have been delicious I’m not baking it regularly. I put a starter into hibernation in the freezer a month or so a go and retrieved it yesterday and started feeding it again, so maybe another loaf in a week or so. It seems to be waking up!! Initially the first supermarket delivery was for 4 households which we then delivered – quite an organisational feat. I’ve a couple of friends who can get slots now, and we all check-in with eachother when we have a slot and order items for eachother. My son has worked throughout as a key worker and so I’ve organised deliveries to go there(50 miles away) He is a carer as well so it just didn’t seem right that he should work and then have to queue at the supermarket – the shopping trips having to be frequent as he has no car. Afterthought 28 May 2020 I’m starting to think that the feelings that I had about being thrust into the role of domestic manager are more than just niggles. We’re already seeing that it’s women in the workplace who are more likely to be made redundant but there are signs that there is an increasing burden on women for effective household management. I’ve been considering conversations that I’ve had with friends, all women in conventional stable opposite sex marriages or partnerships. These women are in their 20’s, 40’s, 50’s, 70’s and 80’s. All but the youngest are mothers, and whilst being(or have been) in what would bee considered “professional” jobs, have tended to move more frequently between workplaces and with various mixes of part and full time paid work. Even with adult children it seems that mothers are providing support in for instance getting food. I think the initial shortages and the desire not to enter shops meant we were all furiously organising and planning. It seems to becoming a burden, but maybe it’s just that we’re stuck at home with no escape from partners? There was also a lot of early lockdown house cleaning and tidying by people generally. I woildn’t say that my friends are particularly houses proud, but because this is also linked with hand washing, disinfecting and trying to ensure surfaces are virus free this also seems to be something that’s managed by women. Including ensuring that sufficient cleaning products are in the house. I’m certainly wiping surfaces more frequently than usual(maybe because I’m here) and cleaning the bathroom everyday. It’s drudge so why am I doing it? I need to think more about this and see how it plays out, but I’m getting a sense that women are certainly dealing with increased drudgery, and also that fatal combination of responsibility and some bitterness. A friend said she’d had a “robust conversation” with her husband when we were discussing that “the men” seem to dip into cooking when it suits and don’t take into account that it’s one meal of many in the week when choosing ingredients. Also the default is that we will cook. I’ve much more to say on this but maybe I need to reflect first! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? There was a great flurry at the start of lockdown with people proselytizing about all the life changing achievements we were going to make. I was very sceptical from the start and it seemed it was just a way to generate copy for “lifestyle” pages and gave an opportunity for endless youtube videos. It seemed like some people just couldn’t cope without being governed by the language of scientific management and the need for targets. I also keep thinking that many of these so called projects are merely ways of encouraging people to continue to spend money. We’ve done some sorting and tidying of things that have been niggling for a while, and found cobwebs which normally I wouldn’t bother seeing. The list of thing that we could do around the house has not greatly shortened, but given a free choice I would prefer to read or bake. We walk at least 3 – 4 miles everyday, which is not unusual, and further on other days. I can only think of a handful of days since the restrictions when we’ve not gone for a walk. With the roads so much quieter it’s also felt safer to cycle, which is something that we only normally do when on holiday. I usually swim, but haven’t done so this winter because of surgery, so that wasn’t too much of a shock, although now the weather is nice I do most days think about the joys of sea swimming, which is very important to me over the summer months when we go away for extended periods in our campervan. Oh, and I suppose there’s all the dancing in the kitchen to the music turned up loud whilst cooking and baking. I’ve also been able to be very conscientious about my post operative physio and turned it into a 40 minute workout every other day, with 15 minutes of stretches on alternate days. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I always have a book on the go anyway, but tend to read shorter books so they’re easily thrown into my rucksack, and not too heavy! When the weather has been nice, and as we’re not going out, I’m reading more than usual in the garden(a bit like being on holiday), so I’ve just finished Thomas Mann’s “Buddenbrooks”. It is a hardback, long and heavy, so I’ve been waiting to take it on holiday, but now it will be one of my reading memories of the sunny lockdown spring. I have got more time to read and I think my head must be less cluttered as usual I’m tending to have fiction and non­fiction on the go at the same time, yet m also feel less hurried reading and able to think more deeply about the non fiction whilst still immersing myself in the world that I’m living in through the novels. I’ve watched the first 2 series of “The Wire”, rationed not binged(!), and I’m looking forward to the next one, again not something I would normally commit to. Apart from the news I’ve watched little TV but that’s not unusual. In the early weeks when the evenings were still getting dark earlier, “Bakeoff” and similar light programmes might be on in the background whilst I read the paper online. We usually go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema and also attend public lectures, so at the start thee was an element of “we should have been going to….”. I’ve perhaps listened to more podcasts as a result and we’ve watched a couple of plays online, but neither are substitutes for shared, live events. Podcasts are just different but familiar anyway, whereas I do struggle with watching a play on a small domestic screen, and it’s made me realise how you make your own experience of a play by where you choose to look, whereas the camera does that for you with a broadcast. The result is it takes me much longer to get involved and I’m not convinced I can suspend my disbelief as easily, but having said that, after an initial non plussed 30 minutes, the performance of “A Streetcar named Desire” that we watched last night was totally absorbing. I listen to a variety of podcasts depending on my mood and time from the lightweight (e.g. Fortunately) to the more informative (e.g. Talking Politics, with David Runciman). I can’t abide radio phone ins! The only music radio we have on is Radio 6, as usual, but more of it as I’m at home more and it also provides an automatic disco to dance to whilst cooking. Music is also something my partner and I share – discussing and listening, and hunting out youtube clips. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? The most obvious change is the focus on hand-washing – both frequency and duration – and the resulting need for hand cream. When the weather was still cold I did have an eczema flare up on my hands which was really the only time that hand-washing was painful, and I suppose normally I would have avoided putting my hands in water so frequently. There’s been no significant change, although I’ve noticed that not going on public transport means that clothes don’t get as dirty and there’s not the griminess on the skin which happens when travelling on the tube. The main impact for me, as for everyone, is the inability to get my hair cut. I’d had an appointment booked for March 23, so I’ve not had a cut since 10 Feb. I’m not at all worried about my appearance, but as someone with very thick, short hair it’s uncomfortable in the warm weather, and it’s very obvious that I need a cut. Apart form daily exercise I don’t leave the house/garden I simply use hair grips to hold it back out of my eyes-not exactly flattering but hey The overriding anxiety at the thought of someone cutting my hair is a useful distraction when I wonder which way to try and push my heavy fringe – 4 July is being mooted as a possible date for hairdressers to open, but I won’t be first in the queue. It’s only just struck me that I’ve gone into winter mode for leg shaving – ie not at all! Need to think about that one. Perhaps as we’ve all become a bit more inward looking and isolated it shows just how much pressure there is to have smooth legs, and without social interaction it’s somet"

Have you been ill? Neither I nor my immediate friends and family have been ill from the virus, although like many others across the country some are wondering if they’ve had it, particularly as the symptoms we’re told to look out for seem to change frequently. I suppose there are many reasons for this. Although having had the virus doesn’t mean that future infection won’t happen it is a way of making oneself less fearful of catching the virus. As an asthmatic in a family of asthmatics, levels of anxiety were initially high about becoming ill, especially as my parents who are both elderly, and with underlying conditions, are in a high-risk group. I feel a sense of responsibility to keep them safe by ensuring they have provisions although this is complicated as they live 60 miles away. They along with my in laws seem to have been affected more greatly psychologically than those of us who are younger. This doesn’t appear to be through fear that they will become victims to the virus, but there’s an irrational and unfounded sense that others are continuing to go out and getting the social contact that they are craving. Conversely my son continues to work as a key worker on a zero hours contract through an agency and is distressed at the amount of social contact that he has to endure on a daily basis. As someone in his twenties, he misses going to the pub with his friends but they are inventive enough to use the technology they’ve grown up with to socialise online and draw into the group their friends working overseas. He also misses sitting on the beach. Living in a flat about 50 metres from the beach and being denied the right to sit in your “back garden” is hard. We count ourselves lucky. Whilst some things are out of bounds at the moment – using the bus, going to the theatre, a June trip to Europe in the camper van – we are comfortable in our own home, with a garden and so far have managed to order food online and have it delivered. I have a friend on the government’s vulnerable person’s list, and he has now acclimatised to shielding and being in quarantine, and again counts himself lucky to have a garden. He lives with his wife who struggled initially with the idea that she had to self isolate for his sake. She found it hard -she is in her early 70’s she is fit and active. They have developed a routine, and are perhaps drinking more than usual but are happy, laughing and joking when we’re in touch. More concerning is a friend who lives on her own. She has no family, and being in her 70’s, her friends also have to quarantine or self isolate, so she has become socially isolated. Her anxiety levels are rising, and as an ex government scientist her anxiety is fuelled by her knowledge and therefore enhanced ability to see through the messages the public are fed from government through the mainstream media. Everyone is affected by the virus in some way, and it was particularly frustrating early on to see people trying to outdo eachother in terms of “it’s really hard for me because….”. Also there were instances of politicians going to their second homes/visiting family despite this being in contravention of the guidelines. There was an element of the encouragement of the intergenerational conflict that we’ve witnessed growing over the last few years. Are you doing anything to protect yourself or others from the coronavirus? Have you self-isolated? Have you changed your behaviour? Initial behaviour change was about scrupulous hand washing and the use of hand gel when out and about. This continues, but now it’s also about wiping surfaces and ensuring that anything that enters the house is wiped with antiseptic. We leave letters on the floor in the hall for a couple of days, although recently it’s been said that the virus can’t exist on paper despite previously being told it could survive for 24 hours and then 9 days. It’s an example of where you have to “listen to the science” and then behave in a way that seems proportionate, as there can’t be a definitive answer. The main change on a day to day basis is self isolation and supporting others to self isolate. We go out for the permitted daily exercise strictly observing social distancing. Unless we have food to deliver to a friend (which has been delivered to us) we stay in the house and garden. Our behaviour has undoubtedly changed because going out is no longer going somewhere but taking an ever changing route to avoid other people on our daily walk. Ordinarily we walk a lot anyway but this this might also involve initially taking a bus/the tube/Overground. It feels odd sometimes that tomorrow will be home based but it doesn’t worry me at the moment. The only real concern is not being able to visit our elderly parents. I’ve managed to avoid going into a shop since March 29, and that was just for a few items in a shop operating a “one in one out” policy. My partner and I are both supporting our elderly parents to self isolate by arranging food deliveries so they don’t have to shop even in the special “elderly and vulnerable hours”. Although it’s slightly warping their view of the difficulties others are having it will hopefully give them a chance of keeping safe. A couple of hours at least each day are spent trying to book slots for supermarket deliveries, finding out what people want, ordering, making phone calls to establish what people want, phoning to make sure everyone is alright -and so it goes on. Have your shopping habits changed? Shopping, specifically for food is a hugely significant activity, as I’m ordering regularly for 4 households and help supplement shopping for a further three. I’ve used supermarket online delivery services for about 20 years and also fruit and veg box delivery before the days of online delivery, but stopped the latter when my son was in his teens and the boxes just didn’t have enough fruit. How I’ve used these services has changed over the years as family circumstances have changed. When working and having to feed a family I had weekly deliveries, but in recent years this has become less of a necessity. A delivery has become the exception rather than the norm – maybe to stock up on dry goods, to avoid supermarkets at the end of November and the run up to Christmas etc. Like many we have in the main switched to shopping more frequently I store with a basket of typically £5 to £10 worth of goods. Not only is this more doable with the variety of supermarkets and international shops locally, but also makes sense when no longer having a working household with a teenager (and friends) to feed. Such shopping habits now seem positively scary so the overriding motivation in our shopping behaviour is to avoid entering a shop. The last time I stepped into a shop was in the last week of March. We have had a couple of supermarket deliveries and have started to use a weekly box delivery of fruit and veg. Due to the closure of restaurants and cafés there is a surplus of fresh produce and some companies are now operating from Nine Elms delivering directly to residential premises instead. I share my supermarket delivery slots with several friends, one who is shielding and another who is over 70 who wants to avoid the shops. The favour is then reciprocated, and in fact I’ve just been texted by a friend who has a delivery at the end of nest week and she will add a few items for us. This keeps dairy topped up for us. As she and her husband are self isolating, making the arrangements and collecting the food also becomes a form of “justifiable” social contact and the opportunity for a brief, socially distanced chat on the doorstep. In addition to this are the arrangements for deliveries to be made to parents and in laws, and to my son who is a key worker. The last thing he wants to do after a day at work is to queue in a supermarket exposing himself to more risk. This all takes quite a bit of time but at least it feels useful and that my friends and family are being helped. My instinct when I open my laptop is to check for slots, add items to a basket etc, which although not a great habit is not as psychologically disturbing as constantly checking the update death toll which some people say they spend much of their day doing. I’m very conscious that I’m in a privileged position. I have a credit card, a certain financial safety net, organisational skills, and I’m not in paid employment so have time. I’m very conscious that there are elderly and vulnerable people who have to go into shops or they would have no food or general provisions. I even find myself justifying my actions by saying that any delivery we receive is shared with others which keeps us out of the shops which is better for those who are in the shops. An element of truth but shows a feeling of guilt. Have you noticed any changes in the availability of food or other goods in the shops? Apart from seeing shelves striped bare in a large supermarket in March I can’t really comment on what’s happening in shops. We made one trip after that to the nearest supermarket (in March) for fruit and veg only and there were no supply issues. However even at the start of March shops were running low or were out of stock of soap and hand gel, toilet paper, tinned goods (tomatoes, tinned fruit, evaporated milk!!!) Pasta and rice were also out of stock but readily available in the international shops. At one point there was an announcement that taking ibuprofen to control fever should be avoided so there was a shortage of paracetamol. There have been on-going shortages of eggs and flour, and yeast is still not available. I have a bread maker so always have sufficient yeast but I did start to run out of flour. My main concern about this was that all the time I could bake it was again another way of avoiding going to the shops. I have over the years bought flour direct from a mill and I was able to replenish with an order from them. What this did highlight is that because companies offering delivery were being overwhelmed they were prioritising existing customers. This has been a particular problem for the elderly who are unable to get deliveries, as they have not been users of online shopping. Many can’t understand that they can’t ring someone. This has also discriminated against those on low incomes, many living in housing with limited space for storage. Eggs were non-existent for several weeks causing much consternation, and supply is still irregular. What were people doing with the eggs? Were they trying to store them? Is the issue one of supply or demand? Are chickens laying fewer eggs? And so on. It seems some of the issues are down to packaging differences for the retail and commercial sectors. There are stories that flour exists but it is in 16kg bags for businesses. A friend got 30 eggs destined for a restaurant for £6 when it was impossible to find boxes of six in any type of shop, so packaging seems to be playing a part. I also wonder whether all this flour is going to be used. It seems unlikely that the population has suddenly become bakers, especially as there is no yeast!! For several weeks there were articles on sourdough bread making but these are disappearing. What do you think about the UK government’s response to the pandemic? The government’s response was too slow. People were already adapting their behaviour and realising the seriousness of the virus whilst the government continued to say it was not necessary to give advice. The behaviour of ministers was almost cavalier with Boris Johnson proudly saying he was continuing to shake hands with people. This was on the same new bulletins where we were seeing complete lockdown in China and distressing footage of people on ventilators in Italy. This Conservative government has over the year’s delivered its policies in slogan form to the electorate. Prior to the pandemic the focus was on “getting Brexit done”, and the same approach has been continued. “Help save the NHS”, “guided by the science”, use of the term lockdown when clearly we are not in lockdown in comparison to Spain, China, France, Italy etc. The arbitrary target set by Matt Hancock to test 100,00 people a day reminded me of Blair’s similarly arbitrary target that 50% of 18 year olds should go to university. Testing has been a debacle with health workers unable to access tests or being told to drive to an IKEA car park to queue several hours for a test. Care workers and care home residents have been neglected – no PPE and no testing of residents or staff. Elderly people being discharged from hospital with Covid symptoms back to residential care causing many deaths in care homes. The impact on the workers has been devastating to watch on the news and some workers have even moved in to the care homes where they work in an attempt to protect residents and also to avoid exposing their own families to the virus that they themselves might have been exposed to at work. Some health and care workers are living apart from their family for fear of the risk. The government failed to stockpile PPE in the way that for instance Taiwan did and found itself unprepared for what has been said was a predictable pandemic. It found itself competing globally for supplies that they’ve failed to obtain. Some regard this is as a community spirit, but I’m horrified that school children are making protective facemasks in CDT departments using 3D printers, whilst elsewhere people are sewing facemasks for hospital workers where supplies have run out. This is just plain wrong, yet the feel good media coverage of these activities is used as a distraction. In the same vein Johnson contracting the virus and becoming seriously ill is used as “we’re all in this together”. No. The poorest and those from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately affected in the community, in the health sector and in the provision of other front line services such as public transport. We welcome thoughts about any other countries response to Covid-19. I’m hesitant to comment on what is happening in other countries knowing how the media is being used in the UK to manage policy, so to then assume that the reports from other countries are a reflection of what is happening there might be naïve. In particular I am wary as to how coverage reflects the experiences of the population as opposed to providing a story that their government wants publicised, or alternatively providing a counterpoint for the policy of the UK government. For instance, the term “lockdown” is used indiscriminately – in France it requires the need to carry papers and to move no further than 1 km from home in Paris, in Italy and Spain children were not allowed outside until last week whilst adults could shop and go for medical appointments, yet in the UK the term is used even though there a merely guidelines and recommendations. Are the rules being enforced in Spain? The media coverage suggests yes but then is that being shown to make us feel “grateful” that we live in a “freer” society. Given that the UK government’s mantra is that they will follow the science it is interesting to see the different approaches taken around the world. There is no one science and that comes through in the range of responses, as ultimately the response is always politically motivated. Trump’s USP will be lost when the US economy plunges into a depression, hence the desire to “get the economy going again” in a critical period for Trump if he is to secure a second term In the Whitehouse. And of course even Trump knows the US’s economy will not be booming in time for the election so now he has to blame China. He can’t afford to lose those voters who supported him in 2016 because if they don’t vote for him they simply won’t vote thereby giving the advantage to the Democrats. The Chinese response through the use of technology, by downloading a smartphone App, to permit greater freedom of movement sits comfortably with a more authoritarian regime, although this also seems to be the way the UK government is moving. Where do you get your news about the virus? In the early days of “lockdown” I was getting news from anywhere I could and in particular found myself looking at the Guardian updates far too frequently throughout the day. Now I listen to Radio 4’s today programme from 6 – 8am. There tends to be no breaking news but it does cover any new stories from the States that have broken. My other main source is Channel 4 news. I avoid all radio phone -ins. I don’t use Facebook and just lurk on twitter. If a news item has broken I’ll then tend to look at people’s twitter accounts that I consider might have something useful to say. At the start everyone seemed to be watching the daily briefings which I never really committed to regularly as they seem so choreographed, so again once I know what the message of the day is I might then watch or listen later to original clips. I don’t feel a need to keep up with rolling news as I’m not sure it’s particularly good for anyone’s mental health, and the amount of filtering that is required with imperfect information at my disposal is draining. I feel C4 news does provide some analysis, as does Evan Davis on Radio 4 on the pm show, which is starting at 4.30pm. I don’t listen to the latter every day but might dip in on catch up. Essentially there is little news that is new news as there is only one story and it’s pretty easy to predict what will be said as there is a pattern to the day. There also tends to be a daily angle – do we need to be scared? Do we need to think we’re better than other countries? If there’s bad news make sure there’s a distraction etc. Have you noticed any jokes, memes or sources poking fun at the virus? I’m not aware of any that have entered the main stream, but as I’m not on Facebook I might be missing something. There is a tendency for those on the left to point out to people that the difficulties faced by the NHS and therefore ultimately patients are because people voted Tory and therefore voted for cuts and endorsed the privatisation of the NHS that has taken place. I suppose it’s just all too dark. Maybe one thing that people are joking about is “lockdown hair” as there are no hairdressers or barbers open. People are perhaps confronting their own vanity. Also it becomes noticeable if someone appears to have had a haircut. It’s something that people laugh about – people of all ages. Afterthought written on 9 May 2020 I had decided not to add anything to this entry as we’re now in week 7 of the so called lockdown and tomorrow on 10 May the prime minister is due to make an announcement regarding any relaxation or tightening of government advice, so I’d thought that this in itself might change how I feel. A couple of days ago the media started to pre-empt the announcement with the Sun talking about Super Monday (ie 11 May) when there would be a relaxation of guidelines. This was worrisome given that there was to be an exceptional bank holiday on Fri day 8 May to commemorate VE and the weather forecast was for a sunny warm weekend. Very quickly ministers were attempting to counter the optimism suggesting any relaxation would be minimal eg 2 daily sessions of exercise instead of one, whilst they were simultaneously explaining that the people needed to go back to work. I’ll find out tomorrow what will actually be announced but I wanted to note this because of the impact on the VE Day commemoration and what happened in the road that runs at right angles to our house along the garden boundary of our corner end of terrace house. Flags and bunting were being put up from Thursday and yesterday there was what can only be described as a street party. People started off in their front gardens, moved onto the pavements, spread out on to the road and as the day wore on neighbours were in eachother’s front gardens. A sound system was set up so that the whole road could hear the music and people were dancing. Adults who were drinking lost their inhibitions so any notion of social distancing went out the window, and children couldn’t believe their luck as they were allowed to play freely together in the street. Eventually after 11 hours of partying, and barbecues, the last stragglers went inside at 10 minutes before midnight. I’m aware that this account makes me sound like a killjoy, but I was deeply disturbed by the whole event. It has also divided people into two camps. The mainstream media, the BBC, was apparently reporting similar street parties with no comment about social distancing whilst Twitter was buzzing with tweets from people who like me could not believe what they had seen. This incredulity turned to rage especially when medics at the end of hard shifts started to see what had been going on whilst they were working to treat critically ill patients. This is also juxtaposed against the weekly clap for the NHS where people apparently show their appreciation of the hard work of frontline workers by standing at their front door on Thursday at 8pm and clap. I worry that what happened yesterday will haunt us, not only in a second spike in cases particularly in London, but will enable politicians to put the blame on the population, or a group they want to scapegoat, as showing a “lack of self control” which in reality was encouraged by the Tory popular press. And meanwhile there is still the deadline of Dec 31st for the completion of trade deals with the EU. 9 May 2020"

There have been a couple of times where we have worried that we might have symptoms of Covid19, such as my husband having a cough and one day where my son went back to bed with a temperature. My emotions have been very up and down throughout the lockdown period. At times I have felt a kind of contentment, a feeling of enjoying the lack of pressure to do things and be somewhere, a feeling of being safe and happy with my small unit. At other times I have found myself in tears over something seemingly trivial and overcome with frustration at the never-ending nature of this situation. The ‘homeschooling’ situation has been a big challenge for us all, with poor support and a lack of direction from the school, a child trying to make sense of it all and me desperately trying to make sure he doesn’t fall behind in his learning. There have been days where we have shouted at each other and both been in tears, with others where things have gone more smoothly and we feel satisfied with some small progress. Government I have felt angry and disappointed in our leaders. There has been indecision throughout, a lack of clarity over what is expected of us (especially as time has gone one), a withholding of supplies for care workers and a culture of blame as cases and deaths have increased. As we move on, it seems clear that industry is being prioritised over health and we are pretty much being told to take responsibility for ourselves. Boris Johnson really does seem though, to be self-congratulatory over how the pandemic has been handled. I worry that lockdown restrictions have been eased too quickly at a few points, with a strange priority being given to activities such as horse racing and professional football, where really, people would simply like to be able to see their friends and family. It looks as if lots of power will be handed over to local authorities, with they and individuals being expected to take responsibility for them/ourselves. News I have been accessing news mostly online, looking at the Guardian and BBC websites. I listen also to Radio 4 and watch the news on TV sometimes. I was watching the briefing every day at first and checking the news regularly, as things were moving quickly. I started to feel frustrated with the format of these briefings, with too much waffle and not enough clarity. I chose, instead, to summarise the facts for myself through the media listed above, focussing on what is important to me and trying to filter out other information to keep myself sane. Work and home life I have been working from home, kind of. My work couldn’t physically happen at first, so my employer (I work freelance, on a contract), cut my hours to two a week, with my wages being adjusted accordingly. This has changed slightly as time has gone on, with my hours increasing a little and my pay coming back up – the work is being carried out from home, in an admin capacity. My husband has been working from home since before lockdown, using our spare room, where he is constantly on video calls, working intensely and only appearing for meals. His hours were cut to three days a week for a while, but he is now back to five days. I mentioned above about homeschooling, which has been my responsibility. There has been tension at times, with frustrations building up and the lack of having ‘something to look forward to’. Technology I really dislike video calls. I find them stressful and uncomfortable. I have, of course, had to get over this and we have been having a weekly ‘family call’ with my husband’s family. This is nice at times, but I don’t always want to do it, finding it tiring and repetitive. We sometimes do a quiz with them, which lasts for hours and I can see is now wearing a bit thin. We would never normally see these people this much, so it can feel a bit forced at times. One positive thing is that my husband and I spent a few hours getting my mum signed up to WhatsApp so that she can do video calls with us. It was a real challenge, but we got there in the end and she was delighted to see us. On our son’s birthday, she and my dad did a video ‘party’, where they had made cakes, wore party hats and sang happy birthday. We also organised a surprise video party for our son and his friends. I do use Twitter and Facebook to keep up-to-date and to stay in touch with friends. Shopping and food As I have asthma, my husband offered to do the shopping. We had a few small deliveries at first, but it was so difficult to book these that he has been cycling to the supermarket once a week. He has worn a mask and taken a cloth to wipe down the trolley throughout. At times this has been very busy and stressful, but things seem a little less so now. I have recently been to local shops, to buy bread and it is nice to see other people and have a chat. We always cook from scratch anyway, so this isn’t a big change for us. For me, it is odd having my husband and son at home for lunch, so I tend to eat more than I would when I am on my own during the day (this has resulted in weight gain…). My husband has been making sourdough bread – he had done this previously, but is doing so more now. Entertainment and leisure I don’t think our entertainment and leisure have changed that much really, maybe we watch a little more TV in the evening. I usually read a lot, but have found it very difficult to focus on reading much. We sometimes rent a film to watch, as if we were going to the cinema and we have tuned in to the National Theatre Live events. In terms of fitness, we are normally an active family, so this has been challenging in many ways. I normally swim a lot, so have struggled with not being able to do this. We have walked most days as a family and I now get up early to walk by myself when it’s quieter (I find it stressful when the park/paths are busy). My son and I have joined in the PE with Joe Wickes sessions, completing every day until he reduced the sessions. We have a turbo trainer and my husband and I have put our bikes on here and used this (though we both find it really boring). Personal hygiene My hygiene habits haven’t changed. To have a sense of routine and normality, I was very strict with my son about getting dressed every day for ‘homeschool’. I think it is important and has helped our well-being to take care of our appearance. We have all had the huge hair growth, with my son cutting my husband’s hair a couple of times (we have both decided to go with the longer hair ourselves). I have actually enjoyed this, embracing the new look, which I think I will keep. Sleep My sleep has been very up and down. I have had bouts of sleeplessness and had one night where I had what was probably a panic attack – I had to get out of bed and was sobbing uncontrollably, I felt overwhelmed and took a while to calm down. I have had lots of weird dreams. Sometimes these are quite day-to-day, sometimes frightening (having a bird stuck in my hair, which died, climbing a very tall ladder that feel away from under me, swimming the English Channel…). My husband has also had sleep changes and odd dreams and our son sleep-walked the other night, which he has never done before."

Part 2:  Everyday Health and Wellbeing H, Wb and the healthy body HEALTH means the absence of discomfort and pain, over a few days.  Transiently a stubbed toe or bruise may be uncomfortable or painful but that is compatible with Health.  A truly healthy person will probably be aware of lifestyle factors which might reduce Health, and will probably minimise them. WELLBEING is a neologism which I have recently met mainly used as a synonym for Health, with especial reference to freedom from STRESS.  Stress is now a dirty word not fit to be used in public; this is absurd.  There is an International Stress Management Association with an active operation in Britain but even its members prefer to avoid using STRESS now, favouring Wellbeing as more POSITIVE!! Not all neologisms are good. Five words on Healthy Body:-Fit;     Strong (meaning disease-resistant);  young;   undiseased;  free; and one more I have not yet thought of . . . . . Maybe . . . Surrounding a Healthy Mind. ! There are probably people who will say Young;  I think that is wrong and that I am an example to prove my point ! There is no person that comes to mind, save an advertising figure in the 1950s whose splendid physique promoted -something or other.  I can't remember what. (?Virol?)  I wasn't interested in physique. %%%%%%%%%%A quick WWW search (NOT via Google, which I hate) yeilds:-Virol was a by-product of the brewing industry packed full of nutrients, malt, sugar and vitamins such as riboflavin. Due to its concentrated nutritious content, Virol has been heavily marketed... %%%%%%%%%% and that supports my recollection. Identity  and Key moments I do not believe my experience of H&Wb has been influenced at all by the factors you mention.  I am a product of those factors and others that you mention, of course. The only one that may have been pertinent is my British birth and upbringing, mainly after the creation of the National Health Service when I was ten years old.  I have been blessed with outstanding service from the NHS, especially as a consequence of my needs after two head injuries from different accidents 17 years apart.  My file at  Hospital is large! Growing up and learning about H & Wb  is what I have been writing about just above. When I was a child my parents were as careful about looking after the health of us all (including my younger sister) as any normal middle-class family.  Perhaps a little more careful, as I believe my father belonged to something called The Saturday Club which ensured attention if we walked to the Surgery in the village we then lived in.  I got  four stitches in my left index finger when I was about nine, because I had been clumsy using an axe to prepare firewood for the open coal fires which were our >only< source of heating. In adolescence I could not ignore the changes in hair associated with the age.  I took them for granted.  I guess my father taught me to shave, with a 'safety razor' as it was called to distinguish it from the long straight blade, often still used then.  I cannot pretend I noticed my voice breaking; had I been a singer I probably would have.  That was life. Maintenance of health was for a very long time spontaneous and not deliberate.  As a boy I used my bicycle automatically to get around all the time, whether to explore nearby woods and river.  We walked V3767 as a family, and did so on holidays in England and Europe, including French and Swiss Alps. We did not have a car until I was 15.  So bicycle when alone and feet as a family; that was life. Growing older I think I have made clear above that an adequately healthy life just happened to me.  In about the last ten years I have been using the trampoline in our garden as a form of exercise.  My wife bought it, ostensibly as a 70th Birthday Present for me.  When new it radically altered the behaviour of visiting grandchildren.  Before, they announced their arrival with loud cries at the back door.  After, the parents would enter and announce their arrival more quietly.  But I digress. As long as its surface is dry I go out and do the simplest possible action; Bounce up, and Land on my bum, and repeat.  I have been increasing the repeats, and now usually do 100, breaking after 20 to get my breath back. The limit, as when I run, is breathlessness and not muscle pain.  My wife observes that muscle definition in my thighs is clearer that it was.  Since we are on the subject, I weigh very slightly more than when I left school.  I just dug out my Service Record for my two years of National Service in the Royal Marines; it shows my height, waist and chest measurements, but not my weight.  I know it was close to 64kg when I left school and it is no more than 2kg above that now.  My waist has thickened. Reverting to changes with age, I have never actively worked to maintain my physical health except in the modest way I describe above.  Neither have I ever done anything to maintain my mental health.  But I did get some training in Transcendental Meditation in 1971.  It was very popular, wholly voluntary and free of pressure.  So for two years or so I meditated for ten minutes morning and evening.  I think it may have reduced my tendency occasionally to shout at my sons when they were 5 and 7 and toooo active. I ended doing TM after travelling on business overseas and omitting it and seeing no change in myself.  So I stopped altogether.  I think my ability now to get back to sleep easily after waking in the night probably has its roots in that training. So changes in my life associated with my health have been small and easy to make.Remaining points in the Growing older section:-I don't get information about H&Wb now, except in the specific case of Covid-19 which therefore is outside the scope of this response.  The same applies to future changes, unless I contract Covid-19.  I am aware of how fortunate I am to be healthy.  I do sometimes wonder if an influence might have been joining a Snow Warfare course in the Cairngorm Mountains for 3 weeks when in the Marines.  We lived in holes in the snow, literally, with 'Running Cold Water'.  I logged my food intake and concluded I was taking in 6 kcal (6 kjoules now?) a day and found I was putting on no weight at all. So we arrived back in London and I recall feeling so fit I could brush a pillarbox aside rather than walk round it. 'No Pillarboxes were harmed in making that decision'. H, Wb and appearance People more acute than I are good at noticing the apperance of someone in distress.  I am not, unless they are weeping. That is an extreme example. I am almost completely indifferent to popular ideals of beauty or physical apperance.  If I am to appear in public, at a meeting or a restaurant for example, I am happy to pay some attention; I have once or twice even worn a flower in a buttonhole.  I can't think of other examples.  So guess I care, but not very much.  V3767 Getting ready to leave the house  et cetera  -above"

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health My health is good, as is that of my partner. Although, as someone who is taking immunosuppressants for a health condition, he is not allowed out or to meet people for at least 12 weeks, and I am supposed to keep a distance from him too. But we are in good physical and mental health. We are not naturally pessimistic people, and make sure that we get as many facts as possible before coming to any conclusions, so we keep up to date with the news, and don’t get too down with it. In fact, my own interest in modelling means I am very interested in the rate of infection, the death rate, and so on, so that I can see ahead. I know it’s a gloomy prediction, but I am still happier being able to look at the facts myself. I have not had any paid work for over 6 months now, and my partner’s work has also dried up, so we are a little nervous about when and if we will get work again. With last year’s tax to pay off, a mortgage which still has a few years to run, and gloomy business and economy prospects, I am a little on edge about our finances. I am managing to cope by taking payment holidays, but it’s a problem. It’s also compounded by the fact that my self-employed situation means I don’t get any support from the government, and my partner’s self-employment situation means he is assessed for support on the year before last, during which he earned almost nothing, so gets 80% of almost nothing = nothing at all. Worrying. But we are keeping positive, and also supporting some friends who are more affected emotionally by it all. The Government I am frankly appalled by the decisions and strategy that the UK government has taken. (sorry, I didn’t mean to leave the text in bold, but actually it is how I feel!) We keep up with the news from around the world, and in particular Ireland, as we have family and a house there, so can easily compare what different countries are doing. The response, planning and strategy in other countries has been far, far better than in the UK. I cringe every time I hear Boris Johnson say that we are doing really well, are successful, and it’s all under control. Plus, the daily briefings are lamentable – a host of ministers who haven’t got a clue mumbling on instead of giving us facts that mean something. I worry about the current strategy – saying that people should return to work if they can, but without giving firms the right equipment, support and guidance. I really fear another spike in infections and deaths. The news last night was that the actual death rate is more like 50,000 instead of the 31,000 reported as deaths where a person was tested for the virus. With the current back-to-work strategy and noticing people’s response and behaviour in the past couple of weeks, I fear that we will end up with more than 100,000 deaths by this time next year, a crippled economy from having to continually start-stop, and millions of hours of wasted time while the luckier people get sick and slowly recover. Plus massive unemployment due to firms having to lay people off. In terms of what steps I think the Government will take, I haven’t a clue. I hope that they listen to other countries, scientists and public health experts, but they don’t seem to be doing so. News I start the morning with reading all the headlines on BBC news on my phone, and then dip into it several times a day – perhaps 10 or so. I might listen to a news-on-the-hour on BBC Radio 4 if I already have the radio on while cooking, and also the RTE (Irish) news at 8pm on digital radio. Most evenings I watch the BBC 10 o’clock news on TV before going to bed, and 2-3 times a week some of Newsnight. We tend to stop for tea around 4:30 or 5pm, and I used to tune into the radio broadcast of the press conference, but I have grown tired of the platitudes and meaningless statements, so instead head for the ONS or other government website for an update on the numbers. The 5pm briefing is getting more and more ridiculous, and the 7pm broadcasts from Boris last weekend highly farcical. However, I enjoy watching the Facebook memes that apply different voices to the video, or satirical takes on the words being used in the briefings. I am not aware of anyone who has access difficulties, but every time I see Nicola Sturgeon check behind her to ensure that her sign interpreter is ready to commence, I feel proud of the way that the Scottish First Minister understands the value of truth, plain speaking and honesty, as well as the fact that she is part of a team, not a hero. Work and home life My partner and I are self-employed, so work at home anyway. Neither of us has had any proper work for around 6 months or more, but we are both trying to get work. I have teamed up with another small network of people to address the virtual meetings/conferences market,basedonwhatweusedtodotogetherbefore. It’s beginningtogetsometraction,butsadlynothing for me yet in terms of income. There are one or two projects that have been postponed from physical meetings, and we are trying to reconfigure them for virtual sessions, and when (and if) they happen, I may then begin to relax a bit in the knowledge that business will pick up again. But it’s worrying times. Neither of us can be furloughed as we are self-employed. Neither of us is getting any state support for our work, although I did sign on for Universal Income, which has made a small difference. It’s less than 1/10th of my previous income, and doesn’t cover the mortgage, the balance on the car loan and my credit card debt as we entered the lockdown, but with payment holidays we have a little bit of breathing space. Home life hasn’t been affected – we don’t have kids, so no home-schooling, although people who I work with have commitments that means that some projects are slow to mobilise because they have divided responsibilities. Working from home and (sadly) not having pressing work deadlines means that we can spend some time in the garden, which has been good while the weather was good. Our relationship is not affected apart from both being a little depressed by the lack of income and bleak prospects for now. However, we used to go out a lot, both the theatre/cinema/galleries and to eat out, so we are missing all that. Instead we are Zooming and What’sapping friends and family, and continuing to eat really well (my partner is a really good cook and baker.) Technology We work from home, so are used to staring at a screen to get things done. I have bene using video-conference technology in a limited way for a few years, but it has developed massively in that time. Because of the business I’m in (facilitating strategy and development with groups of people) I have developed my use of Zoom, Teams, and whiteboard apps massively, and have developed some products/services for companies to help them run effective meetings and conferences. While this is just beginningtotakeoff,it’s earlydays,butpeopleseemkeenonwhat we are developing. It will either explode or people will realise that they can do it themselves, without the need for specialists. I thank good sense and foresight for the quality of our broadband – we upgraded a while ago and we really need the extra speed! We use all the apps – FaceTime, Zoom (a LOT), WhatsApp and Houseparty to connect with friends and family. If anything, we are reaching out to people a little more now – we used to rely on going to things like the theatre together, but now we hook up with cocktails and snacks in hand. One observation, though: it’s great to see people, but the chat is banter, not really as deep as a one-to-one on the phone, where you really get to hear how someone is feeling and thinking. Video doesn’t really do emotional reactions. I use Facebook to keep up with friends, but strangely I refer to it less often than I used to. Not sure why – couldbethevolumeofmessagesandthewallofsocialnoise. Maybeit’sbecausepeoplearen’tdoingreally very interesting and novel things, so it’s all a bit same-y. Hmmm… not sure I don’t use twitter much, and Insta not at all, but my partner is a very big user (and is followed a lot) on Instagram, so I get second-hand posts when they are of interest. Shopping and food Online ordering has been a major struggle but is getting better. We have used Ocado for years, and that used to be the main shop each week. However, we found firstly it was almost impossible getting a slot, and then lots of things that were missing like flour and sugar. I am sheltering my partner (he’s on the vulnerable list) so I have been trying to go to the shops as little as possible in order to minimise the risk of bringing an infection back to the house, but it is inevitable that I have to do some shopping locally. That hasn’t been much of a problem, but queuing to get into M&S Food is a novelty. So is wearing gloves and now a face mask when shopping. Not a problem, apart from having to deal with lots of other people who don’t seem to be distancing or protecting others from the risk of infection – there are some gross idiots about who don’t or can’t understand the health risks and real community infection threat. Wefinallygotmypartnerontothecritical list,soTesco’snowoffershimapriority slot, and Ocado now gives me a priority slot each week, so we are managing to get orders. We have also found local wholesalers who have switched to domestic ordering and delivery, which is good. We are foodies, and love to cook – my partner especially –so we tend to shop and eat very well indeed. We bake all our own bread (have done so for a very long time) but getting bread flour has been a real struggle. Our grocery bill used to be around £350 a month and eating out £600-800. Now the grocery bill is £700­odd! We are also drinking a lot more wine, but that probably balances out with the reduction in bar bills when out before. We area also making cocktails for Zoom chats whereas we would have met in a bar somewhere. The lack of exercise, good food and wine has meant that we are now not very fit, but happy! Entertainment and Leisure We haven’t taken up any new hobbies – being self-employed means that I have to focus on trying to get work until it’s time to stop and cook or eat. However, we are at last managing to get to the back of the garden at weekends, a place that was abandoned a few years ago during a home extension project, and we are clearing, weeding, sorting and rebuilding – especially since the weather in April has been exceptionally good. It feels good to be sorting out things, and beingpositive. Lotstodo,buthopefullywewillgetthetimetogetitallsorted. I’malsomanagingtoaddress some DIY jobs that haven’t been done over the past few months, which is good. Also, having to lay off our cleaner means that we are spending several hours every fortnight cleaning, which is hard work but we are combining that with spring cleaning the areas that the cleaner never had time or inclination to do, so some top shelves in the kitchen and space under the bed are getting a proper clean, which feels good. You really appreciate how hard and tiring the work is, and the reliance on professionals! Our watching and listening habits haven’t changed much, but we have been watching series like Money Heist, a Spanish thriller, and Killing Eve. We are watching a few things that we would have gone to see, like 5x15, a monthly series of interesting talks, and a couple of music recitals that we would have gone to see. Not an enormous change, although I do feel that the world is awash with events that are now virtual, and it makes it difficult to choose which ones to watch. Wearen’twatching,listeningorreadinganythingparticularlyrelevanttotheCovidperiod,butwe didwatch Chernobyl at the start of the lockdown, which was really good. Personal hygiene There has been practically no change to personal hygiene for either of us. Just 2 differences: - I now spend more time trying to tame my hair: it used to be cut quite short every 4 weeks, and now  it’s wavy/curly, unruly and 6 weeks overdue a cut  - My consumption of aftershave has dropped to nil, as we don’t go out  Sleep My sleep has only been affected in one way: because we are eating very well, and I am not getting any exercise (I used to just walk hard and fast everywhere – no other exercise) when I go to bed I end up with indigestion and discomfort most nights. But I am sleeping well despite this and no difficulty at all in getting off to sleep or waking with anxiety. If anything, the lack of work means that some mornings I sleep 8 hours, which is a lot for me, so I am managing to half-wake and see my dreams (no, I can’t recall any now). I still go to bed around 11:30 every night, and get up between 6 and 7:30 am. No nightmares, but I sometimes wake thinking about work pressures or potential client situations."

Thus having a healthy diet, not smoking, not being overweight, doing exercise seem to be the key ideas to sustain this. “Wellbeing” could be defined as more of a mental health sense of completeness, satisfaction, happiness and positive mindset as opposed to a physical state of being. When I imagine a healthy body, the five words which immediately spring to mind are healthy BMI, muscle definition, happy. People which spring to mind are some of the YouTube and Instagram fitness guru’s like Joe Wicks, Heather Robertson, jodieloufitness. I see them doing exercise a lot, eating wholesome healthy food and they look not too fat, not too thin weight wise, have a bit of muscle definition, they look happy and confident in themselves. I feel that gender and social class has played the biggest role in my own health and wellbeing.  Being middle class has given me the finances to be able to have the ability to choose a variety of foods, buy organic foods, buy foods based on health qualities not just on cost.  My education has meant that I research and understand food labelling and actively try and equip myself with the best knowledge about health based on research.  My degree has meant that I am able to critically analyse research and decipher out the most important findings. It means I can afford a TV, the internet and a Smartphone and laptop where I find out the most about these things.  The fact that I am a British citizen in a developed world makes me grateful that I have access to a free NHS, plentiful food, clean drinking water, good shelter and a stable environment-all factors which can be paramount to a person’s health and wellbeing.  My gender has impacted on my health.  My hypothyroidism developed in the postnatal period and I became aware I had acute anxiety issues as a result of having a baby. Pregnancy and childbirth also left its legacy on me through piles, ligament weakness and mild incontinence.  The upshot of pregnancy however is that it brought yoga, hypnotherapy and an understanding of my mental health issues into my life which I developed into an interest for mindfulness and created an awareness and need to prioritise self care especially in terms of mental health to match the desire I already held about keeping good physical health. Having children, breastfeeding them, being the one that they always turn to first has had a negative impact on my health and wellbeing in one respect thatit is time consuming and doesn’t allow “me” time or time to exercise or plan healthy meals.  In the same sentiment though, the love you feel for your children and the socialisation with other mothers that you have is good for your mental health.  I think women in general are a lot more able to talk and share their experiences with physical and mental health to get more help and support. Is that provoked though by the very fact that society places more expectations on women’s body image and how we should or shouldn’t behave as a woman and that we are still breaking free of the historical barriers which as a sex we have been subjected to thus this is the reason our mental health is worse in the first place? My skin has never been very clear, I have a degree of acne and when you describe a healthy person you may automatically think of clear skin. I know I am a healthy person with a healthy lifestyle so I’ve had to debunk that myth myself.  While I don’t particularly like having spots, I don’t feel it has decreased my self esteem and feel fortunate that as a female I can wear make up more easily than men could to hide the spots.  Maybe my mental health and self confidence would have suffered more as a man with acne. I would say that I have only become aware of wellbeing as an adult over the last 10 years.  The importance of mental health was never really matched to the importance of physical health in society.  It was classed as something to be ashamed of or brushed under the carpet when it was discussed.  Self care was never a thing until the past few years, especially in motherhood.  Women were expected just to cope, you’ve made your bed, you have to lie in it mentality.  On a privately funded study day about hypo birthing 10 years ago I learnt about the power of the mind and how it could influence the physical body which sparked my interest in learning more about wellbeing in terms of holistic therapies and mindfulness. Health was taught to a degree at school.  I remember in my GCSE home economics I had to work out fat/fibre/sugar content etc... per gram from food labels and we learnt about each food group and what benefit or harm it had on our bodies.  We had projects to cook meals with certain requirements such as low fat which did make you more aware of health in cooking. As a child I remember my mum hampering on at home about my sister and I needing more protein as we had chosen to be vegetarian and it always seemed like she was on a diet, counting calories and being mindful of eating low fat foods. We rarely went out to restaurants so all the discussions would be done at home. At primary school age however I feel I was unaware of health.  Sadly I don’t think we were ever taught about wellbeing in school or at home, that is something I have come across myself and researched as an adult. As a primary school governor I know that health and wellbeing is part of the national curriculum now which I think is fantastic and greatly overdue.  Schools are an integral part of a child’s life and share that responsibility with parents and the government to teach our children about health and wellbeing.  The fit for life campaign by the government will only work if other parties like parents can embed itinto the child’s life As an adolescent I think I first became aware of body changes associated with puberty around age 8yrs due to having a sister 3 years older.  I heard conversations about periods and bra’s and saw sanitary wear from my mum and sister left out.  I learnt the vast majority of things from Sugar magazine and sometimes friends but my mum did attempt to give me the period talk and chipped in a bit about deodorant but it was very minimal.  I just had to embrace changes as they happened and knew they were normal basing it from looking around to see if they were happening to my peers too! I feel puberty needs to be discussed as an earlier age to prepare children for it happening.  There are such great books on the market now that discuss both physical and emotional changes and I feel the more open you have the discussion the better placed the child is to come back with any questions.  I don’t necessarily think rituals like buying your first bra should be important as I feel they shouldn’t be made a big deal out of, but what I do feel is that we mustn’t make it a negative experience for the child.  Including them in decisions, asking what they want to happen and acknowledging their emotions would be sufficient if they are already feeling self conscious about body changes. I found it all embarrassing and just wanted to get the logistics over with quite frankly.  It was uncomfortable discussing things with my mum and I think a stranger in school who didn’t know me would have felt less embarrassing.  I have always been keen on doing exercise, both in school and as an adult.  I was part of the netball, hockey and tennis teams at school and loved to go cycling in the countryside around our village.  Since then I go to the gym, have played in an adult netball team, do exercise classes, go running and cycling. I feel it is integral to my life as I have always done it and enjoyed it.  Since covid 19 hit and gyms were closed I have done more exercise classes online in my home which I have equally loved as they are just as hard, more convenient, cost free and you don’t even have to go outside in the cold! It is making me contemplate whether I will continue my gym membership in the future. Since my mother’s cancer diagnosis myself and my husband have actively tried to eat healthier and eat more vegan, raw and less sugary foods.  We were fairly healthy before but the emotional pain that the diagnosis has created spurs me on to keep healthy so Iwill live along time so my own children don’t have to prematurely go through this heartache.  Similarly, it has made me focus more on my own wellbeing, learning how to manage and cope with stress better, listen more to mindfulness, meditate etc..This will in turn help my mental health. Through the research I have done for cancer healing I found the importance of micronutrients, reducing harboured stress, alternative therapies and diet quite powerful.  I recently also did a health DNA sequencing analysis which highlighted any predispositions to certain health conditions and gave sport, skin, nutrigenics, pharmacogenomics reports which did guide my choices of diet to a degree, though I thought it would have had more of an impact on them. Nowadays I get health and wellbeing information from articles on social media and companies’ emails as there is so much out there.  I am definitely more aware of my body now and what it can and can’t do and how exercise, diet, stress can have an impact on it.  Pregnancy and labour had taught me how it can change and create and sustain life of another human which is mind blowing.  It forced me to be patient being thatI couldn’t do the same type and intensity of exercise as before and taught me the first lesson on sacrificing your own wellbeing for the benefit of another. In the future I expect health and wellbeing to be more readily accessible and convenient in your own home more and affordable to more people.  I think the government will play a more active role in health promotion through reducing carbon emissions, thus promoting veganism and continuing to influence the media and companies in things like increasing sugar, alcohol/tobacco tax and setting stricter rules on food composition and health standards.  I feel that in the future I will most certainly turn vegan, be able to do more exercise once my youngest child is at school and I will have the time to prioritise my own wellbeing. I can’t see my situation changing in old age unless I am hit with a serious disease as it is so ingrained into my life now.  Health and wellbeing are related to external appearance to a certain degree as your body’s condition is affected by them.  Being obese or negatively thinking will be a catalyst for the manifestation of other disease like heart disease which will have the physical appearance of a red face or breathlessness.  Saying that however people can still have good wellbeing and be unhealthy and visa versa. I used to be more into going on sun beds and fake tanning than I am now which was a popular idea of beauty in the 90s and 00s.  I would much prefer to have wrinkle free skin now than get a snubbed tan. I have followed fashions a bit like getting permed hair in the 90s and plucked my eyebrows but as fashions these change so much.  I loathe how social media, fashion magazines and porn portray to people, especially younger generations, how they should be looking and what is deemed normal and attractive.  Idon’t think it has enough cross section of bodies and diversity of anything. I know my mum was influenced by TV and magazines of the 80s in her quest to be slimmer which in today’s climate was just the start of the influence social media has on people’schoices and body confidence and choices. I’m currently trying a lustre blue light therapy unit to help with my acne as I really don want to use any drugs to try and clear it up, time will tell if it proves successful.  I love the Calm app to help with my wellbeing and listen to it daily.  Any other product I use is usually organic and with an Eco slant from brands like Liz Earle, Neil’s Yard and Weleda. It used to be quite exciting seeing my mother get dressed up for parents evening or for a rare meal out. This is probably the only times she wore perfume so the strong scent of Youth Dew was associated with mum looking all fancy and applying lipstick and grandma babysitting us! She would use a hot brush to style her hair and sit at her bedroom dressing table to apply make up choosing a variety from selection tins of lipstick and nail varnish. There certainly wasn’t as much make up application as people do nowadays! She always wore a skirt or dress in the 80s, I can never remember her wearing trousers then. Downstairs she would look in the lounge mirror to see if she looked fat in her outfit and have a side ways pose breathing in and stroking her tummy flatter!! I am amazed that I don’t have an eating disorder now after seeing this so frequently as a child! My routine has changed through time as prior to kids I could spend longer getting ready and drink alcohol while doing it. It could be a whole afternoon showering, curling hair, fake tanning, trying on different outfits and doing make up.  Now I haven’t got that much time to get ready for going out so my hair styles and make up are less adventurous.  I’ll always apply perfume, foundation, concealer, eyebrow pencil, eye shadow, mascara and lipstick or gloss but it may not have the finer detail to it like lip liner or eye liner, contouring the eye shadow shades or putting highlighter on. With my hair, it may go up or straightners used as I haven’t got time to curl it. I won’t try outfits on anymore and just think this’ll do!If I can’t be bothered to shave my legs then I’ll just wear tights or trousers instead.  Getting ready in covid 19 times has been even simpler! I don’t even straighten my hair anymore, just whip it back into a frizzy mess of a pony tail.  I don’t put on make up nearly as much anymore now as mask covers most of my face and I seem to live in comfy clothes like jumpers and leggings.  Standards have definitely slipped substantially in covid 19 times mainly because I am hardly seeing anyone or going out so think why bother!"

Autumn Directive 2020: Part 2: Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body “Health” is a priceless asset that we probably only value sufficiently, when we have lost some of it. Now that I am 72, I know that how the rest of my life plays out will depend to a great extent on how my health holds up. Two years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I have been well since then, but I have learned that good health is not guaranteed. Imagine a healthy body: fit; agile; not obese; energetic; functioning. I am thinking of myself, but in the past – by now, I have developed a droop in my posture, so I resemble the old people on the traffic sign. I used to be upright and healthy. Identity I can’t be sure, but I think my paternal grandmother had a stoop, like me. But she was only in her early sixties when she died (so my memories of her are distant) and I wasn’t much affected by that age. I worked in an office for almost twenty years and that certainly didn’t help my posture. I used a computer frequently (I still do!). I think I have kept my health in other respects, partly because of my social class and education – I have never seriously smoked, and I only drink in moderation. Also I know about the importance of exercise. (I am fortunate there, because my husband is a keen walker and so I go walking more, probably, than I would otherwise do). I think my experience of health has been overwhelmingly influenced by my gender! Most of my experience of health care has been in relation to gynaecological events or conditions. Breast cancer is mostly a woman’s disease.  Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I remember my mother’s pregnancies when I was five and nine. When I was nine, the baby suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen – home birth, an undiagnosed breech. The baby also had a severe cleft palate. He died at three weeks. I learned a lot at that time. Later, there was a polio epidemic and my younger sister’s best friend had it and was hospitalised, and suffered some lasting effects. We learned a lot. We were examined at intervals by the School Nurse, accompanied by a doctor, I think. We were also examined and sometimes treated by the School dentist. We went to our own doctor for routine injections; he called at home if we were poorly and in bed. Our parents were responsible for looking after our health and wellbeing. I remember my parents talking to me about why the baby died, also about polio, and other health problems that people had. When I was eleven, my younger sister was diagnosed with epilepsy. I learned about that. Mostly I learned because my mother used to talk things through with me. I was interested, but it was also because she needed to talk about these things.  I expect we had some elementary health education in primary school, but I don’t particularly remember it. I do remember it in secondary school; it was “sex education” there. The class would be divided and the girls got the talk and filmstrip from the visiting nurse, about menstruation. We were all given a booklet from Kotex, a leading manufacturer of sanitary towels. Subsequently  the whole class received “sex education” about reproduction, to everyone’s embarrassment. Filmstrips again. Questions at the end, when people thought up the weirdest things to ask about. I don’t think there was ever anything that came up in the sex education lesson, that I didn’t know already. Fortunately. In the first year of secondary school, a friend of a friend whispered to me (and the friend) in the playground, “Do you know what fuck means?” No, we didn’t. “It’s what a boy and a girl do when they make a baby”. Oh. I was impressed, particularly because the girl that told us, was, I knew, adopted, having been born illegitimate. (She herself had told us this). My mother was a teacher and before her marriage, she had been on a course in teaching sex education. The course textbook was removed from the bookcase by me and I used to read it in bed, pushing it to the bottom of the bed under the bedclothes between sessions. I was twelve at the time and I remember reading with solemn interest the recommended ages for introducing various topics to schoolchildren – generally somewhat older than I was! The book was helpful and informative. In my teens, I read girls’ magazines, though I don’t think there was much there that I didn’t already know. The advice on health and beauty was sound. Thank goodness, we didn’t have the internet or anything like that. I’m talking about the fifties and sixties. Key moments I was the eldest of three girls, with no brothers. I don’t think much fuss was made about reaching puberty; I didn’t have any physical problems with it. My mother was sympathetic and made sure I was OK. She bought me lipstick, nylons and shoes with kitten heels when I was thirteen. We lived in the country and there was no opportunity to go shopping on one’s own – nor would I have had any money! I always went to mixed schools, so didn’t get “silly” about boys in the way that girls in a single sex school often do. Growing older In retirement, my husband and I have had more time to spend on keeping fit. We joined our local Leisure Centre and used to go to classes two or three times a week, before the pandemic, as well as walking regularly. Fortunately we are able to continue with the walking. There are many sources of information on health and wellbeing available to us, from the government and NHS advice, through radio and television programmes and articles in the newspaper or in magazines. You can also look up these same sources online. I don’t think anything has changed in my awareness of my body. I don’t expect my approach to health and wellbeing to change in future, although I know that my body will change and I may develop health problems. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think external appearance is affected by vitality more than by health or wellbeing, although of course they affect it too.  Yes, I think I have been influenced by the fashions of the times! Perhaps most, with hairstyles. I like a sleek bob now, but there was a time when I had an Afro perm – and oh, it was so easy to look after! Yes, I think my mother was influenced by fashion, my father much less so. My mother, to the end of her life, used to powder her nose and check her hair before leaving the house or receiving someone. (I can’t say the same!) I couldn’t live without toothpaste, and either soap or cleansing cream. For washing my hair, I need either shampoo, or conditioner which does the same job. I do possess two lipsticks (both the same colour!) but I haven’t used lipstick since the pandemic began – I put some on the other day, before a Zoom, but it seemed so strange that I had to wipe it off. I possess some face powder too, but I’ve not been using that either. My secret pleasure is my perfume – Hugo Boss “Orange” – I enjoy a squirt of that most days. I’d like to find that on my Desert Island. Getting ready to leave the house I’ve described my mother’s powder and lipstick routine, but she also used to put her hair up – what a performance. She had set up multiple mirrors in her bedroom. She used various aids, such as combs or hairgrips, and a firm hold hairspray was needed when she’d finished. I didn’t pay much attention to my father’s routine, but he always smelled nice when he’d finished (though not of aftershave; I think it was just soap!) My own routine depends on the time available, and I am often to be found in the passenger seat of the car, applying lipstick when the road is straight and  fumbling around to get my earrings in. I usually take shoes with heels with me and change on arrival. Eye makeup makes me look terrible, I haven’t worn it for years. When I was teaching I used to take a bit more trouble; when I worked in the office, probably less! (it was definitely a back office). The routine for “leaving the house” nowadays involves, more importantly! checking on vital items such as reading glasses, mobile phone, purse or credit card, etc and just at the moment, MASK."

Wellbeing means more to do with your mind and how you are feeling mentally. A healthy body in 5 words -fit; glowing; looking good; happy I do not think I could name one person to describe a healthy body although I think the Duchess of Cambridge probably fits the bill. I believe that women are probably more aware of health and wellbeing than men are, they are the ones who normally take on the role of caring for the family so it is very important that they stay healthy. It was probably not until my mid 20’s that I thought about staying healthy. At that time many prominent stars were coming out with keep fit videos and also I was getting back into being more active. Wellbeing on the other hand I don’t really think became recognised until more recently and yet it is almost as important as that of your health. When I was growing up my father had very little to do with our health, this was handled by my mother as I imagine it was with most of my generation. It was still considered that men would go out to work and women would look after the family and we were no different. My mother was definitely a person who would carry on regardless of how she was feeling and that was instilled in my mind, although having said that the same could not be said of her treatment of my father or indeed my brothers. She cosseted them all, which needless to say I resented. I don’t recall her ever talking to us about our health, she always ensure we were well looked after, well fed(probably too well fed) which resulted in me being rather overweight. However I do remember her joining the League of Health and Beauty and I went along as well, probably I was around 10/11. I know we wore white satin blouses and black satin shorts. From what I can recall and also seeing old footage, I think it was a combination of exercise and dance and was choreographed. My mother loved dancing so probably this is what spurred her on to join. Once I was married I was able to control what I ate and so lost the weight although its always been a battle. I am afraid my school days are so long ago I cannot remember whether we had any health education, if we did it certainly wasn’t considered that important. Sports was considered part of our education and was compulsory and I certainly joined in. We also had to have cod liver oil which is truly foul presumably because it was considered good for our health. Trying to recall changes associated with puberty is taxing me a little. My mother obviously explained to me about periods probably when I was around 11, and I do remember getting my first period, but around that time my youngest brother was born after a gap of over 9 years between him and my other brother. I went to a girls school and I know we had biology lessons and obviously I was aware of changes to my body but here again it is so long ago the actual memory is hard to recall. I suppose I was excited to get my first bra although I was never particularly well endowed. I wonder how my granddaughters would feel if they were asked the same questions. They do seem very much more open in all aspects of their lives than we were. Looking back I think my mother was quite embarrassed to talk about anything to do with our bodies, this of course could have been due to the way that she was brought up. I suppose it was in my late 20’s when things started to change for me, this would have been in the early 70’s. It probably was when famous film stars started producing their keep fit video’s that I became more interested in keeping fit and plus we moved to Dubai and I started playing netball again and as they say one thing led to another. Since that time I have tried to keep fit, mainly in an effort to keep my weight down, not due to a health aspect but rather I wanted to stay trim. I know that I went through a stage when my kids 2 MO NO: P1796; Female; Age 74: Married; Bridport; Dorset Retired had to go to boarding school in the UK and I started to struggle with not seeing them. My husband was a way a lot and I seemed to be torn between missing them but actually loving living in Dubai. However I was lucky that I was able to work which helped. Since then I have always tried to do exercise and in fact I now probably do more than ever and I am inmy 70’s. We are all encouraged to do more to keep fit and I am glad to say I have found a lot of friends around the same age who feel the same way. It has been apparent with the Covid 19 that it can make a big difference to how you cope with the virus depending on how well you have kept fit. I regularly read up about keeping healthy and fit in both papers, internet, social media and of course TV. Although obviously with age one has to take care of oneself but as long as I can do the workouts, the running, cycling that I love I will continue to do so. In fact when we went into the first lockdown I could no longer go to the gym so I took up running again, not my favourite form of exercise, but I need some variation. I had given up years ago due to my knees giving me problems but I decided to give it a go and in fact I am amazed that I now regularly run 5kms even in the winter and my knees seem stronger. How long this will go on for I do not know. I believe in having as many interests outside of the home is very important for one’s wellbeing and I also like a challenge to try something new every year, although I am running out of ideas. However I have really enjoyed having time to spend on our garden this year, something I normally had to fit in. Although we cannot do anything about ageing I do think that if you keep active, have lots of interests it is reflected in your outlook and you just look better. I look at some older people who basically have the view that once they get to a certain age then they just decide that their live is over and just sit around. They don’t want to try anything new and they seem to close their minds. I must admit having grandkids around encourages you to keep up to date. My mum certainly paid close attention to how she looked and she was still swimming regularly until her late 80’s, but my Dad found life very different once he retired as he had no other interests in life. As my skin is not very good, mainly due to having spent too many years in the sun, I do need to have a number of different products to keep my skin in relatively good condition so I would hate to be without them. I would also hate to be without my make up as I always put my make up on every day regardless but I suppose I could live without them. Hard to pick a Desert Island item but I suppose mascara followed by close second of eye shadow. I really cannot remember my parents getting ready for going out, my mother didn’t work, and my father I presume would have a wash and shave and after having breakfast leave for work. My mother always used to have her hair done if she was going out for a special evening and she certainly made an effort with her clothes and being very particular about everything matching, something I hate to admit that I also like. I have always had, and still do have a shower every morning, washed my hair and blow dried it, put on my makeup before starting my day regardless of whether or not I was going out. I continued with this routine all during lockdown as it is just part of me. If I am going out I will probably spend more time on my makeup. This routine really hasn’t changed over the years although I probably don’t spend as much time getting ready to go out as I used to. 3"

Mass-Observer P1796 describes themself as female; age 73; married; retired.;The Directive 'COVID-19 and Time' was issued on 7 August 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in relation to the 'rhythm and routine of the day'; 'homelife'; use of 'media and technology'; their experiences of 'waiting'.,"PART 1 - COVID-19 AND TIME  Rhythm and routine of the day. Indeed my daily life and routine have definitely changed beginning with the lockdown when I only went out of the house each day for exercise and to pick up the paper, that was the extent.  Compare this to pre lockdown, when I was out and about all the time, rushing from one place to another and always trying to find some spare time.  So how would I cope with all this spare time, well amazingly well which really surprised me.  Ofcourse the weather was glorious in the lockdown which was a huge benefit, as for the first time I was able to spend time in the garden and the allotment, something I really enjoyed and needless to say the garden and allotment benefitted.  I could no longer go to the gym or swim but I needed exercise, although I previously did cycle a couple of times a week.  However I had to get into a new routine, so ended up cycling 4 times a week and jogging 3 times a week, I love cycling but not keen on jogging.  I went out first thing in the morning around 6.30 and it was lovely, very few people around and they ended up becoming regulars. I would then pop into our local Spar en route home and pick up the paper wearing gloves but no mask.  Big change here as I needed to pop the outer pages of the paper in the microwave to disinfect it, not sure whether this was correct but seemed like a good idea.  At 10 am we would stop whatever we were doing and have a coffee and read the paper; here again so different from before, when I was lucky if I had time to read the paper when having a coffee.  At 11am my husband would go for a walk as he needed some exercise and it gave me the opportunity to get onto the computer and keep up with any admin I needed to do.  At 12 we would have lunch and then around 2 would head to the allotment for an hour, back home for cup of tea, make supper, and then watch TV.    We did see our neighbours from a distance and would chat to them and then we started Facetiming our family and then Zoom became part of our lives.  At the time of lockdown I was President of our local Inner Wheel Club and I decided that if we couldn’t see each other face to face, we needed to see each other virtually.  I had never used or in fact heard of Zoom but I soon learnt how to use it and got a regular weekly session going.  It was lovely to see ladies, who up until then had not really used their computers/tablets/phones for anything like this, really get into it and enjoy it.  As well as doing a weekly Zoom meeting, I also started a weekly newsletter to all the ladies telling them what I was doing, what was going on and asking them to reply stating what they were doing to pass the time.   I feel I got to know some of them a lot better during this time and was actually quite sad when with the end of my year as President in mid July I no longer did this.  As my husband and I are both retired we obviously were not involved in the furlough scheme, however 2 of our grandchildren were, and 1 still is I am sorry to say, but hoping that this will end in September, he needs to be back at work.   We live by the sea, in a very popular area for visitors, and the road outside our house can get very noisy during the summer season.  We both loved the fact that there were no cars on the road, the quiet was heavenly, we could hear the birds singing.  So then lockdown was eased and everything changed.  People started arriving, roads got busy and the harbour was packed and our lives started changing again.  However certainly not back to normal and in some ways this is harder, as people seem to want to push the boundaries of what you can/cant do and yet the virus is still here.  It has been lovely of course to see our family who we have missed, and we have had some friends over but certainly nothing like before and we are both reluctant to go any further.   I have now gone back to the gym twice a week but here again very early, and with the restrictions operating for gyms, currently there are usually only 6-7 people, so feel comfortable with that. We have to pre book our sessions which last 75 minutes, but having to clean all the equipment each time you use it, means that the 75 minutes go by quickly.  In addition our gym is now in 3 seperate areas which adds to the time. In addition we have started netball training, all within a 2 metre square which is kind of weird but better than nothing. Lovely to be able to go to the hairdressers and beautician, and for my husband to be able to play golf and get some more exercise.  We still haven’t been out to a restaurant.  We have taken day trips out to a number of National Trust properties and have enjoyed a change of scenery, but when you live in such a beautiful area it is not so important.  Here again you have to pre book your entry time to the NT grounds, but we haven’t found this too much of a problem.  Homelife There are just the two of us in the household, and I think I have already described how we have spent our time during and coming out of lockdown.  I definitely enjoy having more time to myself and wonder how I am going to cope, if and when they get a vaccine, and we can get back to more normality. I miss being able to go out for lunch with friends and also my husband, being able to do things on the spur of the moment, everything now has to be planned in advance.  Media & technology Certainly for me technology has been great, I did use it a lot prior to Covid so was well versed in its uses, but the extra time I had meant that I was prepared to try and learn more of what I could do.  As I said Zoom probably was the biggest change for me and something that I think will continue to feature in our lives.  I think that the way that we used our medical services will definitely benefit by more use of technology.  I am more than happy to have an initial consult either by phone or virtually, and in fact had one during June which so impressed me because I got to speak to a consultant within 2 weeks, whereas normally I would have to wait anywhere between 2-3 months if I was lucky! Obviously this would not always be the case, but if the initial consult could be done like this, then it would allow Drs hopefully more time with patients.   I have used online shopping for many years, mainly as I am not keen on grocery shopping at the best of times, and also we only have 1 big supermarket close by which I am not keen on.  Due to the initial problems with getting a delivery slot, I started using another company which is more expensive but had the slots.  Once things settled down a bit, my regular supermarket then had slots and so I now alternate between the 2.  I have been considering going back to my regular deliveries every 2 weeks, but who knows if we will have another lockdown and I don’t want to be prevented from getting my slot. We did invest in a Smart TV in January this year, so this has proved a real bonus as we were then able to sign up to Amazon Prime and Netflix, so we have had many programmes to choose from.  Waiting Yes to a certain extent I do feel my life has been put on hold, and I felt I have missed out on our great granddaughter growing up. She is 21 months now and has changed so much during this spell, and I feel she also has missed out on so much as well.  Fortunately we Facetime our granddaughter so were able to see the little one running around, and in fact our great granddaughter Facetimed me the other day by herself!!!  Obviously as we are getting older, we wanted to do some more travelling particularly as we no longer have a dog.   What has amazed us both is just how the time goes by and it seems it is the weekend again.  At this point I will add that we have not changed our drinking habits during Lockdown, we only drink Friday, Saturday & Sunday in the evenings.  However we do treat ourselves to some bubbly once a fortnight, but apart from that no change.  Even now I rarely go into town, so haven’t had to queue that much.  I think the worst experience I had was early on, when our pharmacy was inundated and people were waiting 5-6 hours just to get their prescription.  I did go down at 6.45 in the morning to queue for my husband’s prescription, he took my place at 8.30, the pharmacy did not open till 9, and got his prescription at 9.30.  At that point we decided to change from this pharmacy and we went online to get ours delivered to the house.  Once this was set up it has been great and we certainly will not be going back to having to pick up a perscription. I am fine with waiting to go into a shop as the weather is nice, but wonder how we will all cope in the winter.  One of the other reasons for not going into town, is that I am not keen on having to wear a mask purely because I wear glasses, and although I have tried a number of different options, my glasses seem to mist up. I prefer to do things online.   Fortunately neither of us have had major problems with health, couple of times we have used the online system and it has worked well for us, but I know that this is not the case for everyone.  In our area we have have very low rates of Covid so we have been lucky.  Other things that have changed  There are a number of things that have changed that I wanted to flag up, although I couldn’t really find a section to put them in but felt they were important to note. Firstly in those weeks of lockdown, we didn’t use our cars, we only went to the allotment so needless to say we still had petrol/diesel in our cars when lockdown was over and of course during lockdown the price of oil slumped!! Cash virtually became extinct, my husband to this day, still has £30 in his wallet that he had on March 23rd nearly 5 months ago because we have gone contactless.  We had been gradually using less cash for quite a while, but now it became the normal way to go. They did up the limit from £30 to £45 which helped.  Mind you it does seem strange to use an app to pay £0.40 for an hour’s car parking!  Previously we would buy a year’s car parking permit but no point as I probably only use the car parks twice a week and sometimes my husband doesn’t use them at all. One of the major downsides of this virus has been our church closed and is still not open.  The church is one of 6 in the team, and due to ours being located in the centre of a busy tourist area, it was felt it would be difficult to open once permission had been given. The need to keep numbers coming in for private prayer down, and the fact that you would need at least 2 people in attendance was going to be hard.  In addition the church had said that anyone over 70 could not do this job and as our congregation are 95% over 70 this was impractical.  So our church was designated as the funeral church, meaning that all funerals over the 6 churches in the team would be held here, and the funeral directors had agreed to clean the areas used after the service.  Fortunately to date we have only had 2 funerals. However we have had an online service each week, and although the team now has a service at one of the churches, as only 35 people can attend, the online service continues.  Its not the same but at least it helps. Prior to the virus, we had all been working hard to cut down on the use of plastics in all forms but particularly plastic bags and we were getting very good at it, of course helped by the fact that you now had to pay for them in shops.  Most people had long life bags which they took with them to the supermarkets etc.  However with online deliveries once again we have gone back to plastic bags which I hate, but apparently this is the only way that supermarkets can safely deliver your shopping.  I am every hopeful that an alternative can be found.   People during this time seemed to have become more caring of others, willing to do more for others whoever they are.  I think the weekly clapping for the NHS was amazing, this was one way that anyone could show that they cared. I trust that we do not loose this. As many people started working from home, and in fact continue to do so, it was reported that a lot of them would stay all day in their pyjamas, or else dress in tee shirts and joggers, occasionally putting on a shirt or blouse if they were having an office Zoom meeting.  I can honestly say that I did not change what I wore any different from what I would normally do and I would put my make up on every day regardless of not going out. I have missed wearing a lot of my clothes as I haven’t gone anywhere to wear them, I wonder how many other women did the same."

I feel increasingly isolated, which makes me feel extremely sad, and I often break down in tears. I have also been placed on furlough leave from my job – originally until June, then July, and now until October – which has taken away my regular routine. This, in turn, increases my anxiety, and I struggle to fill the time each day. Sometimes, I don't even see the point in getting out of bed. I am also filled with dread at the possibility of losing my job completely, especially in a struggling economy. The Government Despite my personal troubles, I do believe the Government were right to implement a lockdown. It helps prevent the virus' spread. However, it annoys me when working-class people are giving hefty fines for going to shops, visiting family, etc. (not that I condone their actions) but a government advisor can drive all the way to Barnard Castle and get off scot free. I also found myself being angry at the Black Lives Matter protests: not because I don't support their message and their fight for equality, but because they broke lockdown rules to gather publicly. I am so fearful of a second spike of the virus and an extended lockdown, I would have much preferred that they kept their protests virtual rather than risking everybody's health. Now that the Government are opening businesses back up, I can only hope they continue to track the cases and R numbers, and that they will close down again if they have to. True, I hate lockdown, and I know a stable and strong economy is important too, but can we really put a price on people's lives? Mass Observation Archive –Spring 2020 Directive - M6884 News I read the news online,usuallythroughTwitter and the BBC News website.As we don't have aTV licence(legally, since we don't watch liveTV), we don't watch the broadcasts: I tendto read thesummaries andkeypoints on theBBCwebsite afterwards.That being said, I tryto limit myexposure tonews, as it makes me nervous and deepens my depression. I do agree that BSLinterpreters should have been onthe UK broadcast from the start, or otherwise, live transcribed subtitles. During a worldcrisis,it is irresponsible to exclude anyone from the latest news andadvice. Work andhome life I have beenfurloughed from myjob, which, as I have mentioned, has been toughon me mentalityas it takes awaymyroutine.

However, our stepdaughter nowstays with us 50% ofthe time and notjust onweekends, so I help with homeschooling.As a hobbyist writer, I especiallyenjoying assisting with her English assignments!Wealso playeducational videogames andwatch documentaries to encouraging learning in a fun wayawayfrom textbooks. TechnologyMyself, myboss andcolleagues haveweeklychats onZoom, just tokeep in touch and help support each other. I also takeYoga classes through Zoom onceaweek to stay active, andregularlyuse ittochat with friends. I also playvideogames with friends over the internet whilst talking with them through aheadset. I am something of a gadget girl, soI havetakento all of this eagerly. Technologyhas been the saviour ofmysocial life, andhas helped keep me sane. I have mainlybeen using social media to look at funnyposts or to follow pages about my hobbies –to have a fundistraction from thesadness fuelled bythe pandemic. I doread the news in brief, but trytolimit myexposure to itto avoid anxietyattacks. I also use itto sharemywritingor photos of things I havecrafted (seeEntertainment and Leisure below). Shopping andfood Whenlockdown was firstdeclared, mypartner andI didn't exactlypanic buy, but we did pick up a fewextra frozenfoods and some tinned goods,just in case. Rice,pasta and bread turnedout to be averywise investment -especiallythe latter, as Ibought an extra loaf to freeze -and soupensured we hadalways had somethingin for lunch. Luckily, we have amilkman,so our milk supplywas ongoing. The onlyshop in our village is aM&S Food storeat the petrol station. To startwith, it was hardto getcertainthings, liketea bags and vegetables, but over time,supplies have returned tonormal. It is more expensivethan the supermarkets, butyou payfor convenience andhigher quality. Nowthat supermarkets have re-opened, we drive tothe Aldi in the next village about once aweek to doa bigger shopto tryand save money. Mypartner and I have beeneating takeaways more often: usuallyas aform ofcomfort Mass ObservationArchive–Spring2020Directive-M6884 eating, and togive us something to look forward to. Doing the weeklybig shops has helped us cut that down, as it ensures we alreadyhave food in the house touseup. Entertainment andLeisure Duringlockdown, I have learned how to loom knit, and enjoymakinghats. Iwillgive some to relatives, anddonate others to charity. Each hat takes a fewhours to knit, so it is a fun activityI can do topass long evenings -usuallywhilst listeningto music andrelaxing in a comfychair. I also write as a hobby, and have entered a fewstories into competitions run byother users of the writingwebsites... winning a few prizes along theway. Writing in itself is another fun activity – allowingme to leave this troubled worldbehind to brieflyescape into a fun fictional one – andthe prizes haveprovidedaconfidenceboost, helping to alleviate mydepression. In addition, Ihave cleared outseveral bags ofoldclothes from cupboards andwardrobes, whichI intend to give to charityshops once lockdownis lifted. Ialso cleared out some old CDs and DVDS, whilst mystepdaughter cleared outallofher old toddler toys. Thesewere placedin cardboard boxes marked “FREE”, which we put out on thepavementoutside of our housefor those in the neighbourhood totake. This was much appreciated,and other houses have since followedsuit. The fewitems thatremain will also be donatedto charity. We,like severalof our neighbours,also took part in theThursdaynight clap for carers, whichwas verymoving – although, in manyways, I also think peopleclapped for themselves: proud of coming together as a nation, proudofkeeping up the strength to cope with everything thathas happened, andis continuing to happen. I certainlyfelt that wayattimes. Mymusic taste is quiteeclectic:I listenfrom everything torock andopera, tomusicals and bubblegum pop. OnTV, comedies like Taskmaster,Blackadder and Bottomhave been fun and sometimes sillydistractions from the pandemic, bringingme some much-needed laughter. I also like watching historical documentaries to learn more aboutvarious famous figures and events, as well as quizzes to keep mybrain busy: mypartner and Ihave fun guessing theanswers together. PersonalHygieneI continueto bathe nightlyduringlockdown:bothto stayclean, and becauseI find bubble baths relaxing. I am washing clothes less oftenas I tendto wear the same clothes for a coupleof days atatime. Theyare notgetting dirtyas I haven't beenleaving the house. Myhair is getting rather longnowas Icannot go for myusual haircut, and I wear it ina low ponytail. Iwash itonce a week, as I have always done, to give myhair achance to produce its natural oils and maintain its strength before cleansingit. I'm not too upset about not being able to visit ahairdresser,as I'm taking this as a opportunitytogrowmy hair longenoughto donate itto the Little Princess Trust,so itcan be madeinto awig for a childgoingthroughchemotherapy.

If I knew someone had no pain, no illness, no disability and no injury, I would probably venture to say that they were 'healthy' but I would never presume to assess their sense of 'wellbeing'. I'm just writing as I think, and now realise that to be 'healthy' one's mind needs to be free of illness or affliction. Someone could easily be physically healthy but if they had psychosis (which could, of course, have a physical basis) you'd never say they were completely healthy! In a broad sense, I'd say that 'health' relates to freedom from illness, injury, pain or disability, while 'wellbeing' refers to a person's sense of satisfaction with their lives and could be affected by all sorts of things other than the condition of that person's body and mind, including financial security, emotional fulfilment, job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, levels of experienced stress, freedom of expression… Five words Five words that come to mind when I think of the term 'healthy body' are: . Strength . Vitality . Muscle . Glowing . Balance One particular person does come to mind when I think of this term, although it's someone I've never met. She is a spiritual teacher who holds online classes my partner attends. I've only ever seen her top half as she's always sitting down, but she almost literally glows, with her long fair hair exuding a radiance and vitality which I'm sure all comes from spiritual fulfilment and strength. Identity I find it quite hard to identify whether my own experiences of 'health' and 'wellbeing' have been influenced by my gender (female), ethnicity (white British), social class (middle-class) or sexual orientation (heterosexual). I've been lucky to have been brought up in what I would identify as a middle-class family. We didn't have a lot of money, but we always had enough, with plenty of good food and medical care when necessary. I've never earnt a lot of money, but I've always had as much as I needed. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Becoming aware about health and wellbeing I really can't remember when I first became aware of 'health' or 'wellbeing'. I remember being given cod liver oil and orange juice when I was a young child (probably up to the age of about five) issued by the NHS and no doubt my mother explained that these were good for my health! I remember as a child of about three sitting on the draining board in the kitchen of our North London home and being given my first junior aspirin to stop a headache or other pain, and I remember having iodine put on grazed knees while at junior school. As far as 'wellbeing' is concerned, I don't think I thought of this as a concept until much later in life. Responsibility for my health and wellbeing My mother was primarily responsible for my health and wellbeing when I was a child, as my father died when I was very young. Talking about health I don't remember having any discussions about health in abstract terms with my mother. We'd certainly have talked about illness, because I had a lot of the childhood illnesses that were common in the 1950s – chickenpox, measles, rubella… and the odd mishap such as a cut forehead (requiring stitches). I think we'd only have talked about health in its absence – when things went wrong. But I do remember taking vitamin tablets (something called 'Haliborange' which combined Vitamin C and halibut liver oil – they tasted wonderfully orangey) so obviously my Mum did take steps to prevent illness and keep us healthy. I don't remember having any health education at primary or secondary school. All I remember is that every so often a visiting doctor would come to the primary school and we all had to line up holding our medical cards (pink for the girls and yellow for the boys, as far as I remember) and be weighed and measured and searched for nits (and probably not much more beyond sticking out our tongues!) There was also a visiting dentist who came to the primary school. Presumably, both of these were provided in an attempt to identify problems in children whose parents didn't look after their health! I certainly didn't learn anything about health from the Internet – it didn't exist when I was at school! – and I don't remember learning anything useful from friends, books, magazines or newspapers. Key moments I vividly remember the day my periods started. Mum had told me about it at least a year before it happened and had bought me a sanitary belt and some pads. In those days, you couldn't buy the small, discreet adhesive pads you get today and pads were much thicker, bulkier and contained at least some fabric and had fabric loops you'd attach to a belt. It was all part of growing up. I've been told about what would happen, and that I wasn't to be alarmed when it did. I was 13 when I 'started'. My paternal grandmother was staying with us as she'd had a fall and broken her hip and been discharged (with very little warning for us) to my mother's care. She was working full time, so I've no idea how she managed with Grandma sleeping in the front room! I went to the toilet, realised I was bleeding and thought 'Oh, Wow! It's happened!' I remember feeling quite excited and running into the front room, where Mum was talking to Grandma and hissing loudly in Mum's ear 'I've started!' The novelty quickly wore off. The embarrassment of doing gym with the fear of the bulky pads showing or of not being able to control the bleeding and the cramps that occasionally sent me to lie on the couch in the domestic science room, clutching a hot water bottle to my abdomen made the monthlies more of a misery than something to be proud of. I don't have any particular memories of my breasts developing or being bought my first bra. I do remember an occasion when I was probably about 15 when my cousin visited us. I'd lost a bit of weight as I'd been feeling unhappy with my shape and his comment that I was looking slimmer and that he'd 'thought you were going to be as big as your mother,' had a very negative effect on me and, I think, pushed me further into anorexia which was just beginning (my mother could never have been described as 'big'!) Growing older Current activity I'd done as much as I can over the years to maintain my physical and mental health. For more than 40 years I've suffered constant back pain which is always there but varies from quite painful to extremely painful. For the same length of time, I've had sleeping problems – waking multiple times every night and often having difficulty getting back to sleep. The back pain has made my life very difficult. I can't sit for longer than 10 minutes a few times a day (enough to eat quick meals and sit for very brief periods at my computer) and I spend most of my time lying down (reading, writing, doing proofreading, talking on the phone, dictating onto my computer, attending online meetings, etc). Maintaining my physical activity has always been important to me. Up until the Covid lockdowns, I was doing two Pilates classes a week at the local leisure centre, rebounding for 15 minutes daily, going to the gym 3-4 times a week and walking for at least 30 minutes a day. I used to swim twice a week but had problems with dry skin and sensitive eyes and haven't been for a few years now. Since lockdown began, I walk for about an hour a day (quite briskly), rebound for 15 minutes and do 20 minutes of Pilates exercises (twice a week I join an online Pilates class instead of doing my own exercises). Getting information on health and wellbeing Most of my information comes from the Internet. I've recently been researching the link between Oxaliplatin (a chemotherapy drug with which I was treated for advanced colon cancer in 2008) and hepatic portal tension/bleeding oesophageal varices (which I have but which don't seem to be caused by cirrhosis of the liver – the most usual cause). I no longer have full access to medical journals (as I once did while working) but you can get a lot free online! I get information on Covid-19 (e.g. latest statistics, information on vaccines), from the Internet, newspapers and radio. Body awareness I would say that in some ways, I'm more aware of my body now than I was, say, in my 20s, but in some ways less aware. As a young woman, I was always rather self-conscious and felt awkward in my body but I wasn't in pain and didn't experience my body as a source of discomfort. Having had severe back pain for over 40 years, I've got used to being in pain all the time and to me it is 'normal'. I don't feel as awkward and unattractive as I did when I was young, but I am very aware of my body all the time because the pain is always there and restricts my activity to a large extent. How will my approach to health and wellbeing change in future years? I can't imagine my approach to health and wellbeing changing in the future. Eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, trying to avoid unnecessary stress, meditating, and keeping away from pollution – all these things will continue to be of great importance to me. Health, wellbeing and appearance How are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? It is possible to tell quite a lot about a person's state of health (both physical and mental) from how they look, how they dress, how they walk etc. Psychological tension shows in the face and posture, tiredness, etc can also be quite visible. Wellbeing is, I suppose, more difficult to assess (more subjective) but depression, agitation, anger, frustration etc (all of which would contribute to how a person 'is' in the world) can often be detected from a person's external appearance. Appearances can be deceptive, of course. A man we know who committed suicide recently gave an outward appearance of being healthy, happy with his life and generally at ease. Being influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance I think we must all be influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance! These ideals are embedded in so much that we read, see on television and at the cinema, on the radio, look at on social media… It can be very subtle and unstated but the ideals are there and usually they're extremely difficult to meet. The fashion, cosmetic, fitness and beauty industries rely heavily on persuading us of how we should look and suggest that unless we conform, we won't be accepted by our fellows. I do try not to be influenced by these ideals and I'm pleased to say I've never been a slave to fashion and hardly ever wear make up. I do have a morbid fear of being fat but (fortunately, for a recovered anorexic!) I'm also aware of the dangers of being too thin and try to maintain a 'healthy' weight. Were my parents influenced by these ideals? I don't think they were. My father died when I was very young so I can't speak for him, but my mother has never been very fashion-conscious (she has good taste but certainly isn't a slave to fashion) and as far as I can remember has never dieted or embarked on any particular exercise regime. Health and beauty products I couldn't do without . Dental floss and interdental brushes (I have gum disease and quite large gaps between my teeth) . Moisturising lotion (different ones for face and body): my skin is very dry and I couldn't cope without at least moisturiser on my face . Back massager (it helps to relieve my pain) . Mini-trampoline: I rebound for 15 minutes every day and would really miss it if I couldn't do it. Useful low-impact exercise that protects my back but gets me moving! My desert island item would be moisturiser for my face (preferably with sun protection). Getting ready to leave the house Parents I can't give any information on my father (see above). My mother always used to use curlers in her hair (at one time heated ones) – either overnight or in the morning – and put on some make up (foundation, powder, lipstick and I'm not sure what else) before leaving for work or socialising. She still (at 95) uses a bit of make up but is now using curling tongs or something for her hair. Not that she's going out much at the moment, with the Covid restrictions getting stricter by the minute! My own 'routine' I wouldn't say I have – or ever had – much of a 'routine' when getting ready to go out to work or socialising. I've been retired for some years now but there's no difference between how I prepare to go out now and how I used to prepare when I was younger. I used to use a bit of make up for some social events (dating, going to a party) but never very much and never when going to work. The most I really do is to brush my hair – I can't go out with my hair looking a mess!"

Slim . A glow . Functional . Mindful . Exercise Think of a person who is healthy – I suppose that would be Joe Wicks. My God, that man is irritating. There are a lot of men who like to post gym selfies on social media showing their “gains”. I don’t see them as healthy. If your need for validation is great enough to need to post gym selfies, your mental health requires attention. The picture of health has been made toxic by neoliberalist ideals. Competition is not the answer – public health collaboration is. Identity In public health terms, health and wellbeing is massively influenced by your socioeconomic means and the populations you belong to, depending on your intersectionality. In my case, I live in a rural middle-class area and I’m keen on the gym. I have easy access to healthcare, and I think this counts for a lot. I am keenly aware of health as that is my professional background. I’m more aware of my health now I’m in my 40s – I’ve started to creak a little and make “the Dad noise” when I get out of chairs. I’m also no longer flexible enough to bite my own toenails. This is both a good and bad thing. However, when I was growing up, men in their 40s looked a lot older than they do now. This is in part down to better living conditions for those who can afford it, and better nutrition (for those who don’t need food banks). With the collapse of population growth in the UK, the widening gap between rich and poor, the increase in food and fuel poverty and the approach of Brexit (God help us), I suspect the standard of living has peaked and will soon decline. Thank you very much, Tory voters. Mental health and physical health are closely entwined, but I know there is still a lot of prejudice out there about poor mental health. I have worked in pubs and have heard myself the phrase, “they should just man up” used for people with depression and the like. I myself have a mental health disorder – obsessive compulsive disorder. It has only relatively recently been diagnosed, but an off shoot of it when younger was an eating disorder, which severely damaged both physical and mental health. Now, post therapy which taught me to manage OCD, I am the most mentally healthy I’ve ever been. If it wasn’t for lockdown closing all the gyms, I’d still be the most physically healthy I’ve ever been too. I fully intend to age as healthily as I can. Growing up… Mum was the main person keeping us healthy growing up. She got us used to eating vegetables from a very young age and I can’t remember ever disliking them. It was always focused more on diet and playing outside than targeted exercise and neither me nor my sibling have ever been overweight (before lockdown for me). There were sweets around growing up, but I can’t remember ever desperately wanting them. They were a treat to be had occasionally. Key Moments… As stated above, I had an eating disorder in my teen years. However, this was to do with undiagnosed OCD at a time when mental health wasn’t as understood as it is now. I was greatly aware of the pressure to look good and of the other teenagers in class who were developing much faster than I was. The only men in the media were buff and muscled and I thought everyone had to look like that. At the time (before a very quick growth spurt), I was small and weedy with puppy fat. I learned what grown ups looked like naked through the VHS tapes of porn that were handed pupil to pupil round the school (showing my age there!). That alerted me to where pubic hair grew and that there were different body shapes. I worry for the young now because I think that “body ideal” has taken over and they can access anything online. That body ideal was just coming in when I was a teenager and I mentally latched onto that instead. It was around the time Marky Mark did his training video and footballers started doing naked shoots. Actually, it was seeing a topless photo of Ryan Giggs in The Sunday Times that made me realise I was gay. Shaving wasanordeal.I used to slice my face apartoncheaprazors.I can’t remember anyone ever showing me how to do it. I think I locked myself away and experimented until I got it right. Nowadays, I have a big bushy beard. Much easier. There was some information about puberty around in the early 1990s, but not a great deal. It certainly wasn’t as sophisticated, and as evidence based as it is now. Remember, there was no internet, either. Before my growth spurt, I was small and weedy compared with my peers. During my growth spurt, I had excruciating growing pains in my knees and legs. My knees are still bad. Afterwards, I was self-consciously tall and gangly and awkward. You just had to figure it all out for yourself amid a climate of piss-taking, peer pressure and misinformation. My abiding memory of this is the stench of Lynx Africa deodorant. It was the brand boys wore and that was that. The gay ideal… Being gay brings all kinds of pressures. There is very much the body beautiful ideal at work, coupled with a very ageist notion that you’re on the scrapheap once you’re past 30 years old. It’s rubbish, of course, but for a long time, I believed it. The gay press and social media is full of mostly white young men with big pectorals and six pack stomachs. They are not real people. People who look like this are often very boring to talk to and are lazy in bed. Going to a gym is not a personality. It’s the same with the unrealistic notion of penis size. Porn tells gay men that they need a big penis, and if theirs isn’t the size of a small tree, they are somehow deficient. Again,it’s utter balderdash. It promotes an unhealthy arena of hyper-masculinity. Quite often, those people who believe it is everything areveryboring indeed becausethey’ve never had to try to be interesting and to cultivate a personality. The effect this so-called ideal on the gay psyche is devastating. The average joe is made to feel inadequate and somehow lacking, hence a high prevalence of eating disorders, depression and anxiety. It creates a hierarchy of masculinity and feminisation in a deeply misogynistic order. It is also very ageist, rendering anyone over 30 or so invisible. Give me an older man who can make me laugh and hold a good conversation any day of the week. That’s much healthier in my opinion. Growing Older As stated above, I am very aware of healthy ageing. In fact, I study that very subject at a high level. Personally, lockdowns permitting, I go to the gym regularly and do plenty of cardiovascular work, play memory games, and keep my brain very active. My careeris leading me more towards a sedentary life, so I’mtrying to counterbalance this with exercise. During lockdowns, I’ve taken to walking through the fields instead. Anything to keep going. Despite the sciatica and arthritis in my toes, and my bad knees and propensity to put weight on more easily, I’mactually thefittest mentally andphysically I everhave been. Speaking as someone who used to smoke like a chimney and drink like a fish through his twenties, I’m not so much in bad shape. Indeed, I know people my age who are a lot worse than I am. I am also well aware of the health benefits of socialising. For years, I was lonely. It is hard for older single gay men to meet anyone. Ironically, the pandemic has improved my social life because everyone has been forced to socialise differently via Zoom calls. Now I have the best regular social life I’ve had since my twenties. More to the point, I now have a best friend and we talk every single day. I am no longer lonely. I do worry about a time when my family are no longer around – when my parents have gone and the rest of them are still abroad. I just hope my family of choice (Weston, 1997) will still be there because I’m going to need them. I think my parent’s generation had very different ideas about health, namely not too many cigars and not drinking too much before driving. I have a vague memory of a man saying no to his eighth pint before driving in a television drama… and he got home OK. Nowadays, that would be a set-up for an accident. Their ideal of health (in the 70s and 80s) what a lot less precise than it was now. Certainly, jogging and gyms were a niche thing. I remember my Mum had a Jane Fonda yoga LP that was never played. Getting ready to leave the house… My Dad always used to wear a suit and my Mum and Aunties always used to wear tonnes of make up in the 1980s when going out. The most casual men ever got was wearing a sports jumper over their shirt. Women had handbags, men had wallets. If it was a very fancy do, the women would wear fur coats. When I leave the house, it’s very different. I have OCD and before therapy, I would load everything into a rucksack, unpack it, check it, pack it again, unpack… repeat ad nauseum. I always looked like I was going on a hike. I love my ratty old rucksack. I suppose things are more casual now. Now I’ve had therapy, I forget all sorts. I like wearing my grey trackie bottoms in the house because they’re comfy, but I never wear them outside because I don’t want to look like a total chav. Instead, I wear jeans, t shirt and hoodie. Smart casual. At a push, I’ll wear a shirt if I have to. Since the advent of the Coronavirus, of course, one is never without a mask. Being me, I have several stuffed into pockets along with hand sanitiser and tissues. I always have my wallet, mobile phone, keys, and mask. Almost always loose change too just in case and a water bottle. You’d think I’m trekking across the Andes, but I’m really only going to Tesco."

I obviously try to eat sensibly and have done a small amount of exercise over the years. Since my 40’s I have attended an assortment of keep fit classes. Aerobics, dancing to movement, ballet, tap dancing, I have tried yoga but didn’t enjoy it and have not been to a Pilates class. I must admit I haven’t been to a class for the last 10 years. I have never been obsessed with these classes and have never joined a gym. I went to these classes mainly as a social activity, with the side line that it may be doing me good. My parents were not concerned with health. One just got on with living and if one got measles ( which I think was the only childhood illness I had ) then you just stayed at home until one got better. I remember my sister having a bad case of whooping cough, but certainly although unpleasant, not a big deal. Wellbeing was certainly a word never mentioned in my childhood and one that I would rarely say even now. It is a word that I would find difficult to define. I find the idea that someone had the responsibility for looking after my health and well being quite farcical. My parents were responsible for bringing me up and making sure I was well fed and cared for . Thats what parents did . There was never a thermometer in the house, and I also have never had a thermometer in my house. I don’t remember any particular conversations about health. When I was a teenager and had started my periods, my mother took me to the cinema to see a film about having a baby. I suppose there was some discussion about it. I went to a girls only school and I believe we had some biology lesson about reproduction, but periods and when one had “started” was discussed between my friends. I was aware fairly early in my teens that I had bigger breasts than most of my contemporaries, which made me feel a bit self conscious. They have stayed bigger than most and I would prefer them to have been slightly W1677 smaller. Obviously my experience of health during my life has been influenced by my gender. I am a woman so I have had periods,pregnancy, children, then the menopause. All these activities has had side effects on ones body, and health, and although at times inconvenient and unpleasant, it has obviously made you aware of your body from time to time. Am I more aware of my body now. Yes I am getting old and am permanently told by society, that I am an old, vulnerable person. I do not have the stamina that I used to. Fortunately I am still healthy. Sleep well, well actually too much,. Enjoy food and still have a healthy appetite. Have the odd niggle but nothing to get concerned about. Unfortunately one is almost expecting something to happen because of my age.I rarely visit the doctor. I don’t take vitamin tablets, don’t follow a strict regime of activity or anything. Covid has made me less active which is a bind, but it hasn’t Affected me mentally. I find I am able to relax and as they say these days “chill out” mind you I am lucky that I have a husband who is also healthy, so can chivvy each other at times. What beauty product would I take to a desert island, a pair of tweezers because facial hair seems to be more of a problem now I get older, and a lipstick. I could live without this but would be nice. When my parents when out of the house they were always dressed well. Collar and tie for my father, often a real rose or flower in his lapel. My mother would always wear high heeled shoes, matching handbag, probably a hat. My routine is not that different. Until the past 10 years I would also have worn heels, now they are flatter as I am beginning to worry about slipping on wet leaves or shiny tiled shopping malls, I always wear make up, and try to look smartish. I think my parents casual approach to health or lack of worrying about it has had a large effect on me. Hopefully that approach which I also carried out with my children has had the same effect on them. I think it has, as health and doctors are not subjects that feature largely in their life. Mind you we have been lucky and have all been fairly healthy."

The healthy body that I have in mind is the athlete who trains and controls his/her body to the maximum degree. This is unattainable for the average person yet is an example of what can be achieved by willpower. GROWING UP AND LEARNING ABOUT HEALTH AND WELLBEING As a child I was brought up by my grandparents (born 1889 and 1893) – in particular by my grandmother who knew little or nothing about the structure and workings of the human body. I was first made aware of “health/wellbeing” when I was quite young. Towards the end of the war children like me were given added vitamins. A local “food office” attended by the WVS distributed orange juice and cod liver oil to parents to add to their children’s diet and I remember being told why this was necessary and why I also had to take additional “iron” medicine due to my having anaemia; it was horrible stuff! At my village school just after the war we were given an exciting project which, for a time became a craze. It was explained to us that there was a national shortage of vitamin C and this was to be found in rose-hip syrup. We were asked to collect rose-hips and bring them into school. To encourage this we received “promotions” depending on the weight of rose-hips collected. A small quantity would merit a “Private” badge; the bigger the bagful the higher the promotion, rising from “Corporal” and “Sergeant” to “Lieutenant” and up to “General”.  All other playground games paused as we searched the district for rose-hips and promotion. Eventually the school had to stop the scheme as the place was overwhelmed with sacks full of rose-hips. Also at our village school we did P.T. (physical training) twice a week in the playground (or in school if the weather was bad). We also had BBC Schools programmes which sometimes explained the importance of good health. We had regular visits from the “nit-nurse” who lined us up and examined our hands and heads. It was shaming for those whom she picked out of the line to stand apart for they were now “nitties”. At grammar school we had regular PT every week as well as games sessions. Our PT master explained the importance of keeping fit. Each term we were checked for weight and height and this was recorded on our reports. A dentist came to the school once a year. That was the only time I visited a dentist – which meant that up to the age of 11 I had never seen a dentist at all. KEY MOMENTS I recall vividly the time when I was 13 and became aware of changes in my body. I was utterly terrified and added to this I was acutely self-conscious due to being overweight. I had always played with girls as well as boys but now I found that I liked one or two girls in a different way which I found hard to explain to myself; I experienced “crushes” for numerous girls. Being a fat boy I kept such feelings to myself, fearing ridicule and humiliation yet my body was doing things I could not control. Hair was growing where it had never been and I had uncontrollable genital urges for which I was ashamed and scared. I was getting a hairy face and sometimes was leg pulled about using a razor – which I dreaded. I had never had the facts of life explained to me other than in the playground which made the whole thing even more frightening. I had no one to advise me or calm my worries. My grandmother was a kind and loving person to whom I went for assurance and advice in most things but I felt unable to ask her help with my current problem. I was aware of her dislike of anything to do with relations between the sexes. Even on-screen kissing in the cinema made her squirm. I wonder today just how she ever became a mother herself. The idea of applying to my grandfather for his advice was out of the question. I felt that a major breakthrough came when I was 17. I had lost a lot of weight and was fitter and more self confident. I was popular with my friends and I had my first girl friend. The first time I kissed her was a breakthrough which somehow freed me from past anxieties. It was a very short-lived relationship but a turning point for me. Having sex outside marriage was unthinkable at that time but I do remember an overwhelming urge to do so. GROWING OLDER From an early age I knew that health and wellbeing were important. Between the ages 9-16 I had been overweight and was well aware of it. I had played active sport and by 17 the weight dropped and I felt much better for that. I played cricket in the summer but nothing in the winter until I began playing rugby. I didn’t like the game much but as I was no good at my favourite sport football I chose rugby just to keep fit. Since those days I’ve always had fitness in mind without going about it like others – going to gyms, jogging etc. Now I’m in my 80’s I feel fitter than I have done for years – the Coronavirus lockdown has helped in that I (and my wife) have walked more than at any time in years. We have always enjoyed walks but now see the need to exercise more and more as we get older. The turning point in my health awareness was when I saw my doctor on a minor matter when I was 23. After I was married I began to put on weight again. At that time I was over 17 stone. The doctor put me on a diet which I stuck to for months and the weight fell off me. I lost about 4 stones in 3 months and never regained it as my life-style changed. I became constantly aware of my health,diet and weight and felt much better. Diet is very important to me. I’ve never liked junk food and don’t eat red meat because I just don’t like it rather than for vegetarian reasons. We eat a lot of fruit and vegetables and many meals are meat free because we like it that way. I cut down on my alcohol intake over a year ago. I don’t know what my alcohol units were but I decided that they needed reducing to weekend drinking only. Out went the daily gin and tonic.  I smoked from around 16 years until I stopped at 25 and never did so again. I keep aware of health matters in the press and on radio. There are many fads and theories which need careful sifting but generally I look for health reports and advice where there are words like “will” and “do” rather than “might” and “probably”. I don’t have many more years to go so health and wellbeing are essentials for me and my wife. We make sure we exercise regularly and take care in things we do – avoid risks like climbing ladders or doing strenuous things that we once found easy. We know all too well that although we are very fit now, life can change in an instant due to an unexpected accident. Without being ultra cautious we are aware of dangers but enjoy life none the less. It’s best not to contemplate the future too much but try not to become another problem for family and the NHS. HEALTH, WELLBEING AND APPEARANCE I’ve never been influenced by ideals of beauty or appearance and I’m certain that my grandparents’ never were either. Both my grandmother and mother followed fashion trends as most women always did but they didn’t necessarily follow slavishly what some icon wore – at the time it was the Duchess of Kent and the models in Vogue magazine. For men things were very different and I seem to have followed on from that. So I don’t have “grooming” items in my bathroom cupboard, just a toothbrush, deodorant and a razor. I always assumed that only horses and dogs were “groomed”. The idea of scent for men is laughable. If a man smells bad, bathe more and use a deodorant. Men seem to be going back to the days of the cavaliers and macaronis. I suppose it’s meant to signify that he’s on heat. If I was on my Desert Island I would need my toothbrush. GETTING READY TO LEAVE THE HOUSE I don’t ever remember seeing my grandparents going out together. When they did go out there was little ceremony about it. Grandfather just put on his hat and coat and went. Grandmother took a little more time about it. She was clothes conscious and had a couple of local dressmakers to whom she went for up-to-date styles. I remember the fuss she made with my aunt when something called the “New Look” happened in about 1947. Hats were important too, some of which looked like cakes. She also wore a fur thing draped across her shoulders which looked like a dead skunk. This thing fascinated me as it was some unknown fox-like animal with the head still on with a clip under its chin. I saw similar things worn by her friends which today would be greeted with horror, but that was around 1949 and very much “in” for ladies of a certain age. I’m now retired and do not attend any large social events other than occasional friends’ gatherings which are for the most part informal. I last wore a dinner jacket over 20 years ago and remember how much I loathed being a stuffed penguin for an evening.  When I was a magistrate I was expected to dress in a suitable way – a jacket and tie, which was perfectly acceptable. Since I retired from the bench I have hardly worn a tie since. A jacket, comfortable trousers, a shirt and a sweater will do. November 2020"

We have managed to stay fit and healthy (both physically and mentally) throughout the entire lockdown period. Emotionally we have been as usual, really. We have had occasional frustrations which have sparked small flares of tempers and bouts of grumbling but other than that we are getting on with our new lives and are remaining happy as we do so. I realise that this probably puts us in a very small minority, and we realise how lucky we are that we can carry on without any mental or physical impact. The Government I think that given that we are living in unprecedented times the Government is doing the best they can with the information that they are given - which is an ever changing outlook! Obviously they have made mistakes and can be guilty of not being as clear as they could be, but sometimes I think that the media and certainly the public can be just as obtuse when interpreting what has been said, meaning that much confusion reigns when it isn’t absolutely necessary. One thing I would have liked the Government to report on daily is the recovery rate in the UK, as this would be a positive light in the current darkness. Every other country is managing to do this, so why can’t we? Having listened to Boris speak yesterday (10th May) and whilst waiting for the 50 page document which will (hopefully) clarify what is coming over the next few months, I believe that they will try to stick to the “roadmap” as best as they can allowing for changes in the 5 criteria. Hopefully, they will be watching what is happening in Europe as they come out of their own lockdowns a few weeks ahead of us, and will use their data to help move us forward. News To be frank, I am not listening to most of the news that is out there as unfortunately there are so many conflicting reports it is hard to know what to believe. I look up the points that are relevant to me and what I need to know at the time (the infection rate and death rate for instance) and what will help me keep my business moving forward. As I am a key worker I have continued to go to the office to work so I am travelling home when the 5pm briefing is on TV. So I cannot really comment on whether they are useful or not! Work and Home Life As previously mentioned, I am still working. My work pattern has not changed, however the size of my team in the office has diminished as we have a number of office staff who can work from home during this lockdown. I am a Director for a Medical Devices company (we manufacture and supply laryngectomy and tracheostomy tubes and accessories) and our products are in great demand from the NHS at the moment so we are working flat out to maintain a good supply to them. This is good for our company, it means that it will continue to be strong during the pandemic, allowing us to keep all of our staff fully employed with no threat of the company failing or job losses. Prior to the pandemic my husband and I spent most of our time together at home quite happily. We don’t frequent pubs, clubs, restaurants or other such places. So we are carrying on pretty much in the same vein as before, with the notable exceptions that we are missing our families and our rugby league! Again, I am fully aware that by not having children, by continuing to work and by not having had to make massive changes to our home lives we are very lucky and in a minority of people who are not finding many challenges during this time. Technology I have always been a techy person so using technology to keep in touch isn’t something new to me. But I have found that I have been teaching a lot of people how to access and use technology so that they can benefit during lockdown. This has been both at home and work. At work we have taken to having Zoom meetings instead of face to face and the Teams app has been invaluable in keeping teams talking to each other. We have also been doing more WhatsApp video chatting too. They are all very useful tools, but nothing replaces face to face conversation. At home WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have been the most used apps for us. However, I did do a WhatsApp video call with my Mum to teach her how to download books on Kindle - that was a fun 30 minutes! :) Shopping and Food The main thing that we will take away from this lockdown is that we now love to shop at Aldi. Until this happened we rarely went in Aldi, but at the start of the lockdown they were the best stocked and most civilised place to shop in. We will not stop using them after all this is over. We have not gone without anything that we need as far as food and drink is concerned. We eat simply and have found that the things we buy on a weekly basis have been in good supply at all times. The biggest change to the shopping experience is having to queue outside the shop/supermarket so that they can have a minimal amount of customers in at any one time. I do not have an issue with this and wouldn’t mind if it carried on for some time. There is something to be said about being only one of 8 people in the supermarket and being able to get to the shelves to buy what you want without having to move a gaggle of chatting people out of the way first. Queue inside, queue outside - where’s the difference, it takes no longer and it is much safer this way. Okay, it might not be so much fun when the weather isn’t so nice, but even still… Entertainment and Leisure During lockdown we have continued to entertain ourselves the same way as we did prior. We spend our evenings chilling playing games on our tablets, reading, watching classic comedies on the TV and listening to music whilst just enjoying being in each other’s company. On a weekend, now that we have no other commitments we take long walks. We are lucky that we have some great nature walks close to us so it is easy to take a good 5-6 mile round walk without leaving our postcode. The only new entertainment is that we are trying to grow our own veg, this is a new project for us and so far so good. The carrots and lettuce look like they are ready to be planted outside any time soon! Personal Hygiene We have not changed any personal hygiene habits in the past 8 weeks or so. My husband has OCD and we have always observed good hand-washing routines and wiping supermarket foods down before putting them away, so the current government directives about hygiene change nothing for us. The only difference this lockdown has made to us is that I have had to cut my own hair (it’s pixie short and if allowed to grow will get thick and curly) - I’m actually getting quite good at it too. Sleep I have to be honest, because our routines have changed very little and because we are getting a good amount of exercise and fresh air out sleeping patterns have remained pretty much the same. We have suffered with neither insomnia or nightmares."

Wellbeing for me is a state of mind and body, which is the best it can be, and is a pervasive feeling that all is well with my inner world. A healthy body is one which in general lets you get on with living your life, without having to worry overmuch about how it’s coping, or whether you’re going to be in pain. Words which come to mind are: functioning organs and physical parts of the body; weight-control; medicine-free; being pain-free. No one person embodies this for me, though I suppose a person who walks, cycles or exercises regularly is the usual norm for many people. Identity My health and wellbeing have been greatly influenced by my gender in particular, because of several operations and other gynaecological health interventions, from the age of 20 onwards. I’m not sure if it was connected, but around the age of 60, I had uterine cancer. I’ve also experienced other difficulties like cataracts in both eyes, a severe back problem, now fine after a very tricky operation, a new hip and arthritis. However, I think these have all contributed to making me a more positive and optimistic person. Each ‘cure’ or improvement shows me how lucky I’ve been to have overcome these difficulties, particularly the cancer diagnosis. Twelve years ago, this felt like a death knell. Many people who’ve had this experience, feel that each new day is a blessing. I certainly do myself. So hopefully these experiences have also made me a stronger person. K7595 Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My earliest memory about health, as a small child, is of being warned strongly, not to play anywhere near drains, in case I got polio. This was long before vaccination came on the general scene, When I was growing up in the fifties, it was common practice (for our social working -class group anyway) to put your child to play with other infected children, so I had measles, mumps and chicken pox, and anything else going-no vaccines then. This is the ‘herd immunity’ idea I believe. We didn’t question it. In fact, I actually quite relished being ill, to a certain extent, as I got my mother’s attention, I could spend the day in bed reading her childhood books and a neighbour gave me a lot of copies of ‘Sunny Stories’ booklets. My auntie even gave me a small model of the Queen’s Coronation coach to trundle along the bedclothes. It was 1953 and I was nearly 6 years old. However, in 1957-8 the country was gripped by Asian Flu, a pandemic, which impinged on my life personally, in that I was too ill to take the 11+ exam. Fortunately for me, there were so many children with Asian Flu up and down the country, the authorities had to hold a second wave of exams later in the year. I say fortunately-if fewer ten-year olds had succumbed to ‘flu, I might not have had the opportunity to pass my 11+ and my life would have taken a totally different direction. Secondary Modern schoolchildren were often sadly not given the opportunities we received at Grammar School. I’ve got no recollection of particularly learning about health at school. We took Biology as an academic subject, but health and wellbeing were not really taken into consideration then. We just had to get on with it! Key Moments My mother tried to tell me the Facts of Life when I was around 9 years old, but I didn’t believe her for a minute. She came into the bathroom while I was in the bath. I remember being interested in the new hair growing on my pubis. I was also in denial about the growth of my breasts and refused to consider the notion of wearing a bra, even though I knew some of my classmates revelled in the thought of approaching womanhood. Even on the day my first period started in August 1959, I told my mother it must have been a scratch-I remember being in a state of confusion. Wisely, she didn’t argue, just initiated me into a new world, by giving me massive sanitary towels, to be held up by a belt contraption that looked like a torture pulley. Growing Older I think I muddled through life health-wise until I was 24 when I had a serious emergency operation, which developed into septicaemia, now called sepsis – I was very ill and nearly K7595 died. So I really had to take stock. I also married shortly after, which meant I had two bodies to care for. Growing Older… This was when I began to appreciate the importance of what you put in, and on, your body. We became vegetarian, and I visited the Body Shop, run by Anita Roddick , a business newly opened in Brighton. Thus began my life-long ‘obsession’ of eating and using organic products where I could afford it. Brighton’s Infinity Foods was the only beacon of all things organic but I’m glad to say health and wellbeing have become more the norm, with all supermarkets providing healthy food at a competitive price. I think we must have been in the vanguard, in the 1970s, even though we were regarded as hippy and alternative. I’ve never abandoned those beliefs. Although now in my seventies, I’m very much still aware of my bodily and mental health. In fact, increasingly so, as it becomes more important with age. I try to eat healthily (but with added chocolate), I now never drink or smoke, (though I did in my youth), and I take supplements. Health, wellbeing and appearance It seems logical that appearance should be linked to health and wellbeing. A healthy weight for our frame, we’re told, is important, and so is a healthy skin wrapped round a skeleton, joints and organs which are in good working order through as much exercise as possible. This isn’t easy, with age-related challenges like arthritis, for example, or mental decline, but perhaps people have to take responsibility for themselves if they possibly can. Maybe do the exercise, give up excessive drinking and smoking and eat less! Perhaps our generations have it easier than my parents’, who lived through the privations of war. Money was tight for my mother when we were children, too, so she only wore a dab of face powder, and a slick of lipstick. Occasionally, even after all these years, I have to shake off the feeling that some of my beauty items are superfluous, and probably indulgent. (Her ‘treat’ wasn’t a new lipstick or tin of Nivea cream. When she could afford it, her choice was a quarter of sherbet lemons!) In my memory store, there was never time, money or inclination to care much about the connection of wellbeing with appearance. Desert Island Item? My go-to health supplement is B12 as I believe it helps my memory to function well, but maybe on a desert island, this would matter less! Therefore, my must-have beauty product would definitely be an unlimited supply of face and body moisturiser. Organic of course! Getting Ready to Leave the House K7595 Neither of my parents spent a huge amount of time getting ready to go out. They had to get us children sorted out, but in any case, they didn’t have much choice in what to wear. A wash and change after lunch WAS important for my mother, though, staying in or going out. This washed away the debris from morning’s housework tasks. To my amusement, I do the same very often, when I stay in. When I go out, I always wear makeup, mascara being the most important, then lipstick. Older faces often look wan, so maybe a hint of blusher may be added. The ritual of shower, dressing, hair and often makeup has never changed from when I got up at 6.00 for work, or for socialising, or now, retirement in the Covid 19 world. Looking as well as I can on the outside, helps me feel good on the inside."

Well­being I think is more about peace of mind and your mental health. A healthy body? Well-fed Toned Muscles Shiny Happy The kind of person who comes to mind is slim, toned, good skin and hair. Not necessarily that young, but certainly in good health for their age. Identity I don’t know that my experience of well being and health is influenced by anything except. My parents seemed reasonably healthy, but both smoked and never exercised. Both worked full time and we ate pretty well with not much fried food and hardly any processed food. I think there is more emphasis on good health now, especially mental health and well-being. I grew up in a family where we were “healthy” unless we were ill. We didn’t discuss symptoms or feelings. You were either poorly or well. There was no in between! I don’t think this was a gender specific way of looking at things, but perhaps it was class based? Before social security and sick pay, if you were ill, you didn’t earn. I broke my radius and ulna late morning on holiday aged 12 and knew enough to not make a fuss until it really wasn’t feeling any better. I was brought up to not make a fuss, so reluctantly I told my mum it still was hurting. This sounds barbaric now, but kids were seen and not heard to some extent and I was a well behaved kid! Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I became aware of health and well-being when I was told (sort of) that my mum had suffered a breakdown of a sort in the late 1970s. She was supporting all 5 of us on a tiny wage as my dad had been made redundant. I don’t remember thinking anything dreadful about it at the time -that stoical childhood again -but now I’m horrified. My parents were responsible for looking after my health and wellbeing when I were younger, although schools were also involved. We had the “nit nurse” who checked our hair, feet and eyesight. A dentist in primary school and milk until the Tories took it away. I don’t remember anyone talking to me about health? As I say, you were either well or not, and most people seemed to be in good health. We also didn’t receive any health education at school (other than sex education) but that didn’t cover STDs etc. Key moments I was a late starter and didn’t start my periods until I was 14. My nana told me she had started menstruating at 11, so I felt like a freak and avoided all conversations about it. I was very flat chested too, so felt very girlish. I always say my boobs arrived the day after I left school!! I remember my husband telling me that he’d started to shave at a really young age. Probably 14 or so. Your first period or bra, is so important for girls. Or at least was when I was a girl. Shaving my legs and underarms came much later, but I remember buying roll on deodorant for myself etc. In later life, my Mum and I could discuss anything, but she didn’t talk to me about puberty at all when I was heading that way. I was so glad to become “a woman” and still didn’t discuss it with contemporaries, but felt ready to, if the moment arrived! Growing older I started smoking at 19. My husband didn’t smoke and although I smoked when we met, he hated it and I agreed to stop once I reached 40, which I did. Ironically, I didn’t feel that different as I think I must have an addictive personality as I stopped smoking and started eating! The money I saved also didn’t really make that much of a difference. Following the death of my husband, I decided to start looking at my lifestyle. I was chubby. I remember thinking I was fat when I was younger, but looking back at photos, I realse I was fine. Stopping smoking made me eat. My niece is a dietitian and has helped me loose a substantial amount of weight and that has made me feel better. Physically and mentally. As the only girl with two brothers, I grew up in a sporty family, and played out. That stopped once I left high school. My niece helps me and imparts information about health and wellbeing and I am certainly more aware of my body now? I know what to eat and what to do to maintain a healthy body. I hope that in future years, my health and wellbeing will improve if anything. Health, wellbeing and appearance I hated looking at photographs of myself, So I know that health and wellbeing are directly related to external appearance. I don’t mind looking at myself again in photos. I’m not as pretty as I once was, but I’m slimmer. I’m not influenced by fashion or popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance as it changes all the time. I hope that the attitudes to what women are meant to look like has changed. We are not models. We have flaws and we are real, not airbrushed dolls. My parents grew up when the idea of the kinds of ideals was a tan, coiffured hair and good smart clothes. I don’t think I could live without shampoo and conditioner. I hate having grubby hair, but Desert Island item would probably be either foundation or eye makeup. Getting ready to leave the house My mum always wore heels for work and smart dresses or skirts and blouses. My dad wore trousers and a shirt and tie. When they went out, they wore the same! Their dressed down gear, was older, tattier versions of the same. I don’t remember them taking ages to get ready to go out like I do now! When I go out now, I take less time than I used to. I used to think that I needed 2 hours, but now it’s half that. I’m probably quicker at applying makeup, but I also think I’m less bothered as I get older. Getting ready for work takes about the same as ever, but I’m less rushed in my approach, so it actually probably takes less time."

I don’t go out a lot other than for work, and I can be quite antisocial in some ways. My husband has been furloughed since the end of March and has enjoyed his time off -especially as he disliked his job and was looking to reduce his hours anyway. I think if one or other of us were more sociable, it would have been difficult as we were very isolated with no family nearby. I am still working through lockdown from home with one trip a week into the library, and I find that keeps me focused and content. The Government I think the furlough scheme has been a godsend to many companies -including where I work. Of our staff all but 4 are furloughed. I think some of the instructions about what constitutes an essential journey, going out and mask wearing for example have been somewhat confusing and for those people without access to the internet or a television, must have found it difficult to know what to do for the best. The government must be concerned about the amount of money it is laying out for furlough and the consequences of companies going out of business and the unemployment levels rising. I think they will have to start trying to ease the lockdown rules and try and convince the public that it is safe to go back out if you follow the strict guidelines. News Throughout lockdown, I have listened to the news bulletins and ministerial briefings at 5pm as I find that easier than reading the information in a newspaper. The briefings are the most useful part in my opinion, as the media ask the questions that I want to know the answers to. Also, in most cases it is mainly used to transmit information and not as political rabble rousing or point scoring exercise. I think there should be BSL interpreters. It seems a no brainier especially when we need everyone to know what they need to do to keep safe and protect themselves from the epidemic. I have to say that Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland are much better than the English ones. There’s no waffle. She is sympathetic but not condescending and answers questions well and without hesitation. I think the main facts should be given as bullet points and then elaborated on and then the bullet points reiterated at the end, because sometimes you get caught up in an issue and then miss the next point which may be relevant to you. Work and home life I have been working during lockdown, which I haven’t found onerous. A lot of my usual work cannot be done out of the library, but as the only member of my team who is working, Iockdown has meant that I have had overall responsibility for all the library services jobs and so have found it easy to keep busy. My employer is paying furloughed staff the 20% top up on their salaries which does seem to be causing resentment amongst the 4 of us who are continuing to work. I think it depends on how long we are in lockdown, but I would be happy to be furloughed, if my employer decided to swap the staff around. I have worked every day since the library closed on 21 March and would have liked a day or two off on holiday when the weather was nice. I know from speaking to my friends and family that a lot of firms are paying the 80% only, or furloughing staff for 3 weeks and then swapping around the teams. As a manager, I do have a sense of responsibility and a decent work ethic, but I do think “where’s the incentive?” when my colleagues are getting paid to sit at home. As I have mentioned before, my husband and I are self-sufficient and don’t socialise a great deal, so we have found lowdown easy. We are childless too, so we haven’t had to worry about home schooling. Early on in lockdown, we agreed we may start to get on each other’s nerves, so we have a code word which we can say to take the heat out of the situation. It does work as well because we picked a funny word -SAUSAGES -which takes away the seriousness, and thus the temper. The only issues I have had is my husband’s reluctance to do jobs around the home! When we both were working, we shared the housework and did jobs around the house and garden at the weekend and on an evening. Like all homes, there are a few DIY tasks that needed more time and effort, which I had hoped he would do now he was at home all day. Also, within a week or so of lockdown, he received a letter sent to all employees telling them that the company was struggling financially, and there may have to be redundancies. As my husband was looking to reduce his hours, he opted to take voluntary redundancy. I realised that he would probably have a few weeks of relaxing at home, and then start looking to do some of the outstanding jobs, but he didn’t! Weeks went by and he didn’t do anything! In addition, we used to share the housework, which suddenly with a few exceptions seemed to be all my responsibility. I never wanted to be a nagging wife, but I did make my feelings known -especially as I was working, albeit from home. After a few rows, we have reached a compromise, but I still feel I am doing the lion’s share. Technology Before lockdown, we did FaceTime on occasion with our family and I have used it at work occasionally. We joined an online quiz in March with my niece and her husband who live in southern England. Since then, we have been taking it in turns to produce a quiz on a Thursday night. It’s more of a social event -the quiz is the excuse, but it has been great fun! I feel closer to them than before. We have used FaceTime for that and occasionally Zoom if there is interference. My boss was keen that the staff stayed in touch via Zoom and WhatsApp. Unfortunately, one of my colleagues didn’t have an Android phone so couldn’t access WhatsApp and her internet was still on dial up, so she would freeze or disappear altogether mid conversation. To be honest, I found the work Zoom socials a bit awkward at times, as some on my colleagues just sat there and didn’t speak much or went to the other extreme and talked over everyone!! I think we have enjoyed seeing each other but find them a bit awkward or strained sometimes. I have used Facebook and Instagram about the same amount as usual but started a WhatsApp group with 3 others who used to be volunteers at the library. One of them is my best friend so it has been a way of keeping in touch with her as we haven’t been able to meet up. Shopping and food We have continued to visit the supermarket each week as we are lucky enough to have a car. We have been combining it with a weekly visit to check on the library and collect books to post out. We do have to queue to go in, but this is only for at the most, half an hour and the weather has been kind. We have noticed that most people are not wearing masks, and some are not obeying the direction of travel signage. Some items have limits on how many you can buy, and we have noticed empty shelves in some of the supermarkets with things like eggs, flour, pasta, rice unavailable. We haven’t shopped online for groceries, but my friends tell me that it is almost impossible to get a slot. We are eating well, as we have more time to prepare meals and we have both put weight on as we are much more sedentary. We are also drinking more alcohol. We used to have a drink 3-4 nights a week, but now it’s every night, although not to excess. Entertainment and Leisure At the beginning of lockdown, we decided to start going for walks. This lasted a few weeks, but gradually we have stopped (we use all sorts of excuses for not going out!). We watch lots of daytime television, which of course, we would never have done when we went out to work. Most of it is rubbish, but we sometimes have the BBC news channel on in the background. I have been knitting as I promised 2 young relatives a knitted sloth. Now I am making myself a wrap and have also promised to make a blanket for my niece. My husband has been making up some model planes, cars and suchlike. He had loads of kits and has three part done but doesn’t look to be finishing them any time soon. He has also done lots of reading and I have when the weather has been good enough at the weekend to sit out. As mentioned earlier, we have been taking part in Zoom quizzes. A Wednesday night one with my husband’s pub quiz companions and the other withfamily. Personal hygiene It would have been easy to slob about during lockdown, but we decided that we would shower every day and not fall in to too many bad habits! I would usually colour my hair as soon as my grey roots showed through, but I have only done it once since lockdown started. I will carry on as normal once I’m back at work I suppose. As I have long hair, I have been able to get away with not having it cut, but my husband looks like a yeti, as his hair was supposed to have been cut one week after lockdown! It has been nice not to have to put makeup on every day as I did when I worked outside. The one thing that we have embraced though, is wearing comfortable clothes around the house. I don’t like to sit about in pyjamas, but I’m more than happy to get my joggers on! Another change is that we are wearing clothes for a few days at a time, and not chucking them in the wash after one wear. Better for the environment and less housework too. Sleep I have been going to bed later than when I went out to work and had to be up at 5.45am. Now I get up between 7.30am and 8.30am if I’m working, and a bit later if I’m not. I usually sleep well and haven’t been troubled by nightmares or anxiety, but sometimes I wake up early and things I have to do for work go round in my head, and I can’t fall back asleep, but that’s not unusual for me."

I wonder how long it can last and do as much as I can, without having to try too hard, to keep on top of the game. Currently, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic that is still sweeping the country, I try to keep shopping trips down to one major supermarket visit a week and I wear plastic gloves throughout and of course a face mask.  This also applies to brief visits to other shops, always kept to a minimum and at times of the day when I think they will be less crowded.  I take daily exercise -this afternoon, for instance, I walked for 50 minutes and covered about two miles, always trying to keep my distance from other people to the extent of crossing the road where necessary tp avoid  confrontation. As far as diet is concerned, I eat a variety of foods starting with a good daily breakfast of cereals, extra bran and prunes to try to keep “regular”.  Lunch is usually a sandwich with cheese, meat or smoked salmon, plus lettuce and tomato , followed by a banana or other fruit.  Supper can be one of many choices, usually home cooked but occasionally a ready meal, followed by a fruity dessert.  I drink very little alcohol and have never smoked, despite having grown up in a tobacconist’s shop. When I was a young man, I realised I was gay and took advantage of being a good-looking chap living in the heart of London.  Yes, I took chances but managed to survive unscathed and was lucky enough to share my life with the same loving partner from 1968 until he died in 2012.  He was a nurse and taught me a lot about wellbeing in both body and mind, introducing me for instance to the Mediterranean diet (he was Spanish) and the importance of varied menus. My parents did their best to bring up my brother and I on a limited income.  We always had three meals a day (many of my classmates at junior school in a poor part of London were less fortunate) but this included a fried breakfast every day for years, desserts like suet pudding and other fattening items, and D1602 the throwing away of the water vegetables had been cooked in rather than reusing it or having it as cold drink as I often do these days. I don’t recall puberty being a problem apart from the small nocturnal emissions that started to occur when I was about 15.  In those days such things weren’t talked about (although my parents were broadminded and would have undoubtedly answered my questions if I had asked them).  My brother and I knew that we “came from Mummy’s tummy” but I don’t recall asking for more details and was genuinely shocked at the age of 12 to hear a loud-mouthed boy at school describing the gory details.  “I’m sure the Queen wouldn’t do a thing like that” I recall saying very primly and disapprovingly, despite the fact that this was in 1954 and she was already the mother of two children! Both my father, his brother and my mother’s brother were slim throughout their lives and I take after them in build, being about 5ft 9ins tall, weighing a little over 60kg (note the mixture of metric and non-metric measurements) and my trouser sizes are 36in waist and 29 leg,  I always worked in offices and when I was in my late 40s my waist grew to a matching 40, a fact which horrified me so much that I’ve made a determined effort ever since to keep an eye on everything.  Since my partner died, I’ve become a member of two walking groups and although we can’t walk in groups temporarily, I still walk daily (weather permitting) as mentioned above. For mental exercise, which I think is of great importance, I regularly do cryptic and quick crosswords (and even devised some professionally at one stage in my life), Sudoku and similar puzzles, and latterly online jigsaws To my surprise, I have become coy in recent years about telling people my age as I don’t want them to realise how old I am in case they think I’m “getting past it”. When talking recently to a lady friend about vaccinations and when we were likely to get them, she gently probed to find out if I was 70 yet.  When I told her my true age, I was gratified to see that her jaw fell open in amazement.  On the other hand, when a woman in the supermarket queue a few weeks ago asked me whether I had had my vaccination yet, I said I wasn’t old enough ( at that stage they were doing the over-80s) and she seemed surprised . . . so you win some, you lose some! When it comes to appearance, I have mixed ideals.  On the one hand, I like to be reasonably colour co-ordinated in what I wear, on the other and since I started growing a beard during the first lockdown, I usually shave only once in D1602 about every six to seven days.  I feel strongly that men of my age shouldn’t wear jeans or earrings.  Comfort is of importance  and since the first lockdown and the combination of my age, a small bladder and the lack of public toilets, have started to wear what used to be called incontinence pants, although nowhere on the packs that I buy does this unattractive phrase appear. You can buy them now in a fashionable blue colour and they are very snug fit. What a pleasure it is to walk along the street or talking to someone while peeing, without them having any idea of what is happening beneath the surface,  Now this is something that really does contribute to good and happy health and wellbeing!

AUTUMN 2020 PART TWO EVERYDAY HEALTH AND WELLBEING Health, wellbeing and the healthy body I suppose to me the word health suggests free of disease, free of pain. I guess you could still have a sense of wellbeing if you did have pain or disease, it would depend how well you dealt with it. Some people will feel fantastically well with conditions that others would be devastated by. I think it’s more a mental state of mind. A healthybody is surely one that is free of disease. Fit, energetic. Can’t thinkof any more. No particular person comes to mind. Identity I can’t say that my own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced in any way by my gender, ethnicity, social class or sexual orientation, I can’t really see what any of those things have to do with it. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I have no idea when I would have first become aware of health or wellbeing, they are just terms that you know, absorbed from the ether. My mother would have been responsible for my health when I was young. I don’t ever remember anyone talking about my health. I was often ill as a young child but I didn’t need anyone to talk about it, I knew I was. My parents lived before the NHS and medical care was expensive. Therefore they didn’t seek it out. When people were ill they used home-made remedies and common sense and basically just got on with life. My mother suffered frequent black-outs as a child. She would be sent home from school after one of these incidents only to be sent straight back by her mother. Any spare money that could be used for medical emergencies was reserved to treat one of her brothers who had epilepsy. She would have learned not to complain about being ill. I don’t remember any education at school about health. Back then (in the 50s) people weren’t so self absorbed as they are now and there were far more important things to think about. Do people ever really learn about health in the way you suggest, don’t most of us just muddle through life and take whatever is thrown at us? Key moments I was a late developer and so I think I was about 13 when I started to become aware, when communal showers started to be an embarrassing problem, and there was much discussion of bras and “monthlies” in the 1 R.1025 changing room. There are no rituals I can think of, not in my life anyway. The first period always seemed like a momentous occasion. I lived in dread of it happening for a year or so and got quite paranoid about it. I hated it from day one and was never more glad of anything when 36 years later it stopped. Growing older In my adult life I’ve always been reasonably healthy. I’ve never been sporty but I always cycled and walked. I was brought up that way as my parents were always very active in that way.I’ve never been a drinker, smoked a few cigarettes in my teens but quickly stopped again, I’ve certainly never done drugs of any sort, scarcely take painkillers unless strictly necessary. I keep a watch on my weight, weighing myself each week and keeping a chart so that I can quickly react if I see my weight climbing. As far as mental health is concerned I think a lot of that is down to character, I just don’t have the sort of mind that dwells on things to the extent of causing me to be ill, I’m very much an optimist. I don’t think I’ve changed over the years. I would say that overall I’m pretty healthy, but if I were to list all the things wrong with me – from osteoporosis to IBS it would sound as if it was a miracle that I still considered myself healthy. As I use several health supplements these days, for my joints and my digestion, I receive a monthly magazine from the company that I use. I do glean odd bits of information from that, but I never actively seek out information on health issues. As my body has deteriorated over time I would say that I am more aware of it now. It doesn’t move in the way I still want it to move, I’m much slower at doing things than I want to be and it’s frustrating. I’m also aware of the way that, although my weight hasn’t changed much, the shape of my body has changed and is definitely less appealing. I hope my approach to health doesn’t change, but I could foresee a time when I just didn’t care anymore, if I should live that long. Health, wellbeing and appearance We talk of people being a picture of health don’t we? People who are healthy do tend to look well, and happy usually. I really don’t think I have been influenced by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance. I never read the type of magazines that promote that type of shallow awareness. Of course my parents would not have been influenced in any way. Life was about surviving, not trivialities like beauty and fame. They weren’t exposed to the media in those days as people are now. I guess the cinema gave them a little glimpse into the lives of glamorous people but they had no desire, nor means to be like that themselves, they would have known that was impossible. I would be very unhappy if I had to live without moisturiser, so I guess that would be my desert island item. Hand cream too is a must. Getting ready to leave the house I don’t recall either of my parents having any rituals to get ready for work (but you are testing my memory, that’s a very long time ago). They certainly never went out in the evening so that doesn’t apply. My own routine when going out is very minimal, slap a little bit of make up on, brush my hair and that’s it –done. I don’t suppose I’ve changed in at least 50 years, but I don’t think I did any more than that when I was young and at work. 2"

Apart from problems with my back my health has been the same as it usually is. I'm used to having a  massage once a  month so my back and shoulders ache.  Within a few days of our lockdown I bent over to picksomething up and my lower back seized up momentarily.  It was painful and stiff for a fewdays but I walked everyday which helped. Also I emailed my pilates teacher who suggested an exercise to help it That was rather an alarming time. Later one of my teeth felt as if it was loose and throbbed slightly. Again luckily it stopped after a couple of days. I have beengoing fora walk most days and also being doing pilates exercises. The classes have been available online. Emotionally I was most depressed about not seeing my partner who lives in England. Luckily the borders have now opened and he is able to get over. However the prospect of another spike in the autumn and winter is worrying. Initially, because I didn't realise how serious it could get, I		was annoyed that all my activities were cancelled. Especially as the over 65s were labelled as vulnerable so encouraged to isolate much earlier than the rest of the population. I'm quite an introvert so I can cope with my own company, especially as I live on my own and have learnt to deal with feelings of loneliness. I think I	was able to cope ok because the weather was good and I was able to watch the spring unfold on my daily walks. I quite liked the feeling of not having to get up and do things and I received more phone calls than I do normally. Luckily we never had a high amount of cases over here so I	wasn't that worried about myself or friends catching it which I am grateful for. I	did find after not going anywhere fora	few weeks that I was more nervous about driving and doing things I		haven't done for a	long time. The first time I went out in the car seemed very strange. The roads were much quieter and I almost felt as if I was doing something illegal as the lockdown was still on. It has been very unreal living through a situation that has never happened before. Mypartner was very frustrated at not being able to travel anywhere. I enjoyed not having sport on the media and no Jehovah's Witnesses calling.NewsI	read the Telegraph for my news. I watched the first emergency broadcast which was one evening but haven't really bothered with the daytime ones as it doesn't apply to us so much. Here on the Island we went into lockdown a couple of weeks before England so we have always been ahead. After being a bit slow starting up the leader of our local government and our health minister were having weekly media questionnaire broadcasts but these have stopped being so regular. I found that after a while I didn't really want too much news as it was just depressing and alarming and made me worry about things beyond my control. Chatting to a friend at the height of it all I remarked that we had never experienced hearing about such huge numbers of deaths. The largest I could remember was the 9/11 disasterwhich was 3,000 but thinking about the covid figures is so overwhelming you can't really take it in.TechnologyI only have a Nokia phone so was unable to use platforms available to Smartphones. I had Skype fixed up to communicate with my cousin in Canada but there were a lot of problems with it and I  found it very stressful so have given up on it. I'm not on any social mediaplatforms. While I probably missed out on things I suspect it also spared me a lot of the scare stories.Shopping and foodI have a  corner shop nearby so did a lot of my shopping there. Otherwise I  went to a farm shop which was also fairly close. Between the two of them I managed to get most of what I needed without too much queuing. I had stocked up fairly well beforehand. Also I  lost a  bitof weight not going to M & S for a couple of months and mainly cooking my own meals. I put off going to the main supermarkets for as long as possible.Entertainment and LeisureI	didn't take up any new hobbies or anything like that. Initially I rather idled about because my back was bad and got into the habit of watching Escape to the Country and did crosswords. I looked at websites especially one of a webcam of puffins in Alderney. After a while I	pulled myself together and did a bit more cleaning and tidying up of my house and cleared out few things and gardened. I typed up some wartime letters which my grandmother sent to my mother which was interesting. Looking back it seems like I didn't really achieve anything much and I've hardly done any painting however the days seemed to go byespecially if I went for a long walk and there was housework to do. One day I spent about 3 hours on the phone.Personal hygiene and sleepI		don't remember my sleep being affected much and if anything I had more baths as it was something to start the day off with."

Retired journalist. Married Living in Darlington. One daughter 44, not living at home Autumn directive part 2 Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health to me means having no ongoing or chronic conditions, feeling able to eat well, being physically fit and able to undertake any activity necessary or enjoyable. Five words: weight, mobility, diet, attitude, knowledge. The person who comes to mind is a schoolfriend who trained as a PE teacher and emigrated to Australia. She now lives, alone since her husband died, in a fairly remote part of Queensland. She is a keen folk dancer, plays pickleball (whatever that is, it sounds energetic), is a volunteer firefighter, and a great traveller, preferably by the most obscure route or method of travel she can find. She is about 5ft 6ins, no spare flesh and still with the same, short boyish haircut she had at school. Identity I suppose my health has been influence by my sex, in that I had gynaecological treatment at one time. Then there’sheredity –skin problems and migraine. I don’tthink any of such illnesses as I have had are influenced by ethnicity or social class. I do have problems with anxiety but have never taken them to the GP, just learned to live and cope with them and I think they are the result of upbringing. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Health was always around, in the sense that my mother enjoyed ill health and from any age at all I was aware that she regarded her health as fragile. Wellbeing wasn’t a word I was really aware of, I don’t think it was a word in common currency in the 1940s and 1950s. You were either ill or well. The older of my two younger brothers was a neo-natal death and the younger was never well so he was always to the forefront of any care that went on. He spent his first five years trying to die of various things like croup, pneumonia and pleurisy then aged about 11, his acute appendicitis was not diagnosed until the organ was almost gangrenous. I had the usual childhood infections and was looked after in bed by my mother with meals and calamine lotion. I do remember going to secondary school feeling very under the weather because I didn’t feel it would be acceptable to ask to stay at home. There was no talk about health or staying healthy. At junior school, the girls has a talk by a very embarrassed deputy head about “growing up”, with instructions to tell our mothers that this had taken place. I did, and wished I hadn’t as it unleashed a stream of her own worst experiences. At the girls’ grammar I attended, those of us in the A stream, where the timetable did not include biology as that was for the B stream (!), had a year of something called “hygiene” which did include general health advice but was mainly to ensure we understood human reproduction. At this distance, 60-odd years, I can remember nothing about what we were told, only the chain-smoking PE teacher who took the class. Key moments Bodily changes – when the girls in the final year of junior school all took a terrific interest in who was developing a bust. Inspections were conducted in the class storeroom -2­W633 I suppose the first period is a significant moment for girls. I was staying with my grandmother but, in a kindly moment, my mother had packed me some protection “in case”. I couldn’t talk to Granny or ask questions, home was nearly 200 miles away so I just coped. Growing older I’ve been lucky inthat I don’tput onweight, though I lose it easily in times of stress. I do, however, try to eat a healthy diet and,, oncewe became aware that heart attackswere a heredity problemin my husband’sfamily, our diet was framed by that. We eat a lot of fruit and vegetables and tend to have much less red meat than we did in our 30os and 40s. We walk to destinations in town, rather than take the bus or car, unless there was a time factor or heavy shopping involved and we have always been keen folk dancers, though that has been somewhat curtailed by Covid-19 this year. My husband isn’t a worrier, I am, but we are both practising Anglicans and church and the church “family” has a beneficial effect, again hit by Covid this year. I read and listen to the radio rather than watch television so I tend to get health information and advice from newspapers and magazine or programmes like You and Yours. I’ve always beenconscious of having thighs likejodhpurs in spite of a BMI of 21.5-22 and I still look at them and wonder why no amount of specific exercise to reduce them has ever had the tiniest effect. As I get older, given that I am now 78, I expect to carry on with the régime that has got me thus far, hoping that I stay physically and, more important, mentally OK. Health, wellbeing and appearance. People who feel well probably walk head up and looking cheerful. The popular ideals of appearance as they appear in glossy magazines, on TV and the like are models, or templates, of what we should aim at, men and women. Some people achieve “the look” of the moment. Most people pick what they like, adapt other aspects and just make the best of ourselves. I would hear my mother comment on fashions but was never aware of her being influenced by ideals. My father, after an illness when he could not shave for some time, found that, in spite of his black hair, his beard grew white. Years later he said, “I should have kept that beard,2 feeling that the distinctive appearance might have gained more attention in his career. On a desert island, given thatI couldn’thave the medication for myskin, I’d have to have the largest possible bottle of a rich body lotion. Getting ready to leave the home I don’t think my parents had rituals, more a routine. My father always wore a suit, shirt and tie for work and for going out. My mother never went out to work, going to the shops was just a matter of tidiness and a bit of lipstick. When it came to social events, she always found some excuse for backing out, usually health, so I never saw her getting dolled up. After she died, my father asked if I would accompany him to his formal engagements and I realised how much her presence would have meant to him. For that reason, I always tried to look my best because I felt my appearance reflected on him. I never leave the house without basic makeup – moisturiser, some sort of foundation or solid base, eyeshadow, liner and lipstick, a matter of habit partly because I had to look my best every day at work and partly because I take after my father’s sisters. end."

She was the main person looking after me, I don't remember my father being influential in my upbringing in any wasy.I can't remember any health education in school at all, but it is nearly 60 years ago now. The internet wasn't around then so information and advise on heatlh and wellbeing was gleaned from magazines and friends or relatives.Key moments.As a nurse, my mother told me about periods etc. I started mine at the age of 12 and we were all prepared - I can remember that day vividly, nothing really prepares you for it.My first bra was a red and blue check cotton bra from 'M&S' I always remember it.Growing older.When you're yuoung you have a parent or someone to look after your health, making sure you visit the dentist or doctor when needed, keeping you clean, eating the right foods etc. In adulthood all the responsibility is on you and it's often easy to neglect areas of your health and wellbeing.Over the years I have had issues with my mental and physical health, which I have dealt with nby myself, particuaarly mental health, and medical concerns I have had investigations for and eventually minor surgery, but have not kept up to date with monitoring and screening afterwards, due to reluctance and fear on my part.At 60 I think I am totally familiar with my body and can recognise any changes in how I look and feel. In the future I think I will still be as aware of my health and wellbeing, but will probably still be a bit blase about it.M6787Female Age 60Living with partner WimborneNot working now, but previously worked in shops, offices, garden centres, with horsesAutumn Directive 2020Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and appearanceIf your health and wellbeing are not as they should be it can show in your expression or the way you walk - slower and with not enthusiasm, if you're in some sort of pain or feeling stressed or worried.When you're feeling good in yourself you move more engrgetically and look up and ahead, with more purpose.I have never been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance, and I don't think my parents were.My 'Desert Island' itwm would be talcum powder - 'Johnson's Baby' powder - as I use this daily and love its soft, delicate smell, but I could live without it 'Getting ready to leave the houseGrowing up, my parents always worked where we lived so there was no 'going out to work.'They rerely went out, only to work-related 'dos' when they'd dress up in a nice shirt and tie, or a sparkly dress.I no longer work, but when I go out to socialise I'll have a shower and put on something other that my usual scruffin about at home clothes.Comb hair, clean teeth, mouthwash, no make-up of any sort - I use to when I was younger, but not for years now, I prefer the 'natural look8 for myself."

Next week on the 1st of JUne, outdoor markets and car showrooms will be alllowed to open and from the 15th of June all shops will be allowed to open. There is some debate whether schools, or atleast primary schools will open on the 1st of June, but a lot of parents and teachers are against this as it will be difficult to maintain safe distances between young children. There have been a few cases of hypocrisy among Government officials where they have flouted the very rules they have imposed on the general publicby travelling great distances themselves to see family when it was deemed unsafe to do so.NewsWe buy a daily newspaper but don't watch the television for news, we're not ignorant or complacent but don't need to saturate ourselves with it. We also see updates on our mobile phones­ national and local news. I think there should definitely be a sig sign language interpreter at the briefings and am surprised that there is only now a petition under way at this late stage.Work and home lifeMy partner and I are both retired but being restricted in our movements and things being closed or suspended for a while we are confined to home more that we normally would be. We moved just before lockdown, me to a place I've known all my life si I've returned to 'old' friends and family, which is a comfort even though we can't yet meet up as we used to.02.Q)M6787FemaleLiving with partner WimborneNot working now, but previously worked in shops, offices, garden centres, with horses.Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covidl9 (Update)TechnologyI keep in touch with family and friends by phone, email, text or on Facebook - in the first few weeks of lockdown I felt a need to ring up people I haven't spoken to in years, we usually keep in touch by email but you can't beat talking to each other on the phone, it feels more personal and spontaneous. Facebook I only us use for groups I belong to, a local one of my town past and present, and a couple of Nature and wildlife photography groups, they take you away from the real world as it is now.Shopping and FoodIn 'normal' times we would usually do a 'big shop' once a weeek or fortnight, going to either of the cheaper supermarkets. At the very beginning of the lockdown we went in one of the designated early morning slots for the vulnerable but found this to be a horrendous experience as, although there was 2 metre distancing outside the store, they were not limiting the number of people being let in so it was all crowded and people not keeping their distance at all.So since then we have just used local shops and supermarkets which are within easy walking distance of home. I think our eating/cooking habits are more or less the same, surprisingly we haven't been eating more unhealthy foods such as chocolate or crisps, but in moderation as usual.Entertainment and LeisureWe haven't taken up any new hobbies but probably increased the amount of time we spend on our current ones, whcih are drawing aa and painting in my partners' case, and writing and photographyin mine.My exercxise has definitely increased as I was bought a bicycle for my birthday and am out on it at least once a day. Walking to town is also a new activity which we do most days.I spent my 60th birthday in lockdown so it wasn't quite how I'd planned it to be, when I would've got together with friends and maybe had a picnic at a local park. My partner and I did drive ou out to a nearby village and walked and took photos. I will probab-ly have a belated 69th celebration with friends when it's possible.I took out 6 books from the library just before they had to closeand I've read 5 of them, ranging from Terry Wogan's writings Helen Lederer's novel, 2 murder mysteries and a true story inspired novel about a woman in America who refuses to move when a shopping mall is being built all round her.M6787FemaleLiving with partner WimborneNot working now, but previously worked in shops, offices, garden centres, with horsesSpring Directive 2020 Part 2: Covidl9 (Update)CONTD: Entertainment and LeisureAs usual I've been listening to Radio 4 Extra, which is a mixture of drama and classic and new comedy. I thought I would use the opportunity of lockdown to watch or re-watch DVD's that I have - comedies and countryside ones - but this hasn't happened - yet.Television has been the usual things I'd watch,- 'Sewing Bee', 'Great British Menu8 ', 'Grayson Perry's Art Club', 'QI’ but as usual I can take it or leave it, I'd rather be outside if it's fine enough.Personal HygieneWHere we live now, having moved here in early March, we have a much better shower, so it is a pleasure to use it. Like most people my hair is growing like mad and well past its usual cutting date - it was last cut in December, so I'm  longing to get it done. I bought some big hair clips so I can make a short pony tail or clip it back at the sides. The warm weather doesn't help !SleepI never sleep much at the best of times, so at the beginning of lockdown I found it very hard to get to sleep and if I did would keep waking up. This has luckily diminished, maybe helped by the increase in exercise I'm having. If I can't sleep I'll put my earphones in and listen to the radio until I drop off. Or I'll ge get up and make a milky drink and read until I'm tired."

My eldest son has just begun to work as a civil servant as a regulating body for safety of lorries, buses, horse boxes etc. and a whiz on computers. He lives with his partner of 24. years.My youngest son is married with stepdaughters and their own son who is 23 years.of age. He is an electrician. And is a granddad to 6 boys.I have retired 12 years from an elderly persons residential home	I am the secretary for the Womens' Section of the Royal British Legion (I do fmd it a bit stuffy) but do enjoy meals and outings with them, so it has to a certain extent broadened my horizon. What I have found in this organisation that there is a lot of bickering and back stabbing - which I find atrocious in that the main aim is to raise enough money to give to HQ for their much needed funds for the soldiers and families of those stricken by the wars in Afghanistan. Syria etc.I have written ever since my children were very small and have had a few articles published. As I get older, I want to record social history more.I still live in a 3-bedroomed house and manage to keep it decorated and would quite happily spend all day in the garden. Have acquired a bichon/poo dog from the dogs trust now nearly 5yrs old who although a challenge in the beginning has opened up the countryside to me and is loved by all.My sons help me out ifl go out for a long day, in letting him out when necessary. He's cream and tan cute, frisky, very destructive but everything is kept high and out of reach.,JF.218EVERYDAY HEALTH AND WELLBEING.I have felt disturbed with things going on during this pandemic.Unfortunately there are failings around Govt. decisions. Latterly with the vaccinations for all by Spring is slowed down by supplies low in numbers and the delivery to the services that do injections not happening as they should. I remember the elation felt when vaccines had been tested but now we are tired and still mourning losses that have hit so many.Not enough hospital beds yet 3 new Nightingale hospitals yet to be filled. The truth is that there are not enough staff with nurses and doctors going sick and in many cases dying whilst serving the public. It is totally out of control.My sleep pattern in general is less and spasmodic. I am eating twice as much as normal which I know is comfort-eating. I feel the stress within the family. Yes, we value each other more. 'We will get through this together Mum' meant something in the beginning but wears thin because the light at the end of the tunnel is fading.I do not enjoy shopping - its just basics and you feel everyone is staring at you for mask, hand disinfecting - not getting too near, make sure you are on the line and being shouted at...F.218I enjoyed my own hours in the garden - I could still swim inbetween lockdowns. I could go on a bus most days to explore.Buses are still running - empty - very high disease in market town Ipswich, Suffolk. Cars are being stopped and fined where rules are being breached.Library books - friends and family are helping me out but they are few and far between.I am allowed to walk the dog twice a day - good for us both - but we have floods and mud everywhere. And I am besieged with workman next door who don't clear up after themselves! I know this is all petty but major irritations along with cutbacks, very stressful.Physically I am ok. Mentally under stress. I am not the most calm person in ordinary times.When I was a young child because I was under the umbrella of Social Services there was a channel of safety but in effect, I never spoke to them - they came and went.Wellbeing etc. at primary and secondary was general health about changes in bodies at certain stages. We did exercise with games and outdoor swims- freezing and unenjoyable because staff had many layers of clothes and we froze.. ,....F.218I have always exercised during every part of my life - necessity and enjoyment. I do everything in moderation. I am mid-70's now, an observerFreedom has gone in every sense of the word. 1st lockdown happened in our glorious hot summer in 2020. No hardship then.Having makeup and hair dye are things I cannot do without. I have a friend who unofficially cuts my hair even during lockdown. With these wretched face masks, I now use heavier eye makeup - have to take spectacles off a lot with them steaming up with winter weather. I find that I only need them for distance and reading prices in shops etc.The only change in leaving the house is that I must not forget masks, keys, dogs paraphernalia and right money cards etc. I no longer use a handbag as I did visiting other shops, outings etc."

I’m thinking of someone like Adriene Mischler, the online yoga teacher. A beautiful healthy young woman who also seems kind, grounded and spiritual, so in a good place mentally as well as physically. I visualise her doing yoga, indoors (this is how I’ve seen her, as I’ve followed some of her videos). I suppose my health and wellbeing has been affected by the fact I am a woman, and by my social class. Being a woman means I’ve had periods, I’m subject to hormone cycles, I’ve had to deal with contraception, I’ve had fertility treatment, two miscarriages, gave birth, breastfed my child. I’m in my late forties so the menopause is starting to show itself. These have all had effects on my health. Being middle class and comfortable financially has probably contributed to not having any major ongoing health issues. I’ve been able to access private healthcare when I’ve wanted to. I first became really aware of health in my thirties I think. I did join a gym in my late twenties but that was more because it looked fun and luxurious than because I was really serious about being healthy. I remember in my thirties noticing that my cohort of friends were all becoming more sensible, drinking less, going out less. It was probably a mixture of people focusing on their careers more and just generally growing up and priorities shifting. Most of my friends had some kind of physical hobby that they did regularly -weight training, running, tai chi, swimming. I joined a gym for the first time in around 1999 but only started to get really into it in 2003. I used to go to classes four times a week, I was addicted and loved it. In 2008 I had to give up the gym as my schedule changed and I couldn’t get there often enough to justify the expense, but I started dancing Five Rhythms and doing Bikram Yoga instead. Then in around 2011 I started seeing a personal trainer once a week, we only stopped last year. We used to do weight training and HIIT, I really enjoyed it. Last summer I did Couch to 10K and now I run around twice a week, including a 10K most Sundays. I’m experimenting with various online yoga and weight training options, I haven’t quite found the right one yet. And I still dance when I can. I really enjoy exercise if it’s the sort of thing I like, I fantasise about fitting more exercise into my life. I was never sporty at school and don’t really identify as a sporty or healthy person so I’m pleased that I’ve found some exercise that works for me nevertheless. I’m very keen for my son to enjoy some kind of physical activity, I’ve paid for him to try ballet, tap, judo and fencing as well as his school sports. I want him to have a sport that is ‘his’ if it turns out he doesn’t like school team sports, as was the case for me. Now that I’m getting older, and am a parent of a young child, health seems much more important. I worry about it a lot more than I used to. I had a cancer scare when my son was two years old and even though it was a very treatable kind of cancer (and I didn’t have it anyway in the end) it was so frightening to think I might die and leave my child. But I am overweight and don’t do enough about that. It is hard when you are part of a family and eat as a family and don’t have full control over what you eat, really. My husband does most of the cooking, which I’m very grateful for, but it means I feel I should accept what he makes for us. We are a bit of a bad influence on each other. And I like eating puddings and cakes. Married London Chartered Accountant I gave up drinking when I was pregnant with my son and never started again. For a long time this was because I was breastfeeding, but even when that stopped, I didn’t start. I felt so ambivalent about it. I missed drinking a little bit, but didn’t want to go back to my old ways of drinking too much, I would often drink a bottle of wine in one evening. I didn’t have faith I could drink moderately, and I don’t like the idea of not being my normal self around my child, because I’m drunk or hungover. So I still don’t drink and it’s been seven years now. It helps that my husband doesn’t drink either, so I’m not tempted at home. You can get some really good non-alcoholic beers and wines now and I drink those when I fancy something. I first became aware of ‘well being’ fairly recently. It’s obviously become a massive trend in the last few years. There were lots of cookbooks about healthy eating, yoga was really popular, athletic clothes were fashionable. One of my favourite clothes retailers is Sweaty Betty, for a long time I only used to wear their stuff when exercising, but since my son has been born I wear their stuff a lot more, still when exercising but also the rest of the time too. It’s so comfortable and stylish. I’m also thinking of things like the Goop website and Instagram, neither of which I’ve looked at, but you hear about them anyway. Wellbeing seems to be something that really appeals to women in particular and is marketed at us. Of course it’s good to be healthy and to try to be happy, but I do suspect it’s also missing the point a bit. Women who are stressed out or exhausted, looking after everyone else, do need to take a bit of time to take care of themselves but also need the external stress to be alleviated, or wellbeing is just another thing to worry about and feel guilty about. I feel bad because I ‘should’ be meditating and doing yoga and exercising and I can’t fit it all in. I don’t really remember my parents talking to me about health. We ate healthily, but it all felt quite spartan. I remember every year we used to go on holiday, self-catering in the UK, and for that two weeks my sister and I were allowed to eat junk food -I remember buying milkshake syrup, flavoured rice, angel delight, those little mini boxes of cereal. It was a real treat as we never ate this kind of food the rest of the time. I didn’t go to a fast food restaurant until I was an adult. I remember only starting to go to coffee shops as a young woman -we never used to stop for a coffee while out shopping when I was growing up. We only had fizzy drinks at Christmas. An ice cream was a special occasion. I had to ask permission to eat a biscuit. Mum used to bake cake but it was very basic fruit cake. My Nana used to bring little mini trifles for us when she visited every fortnight. Food at home generally wasn’t that nice and I think it’s caused me to be too self-indulgent as an adult, now that I can eat what I like. Growing up I was thin, because I didn’t eat for pleasure. Even now I dislike my mum’s slightly joyless food tendencies. In particular, after a meal she’ll announce ‘fresh fruit’ as a pudding and then cut up and eat an apple or orange while everyone sits and watches her. It annoys me, I don’t think an apple is pudding! I would certainly never offer one to a guest as part of a meal -I’d make or buy something special. I particularly remember my mum going through a phase of making me and my sister drink a milkshake every day made with cocoa powder with a raw egg mixed into it. The combination used to make the milkshakes go grey and they really weren’t nice. One day I had a moment of revolt and poured my milkshake over my sister’s head. It wasn’t intended as an attack on Married London Chartered Accountant my sister, just general rebellion against the milkshakes. As far as I can remember I got away with it without getting into too much trouble, everyone was just so surprised. Sometimes now I eat something very delicious and healthy and my whole body kind of purrs, there’s a wonderful sense of nourishment and satisfaction. So I know it is possible to get pleasure from really healthy food but I don’t really know how to reproduce it -or generally make the effort to find out. Nobody talked about the importance of exercise when I was young. We did dancing lessons but that was just another activity, like brownies. PE at school was just the standard sports, like netball. I’m actually really pleased that as an adult I’ve managed to reinvent myself as someone who does really enjoy some types of exercise. Nobody talked about mental health. -in particular, everyday mental health, people who aren’t actually mentally ill but still suffering mental distress in some way. That’s everywhere now but feels new. The only mention of health I remember at school was being taught about periods in a special session at junior school. They separated the boys and the girls, and the girls had a talk from a woman. All I remember about that was her putting a tampon in a glass of water to show us how it worked! We had the usual PE lessons but it was just another part of the school day, I don’t remember anyone talking about the importance of being healthy. My sister (a year younger than me) had her first period before me. I remember her coming home from school in quite a tense mood and speaking to my mum and going into the downstairs toilet, which we didn’t really use. I anxiously asked my mum if I could see, and she held out my sister’s bloody pants, a bit nonplussed. It looked quite alarming. My mum was very supportive when I started my periods. I was finding it hard to deal with the discomfort and she was fine with me taking painkillers. She was happy to buy every kind of sanitary towel and tampon for me until I’d found the ones I liked best. I was dismayed at the prospect of going on like this until I was middle aged, but I got used to it. My mum wasn’t so good on other aspects of puberty. I remember wanting a bra and some deodorant (possibly earlier than I actually needed them, but I wanted to be prepared) and finding it hard to mention to her, worrying that she’d say ‘no’ or be cross with me. I think she found it a bit hard to see me growing up. I remember wearing some dungarees a lot, I must have been no older than 11, then pulling them out to wear again the following summer and my mum giving me a big hug and saying ‘oh my little girl!”, as if I’d changed in the intervening year and she didn’t like the new version of me so much. She never guided me with things like shaving or make up, although she did both herself. I always felt unskilled and awkward with these things, and still do. I remember my first pubic hair growing and thinking it was a loose hair and trying to brush it away before realising it was part of me. Married London Chartered Accountant I’ve always been quite happy with my body though. Even though I know I have flaws, like everyone, I’m fundamentally content. It’s really helped that I’ve never had anyone in my life who tried to criticise my appearance (even though I only have normal looks). My parents never commented on it, they were more focused on how well I did at school and how well behaved I was. None of my lovers have dared, some of them turned out to be abusive but I think they must have guessed I wouldn’t have stood for that. It’s funny how some criticism can really wound and other things just bounce off and are laughable. Now, in my late forties, I feel slightly anxious about my health. I worry about the menopause and how bad that will be. I feel like it’s already starting. I’ve put on quite a lot of weight in the last couple of years which I don’t think is entirely down to my eating habits. I have difficulty sleeping when I used to fall asleep pretty much as soon as I went to bed, I used to joke that I could go to sleep whenever I wanted to, and how useful it was when I was stuck somewhere and feeling bored. I’ve pretty much lost interest in sex. I feel quite glum and withdrawn a lot of the time and I wonder if that’s hormonal. My skin isn’t as clear as it used to be -people often used to say I looked young for my age, but that definitely isn’t the case now. Because my son is young it seems extra important to stay healthy and alive, so that I am here for him. I take a range of vitamin supplements (feeling slightly ashamed and judged as a gullible woman by my husband, even though he hasn’t shown any negativity towards me -I’m projecting). I do a long run (10K) most weeks. I dance when my dancing events are on. I periodically do yoga and meditate although not with any consistency -it’s so hard to fit in around the family and work. My diet isn’t great, I have fairly healthy breakfasts and lunches (at the moment, overnight oats and an egg with lentils or avocado, or a big salad) but eat a lot of snacks, puddings and carb-heavy dinners. I don’t drink alcohol at all, or smoke, though. There are no health or beauty products that I couldn’t live without, but I’d very much miss face moisturiser and hair conditioner. I have a lovely face oil too which I put on top of my moisturiser at night. I like luxurious bath products like bath oil and scrubs. I use soap instead of shower gel after reading that it keeps you cleaner (also it’s more environmentally friendly of course). I often use body moisturiser. A couple of years ago, feeling my age, I started spending more on skin care so now I sometimes use exfoliators, serums and masks. I have a Beauty Pie subscription and do enjoy browsing that website -I went a bit mad when I first joined and got quite a lot of stuff but now just buy the odd nice t thing. It seems simpler buying everything from one website, which the subscription encourages you to do. I don’t wear make up, about 50/50 because I never really have, and my husband doesn’t like it. I don’t mean that he’s controlling me but it seems a bit pointless to do something to supposedly make you more attractive that actually makes you less attractive. It is nice that he likes me as I am! I used to get my hair coloured, eyebrows shaped and tinted and a gel manicure every time I went to the hairdresser, 3 or 4 times a year. I loved the way it looked, but it was so expensive, over £150 a time. Just before Covid hit, my hairdresser moved back to Spain Married London Chartered Accountant where he was from, originally. I’d been seeing him for 20 years so it was daunting finding someone new. Then we had the lockdowns so currently I haven’t my hair done for 16 months and am letting the grey come through. A bit of me would like to go back to my old look but the cost is off-putting and I feel very middle aged and that I can’t hide the ageing and might as well embrace it. I don’t really care, it’s so annoying that middle aged women become invisible but also that’s how I feel, invisible, not interested in catching people’s attention any more. I think my cancer scare a few years ago was a bit of a watershed for me. Until then I hadn’t had any particular health issues apart from the small things that affect everybody. Now I have the history of having had the fear of cancer, and having an operation (they thought it might be thyroid cancer and removed half my thyroid). In a small way it’s hard to accept, I don’t want to admit to myself that something went wrong with my body. My parents (79 and 80) are very well considering their age, so I have a tendency to assume I will be too, and I have to remind myself it’s not guaranteed. I have a baseline of liking and respect for my body. I would never feel dislike of my body, that would be really foreign to me. I do notice that I’m overweight, my hair is going grey, my skin is less radiant than it used to be. But I’m not remotely interested in attracting strangers, my husband loves me anyway, so my main feeling is that I wish I looked less ‘round’ in clothes, and could fit into clothes in smaller sizes, so that I could buy clothes from shops I really like but am too big for (I’m size 18). I don’t mind getting older -I have actually always found older women attractive. I hope to be more fit and healthy when I’m older. I’m definitely less flexible than I used to be. I need to find the time to exercise more and eat more healthily. I think this will actually come as my little boy gets older and doesn’t need so much input from me. I don’t think I’ve been very much influenced by popular ideals of what is beautiful. I still like the looks now that I liked as a teenager thirty years ago -flowing, hippy clothes for women, long skirts and hair. Tailoring for men (I like men in waistcoats!), and longish hair. No make up. I saw some photos the other day of young women going out to nightclubs in New York. They were all thin, long haired, wearing short tight dresses and very high heels. They looked anxious and miserable, adhering to the popular ideal of ‘beautiful’ and ‘sexy’, but to me they weren’t either of these (maybe men would think differently). I imagined what they’d look like in comfy jeans and t-shirts and trainers, sitting on a sofa, relaxed and laughing together. I actually really wanted to see that version. I don’t think my parents were influenced by popular ideals of health and beauty at all. They did the basics, they looked ordinary. They valued different things. I do remember that occasionally when I was little, in the 70s or 80s, my mum and dad would go out to dinner dances. My dad would wear black tie and my mum would wear a long dress with a fake fur coat, and wear perfume. I remember that they seemed very glamorous, I used to love seeing them all dressed up before they went out. Apart from that, my dad wore a suit to work every day and my mum (a teacher) would put on a bit of make up, but that was it. I don’t really ‘get ready’ at all, even for work. I put on deoderant, brush my hair and Married London Chartered Accountant teeth, wash my face and put moisturiser on, and that’s generally it. I dress as casually as I can get away with at work too -jersey dresses, cardies, comfy leggings and jumpers, trainers or knee boots. I used to like wearing jewellery that my husband had bought for me, but I stopped when my baby was born in case he pulled at it, and haven’t started again."

Female, 67, single – living with partner. London. Retired civil servant. Autumn 2020 Directive Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health We all have health, and it can be good, bad etc It includes a physical as well as a mental/emotional component. Wellbeing I see this as referring to one’s mental state and feelings. It is possible to be physically healthy, but have a low level of wellbeing, if the person isn’t happy or comfortable with themselves or their circumstances. “A healthy body”. Flexibility, muscle, energy, vitality, strength. I think of someone, not necessarily young, but generally lean and strong and I visualise them walking or running, or carrying out some form of exercise. They have a bright, alert expression. Identity I felt quite different to my friends when I was growing up. I was attracted to girls and aware that this was something I needed to keep quiet about. At that time, lesbianism was rarely talked about, and when it was, it was usually considered shameful. This didn’t bother me. In fact, I was quite happy with my secret. I occasionally dated boys, and felt quite flattered by their attention, but I never felt at all involved. Meanwhile, feminism had arrived, lesbianism was on the agenda and role models started to appear. This was perfect timing for me as I now had serious validation. I have always felt very positive about being a lesbian. I have some lovely friends and am now in a settled relationship. I have never wished to be anything other. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I probably first became aware of health when I had my first illness, which was chickenpox. My parents looked after my health and wellbeing. I can’t remember the term wellbeing being used, but my parents were very keen that I didn’t go without, but also anxious that I wasn’t spoiled, so grew up with a mantra that you have to work to achieve and be rewarded. This I still follow. Health was discussed occasionally by my mother. She was very concerned that I eat properly in order to stay healthy. She would cook nourishing meals, but such things as sweets and fizzy drinks were banned as they would lead to spots and obesity. My grandmother was overweight and liked her sweets so was sometimes held up as an example. My grandmother was also very obliging and happy to give me sweets when I visited her . Key moments I started my periods at 13 ½. This was a year earlier than my mother, she told me. The subject was never discussed prior to me starting my periods. However, I was already aware of what would happen through talking to friends and reading, so I wasn’t worried, which is just as well as it would have been quite alarming! I remember telling my mother when I started my first period and she told me to take it easy, and handed me a home-made sanitary belt and packet of very bulky sanitary pads, but no other instruction. I remember the girls and boys in my class at roughly age 13, being separately given a session on, in the girls’ case, periods and the implications of being sexually mature. At around the same age I would sometimes go to the local Boots which had a section of popular medical books, and surreptitiously read bits around sex and reproduction, which I didn’t seem to be getting a clear picture of. In addition to those listed, in the mid 1960s in my community, wearing makeup was a fairly important ritual, which would happen at around 15/16. I wasn’t interested in wearing makeup, but felt obliged to give it a try. The pressure came, not from my friends, but from my mother, who, I think, felt that I was a bit of a tom boy. I bought some and tried it at home. It was too dark and I wasn’t prepared to wear it going out, so I threw it away and have never worn it since. Fortunately for me, the trend during my late teens and twenties, was for a more natural look, so it ceased to be an issue. I was skinny and flat chested in my early teens, and a fairly late bra-wearer. I remember being a bit embarrassed about that, and envying my slightly older cousin who had developed quicker. Growing older I was very active physically as a child; always running around. I enjoyed tennis as a teenager and into my twenties, and played regularly at local clubs, and more informally. I didn’t exercise much when I went to university, but maintained a healthy appetite and put on a couple of stone. I then taught in Africa for three years and lost the additional weight as I was living a much simpler life. Once I returned to UK and started working, I started a morning run several times a week and continued that until a few years ago when I started to get twinges in my lower back, and felt that my knee joints had suffered too. I miss running terribly. I’ve also been a regular gym attendee in the past. Currently, we are in lockdown again because of a surge in the pandemic since Christmas. It is winter too, and I am going out much less than usual. Since the first lockdown in March 2020, I have done less exercise than at any other time. I haven’t put on weight as I tend to stay a constant healthy weight as I do not overeat, and I have also been seeking out and preparing nutriscious meals. I look after my mental health by keeping in regular contact with friends and, in normal, non-Covid times, have a good balance of things to do, social, educational, and voluntary. During the pandemic I am doing voluntary work outside my home once a week, and am involved as an interviewer and summariser for a national oral history project, plus other bits and pieces such as research for a local hospital campaign, and these directives, of course! Occasionally, an article about health and wellbeing will catch my eye from the BBC or the “I” newspaper, but I don’t particularly seek them out. If I do have an area of concern about my health, for example, I had an unexplained rash a few years ago, I have a look on the internet first, as I’m sure is common, and go to the doctor if it persists. In this case, the doctors were baffled too, and it cleared up of its own accord. I am now more aware of my body than I was. I have been very lucky over the years. I was around 60 when I had to stop running because of the lower back problem. Since then, I have developed floaters in my eyes, tinnitus, and require regular ear wax removal. None of these conditions have a particularly sinister explanation, but all remind me that I am getting older, and that is the usual explanation given. I think that in future years I will become more anxious about my health. I can’t particularly say that I will be more careful, as I think I have been pretty careful most of my adult life. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think that good health and wellbeing will be reflected, to a certain extent, in appearance. Someone who is physically and mentally well is likely to radiate a positive external appearance. I would imagine this to be a suitable weight, clear skin, animation. When I was a teenager was the time when I was influenced by popular ideals of physical appearance. This was partly driven by my mother, who had two areas of concern; acne, and weight. I had fairly mild facial acne, but she took me to the doctor who prescribed tablets. I’ve no idea what they were, but I took them, and again, have no idea whether they helped. My mother also bought me a number of creams which I applied. I was also aware that I was likely to grow out of it, and so it proved. I was very skinny until my mid-teens. Even then, at my heaviest, I was still within a healthy BMI range, though we never talked about BMI in those days. Nevertheless, my mother hinted at one stage that I might consider wearing an undergarment such as a corset. I didn’t, but bought a calorie counter booklet and had a go at reducing my calorific intake. I kept the booklet with me for many years and still feel sub-consciously influenced. I was a tomboy, and still am, and my mother was unhappy that I never wore make-up. She always had her hair permed, and dyed when she went grey. I have had my very straight hair cut in various styles over the years, but have never had it permed or coloured. I’m still not totally grey. I remember one time when my mother, who occasionally wore wigs, got me, very reluctantly, to try on one that she had been wearing. I looked in the mirror and realised that I looked like her, and that this was really what she wanted for me. I was quite horrified! I couldn’t live without toothpaste, and I use face, hand and body cream daily. This is only in the last few years as I had a fairly oily skin and had no need for such things. Getting ready to leave the house I remember my mother putting on face powder and lipstick when going out for the evening. She would also brush her hair quite vigorously. It was always permed and I noticed how long it was when she brushed it out. My father would shave and always used to smell nice. He would also use Brylcreem, to make his hair slick and shiny, which was the fashion then. In my early years in the civil service, women had to wear a dress or skirt for work. This didn’t bother me as it was the norm at that time. In the mid-80s I remember some of my lesbian friends seeing me dressed up for work one day and looking as though I was “in drag”. Fortunately, make-up wasn’t a requirement. I can’t remember when trousers were allowed, but it was a massive relief for me then. When socialising, I always wear jeans, and don’t feel pressurised to have lots of outfits. I have always loathed buying clothes. Although I am slim, I still find it difficult to find particularly tops that will suit me."

My husband is due back in about an hour and I need to post off part 1 as a matter of urgency (it mustn't be found).What does health mean to me?Being well and, generally, young. For years I took my health for granted, but now I notice that I am definitely slower and stiffer than I used to be.'Wellbeing' to me means more about a mental state of contentment and of everything being right in the world. As I cry most days now, I don't think that it is a state of mind that I currently have.When I imagine a healthy body, what do I imagine? The 1st 5 words I think of to describe this are:YOUNG, active, fit, sporty, fast.When I imagine a healthy body I imagine a young body. I also have a vision of a naked body, not in a sexual way, but because you can hide a lot up with clothes. Tall and blonde and female. Not skinny or fat, just naturally slim.I was blonde and in a way I imagine myself when I was young, before life wore me down and I was diagnosed with various medical conditions. If I had that body again and I was young, I would run and keep on running, until I was miles away from the life I have now.The only thing that I think influenced my own experience of health and wellbeing, was a determination to keep my body working. I remember thinking, in my teens, that if I started then, I could still be cycling or walking when I was in my 80s, although I couldn't ever imagine being old. Just because you can't imagine such things when you are young. My mother laid no importance on exercise and as she got older she became severely incapacitated. That, happening to me, is my biggest dread.All the buzz words you use (gender, ethnicity etc) were not analysed in the 1960s and 70s, so they were not a consideration then. Although I remember the School Nurse checking for nits and weighing us. I also remember naked showers at the grammar school. We were all visible to the teacher standing at the end. Nowadaysthat seems bizarre and perverted.and we all hated it, but nobody ever thought of complaining. People just accepted things then.When did I first become aware of health and wellbeing?It was very different when I was young. We naturally got more exercise, but things were not analysed in the way that they are now. 'Wellbeing' was not a word I remember being used, apart from in old textbooks.It's like most other things, you just did what your parents, or teachers, or other people in authority said, and got on with it.The other questions don't seem to apply to me. I never wore make up and neither did my mother. My parents didn't go out together in the evening and neither do I. My father used to give historical talks, but you don't dress up for that kind of thing.I suppose that when I was younger I liked going out and worried more about my appearance, but that is all a long time ago now. I just wear leggings and tops every day, but I do still walk for over 2 hours a day, most days. I am not giving up yet.Sorry this is so rushed. My husband has been away since Monday. He is due back and has bought me a hot water bottle. That is what I am supposed to be excited about now. Gone, the good body, the health and the freedom; the youthful expectation and dreams of eventual happy marriage and children.Hello instead, to the endless housework and the supposed joy of a new hot water bottle.Goodbye for today, my Mass Observation friends. I am crying again. What a state to get into. But you listen to me. My husband talks over me if I say anything and if I recommend anything, he deliberately doesn't do it, whatever it is. But you listen.You don't think I am nothing. Thank you."

B4290 Married, 51, Cambridgeshire, public sector.This response written March 2021 but mindful of the timings of the Directive.Part Two: Everyday Health and Wellbeing IdentityYes, 1 suspect my health has been influenced by my gender and ethnicity but also by the trends in medicine andthe constraints of the NHS (i.e., NICE guidelines have prevented doctors pursuing the real causes and treatments of illness and have kept them tethered to the murky world of Big Pharma).Growing up and learning about health and wellbeingPosters in school about dental health, leaflets in the clinic, school sports, reading in a picture book about how soap was 'a powerful germ killer', evening classes at a ballet school from 1975, Yoga classes from 1977 (class mascot). My parents were responsible for my health and wellbeing. My father was and is a great believer in the health benefits of walking. My mother neglected my health and general care in my early years and this was picked up on by the school dentist and at least one GP.I also learned about health by reading Yoga leaflets and books, NHS leaflets, teen magazines, library books, newspapers and monitoring how my body felt when I took exercise, or didn't.Key momentsMy puberty spanned ages 11 to 14. I didn't treat the events as rituals or terribly important, indeed, they added to the general faff of life at the beginning of the GCE O-Level courses.My mother disclosed details to others, which I did not appreciate and I made this known.Growing older1,	Since the age of five I've been as active as my health and work have allowed me to be. This has included bicycling since age six (from 1976 to the present day), ballet from age five to 14, Yoga from age seven to the present, walking/hiking as often as possible, and from earlier than I can remember, swimming. I'm waiting to get back into the water at time of writing, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Pools, rivers and the sea here in the UK: any of them would do right now. Information about health and wellbeing now comes from newspapers, books, the internet, posters and leaflets, health food shops, NHS Consultants and Functional Medicine practitioners, particularly the latter in recent years. I'm more aware of my body now but this is due to having to rely on it to get me to and from work If you choose not to run a car, you have to run your body instead, and run it as well as possible.Health, well-being and appearanceSkin, hair and over or under weight soon reflect poor health. I'm not too bothered about popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance if they relate to fashion, social media etc. I've enjoyed wearing even less make­ up this last year during the Covid lockdowns and am wearing less now that I am back at work, at a different job. Perhaps my parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals. There seemed to be a direct link between marriageability and personal grooming/looks amongst certain classes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly for women. A pleasant-looking doll to come home to? Modern social media may exert similar pressures, but I didn't feel that my marriage prospects or job prospects depended on these things myself.Desert Island health and wellbeing items:Bicycle, swimming costumes, Yoga mat and back roller, free weights, clean drinking water, a firm bed for sleep, walking and hiking boots and shoes, and a moisturiser from the health food shop.Getting ready to leave the house:I have more memories of my parents arriving home than leaving. Their work changed whilst I was growing up and so did their routines. Mine have changed likewise. Over time it has consisted of breakfast, showering, dressing, miscellaneous preparation such as bags, kit etc. Then cycling, walking, train, or a combination of all three. I made a personal promise not to buy a car of my own for as long as possible, to safeguard my health. I've kept this promise thus far at age 51. I'd like to cycle to work right up to my retirement, and beyond, if I can. The thought of having to drive to work does nothing for me and it will do nothing for my health either."

I don't think that my considerable experience of ill-health has been influenced by gender, (female) ethnicity, (Scottish,) social class (middle) or sexual orientation (straight female).We had no teaching about health, hygiene or sex at school in the early 1940's.    I first became aware of health when diagnosed at 16 with the nephrotic syndrome. I was very ill indeed for several years, my adolescence being spent lying in bed - there being no diuretics, blood pressure treatment or steroids in those early days. My parents, one a doctor and one a former ward sister, took a very gloomy view of mychances of surviving - as did the local consultant.Subsequently I had many more illnessesincluding cholecystit s, acute pancreatitis, T.I.A,1coronary thrombosis, iatrogenic focal dystonia and latterly several bouts of cellulitis. Post herpetic neuralgia has been a great trial. I don't think any of these were a result of anything save bad luck - but even so I have reached ninety - andhave survived a broken hip and osteoporosis in the last three years.    I can't remember having any rituals before going out except that even when attending a patient in the middle of the night my father always went out fully dressed, waistcoat and all.    I have though come to treat medical treatment with a certain amount of reserve and to make my own mind up about accepting it."

Identity – I grew up in a lower middle class home, an only child so my parents could afford to pay for health care in the early years of my life before the NHS. I have been lucky in that since the inception of the NHS I have been able to have free care. I fear that future generations may not have this to look forward to. Growing up -I first became aware of health problems in connection with a friend of my Mother’s. This lady had a son about a year older than me and he was frequently ill. I remember my Mother’s friend saying she did not know how they were going to pay the doctor’s bill. Seeing my grandmothers made me aware that old age brought with it a very restricted lifestyle. Neither of my parents found it easy to talk about feelings/emotions and I don’t remember them ever talking to me about health. I was a Brownie and later a Girl Guide and gained my Health badge in both groups – that was probably my source of information about healthy living. In the first year of secondary school we had lessons in human biology but when we reached the eagerly awaited chapter on “Reproduction” there was no sex education. Key moments – I was almost the youngest girl in my year at school and during compulsory showers after PE [ugh!] I noticed other girls’ bodies changing but this was not something we talked about even among ourselves. MY first period only occurred when I was 14 – my parents and I were staying with an aunt and uncle and my Mother was very apologetic to my aunt, who, having had a daughter of her own, was much more understanding; to my Mother it was something that “nice” people did not talk about. Had I had a daughter of my own I would have tried to be much more open about such things. Growing older – I have never been very good at any sport but I have enjoyed walking and learned to swim at the age of 40. I continued to swim regularly until I was 70 and less regularly for a while longer but my local pool is very cold and the changing rooms even colder so that I often got cramp – once there is no pleasure in going I stopped. During the lockdown H/2637 and still [in Tier 2 and now Tier 3] I try to take a walk every day. I have lost count of the number of crosswords, sudokus and code words I have done in an attempt to keep my brain active. I have a small health insurance and the company sends a magazine every couple of months – I do read that for information about health but otherwise I only pick information up from BBC TV or reading The Guardian. I would say I am definitely more aware of my body now than previously; I have fallen twice in the last year [my own fault each time, when I slipped on the stairs] The first time I woke the following morning in real pain and after going to see a GP was sent to have an X-ray at the hospital; the second time I only suffered a colourful bruise but I am now extra careful on stairs. I do not want to be hospitalised during the pandemic. I am aware that my health may take a downturn as I progress through my eighties. Appearance – People’s appearance is not always a guide to their health or well-being though how they take care of themselves is often an indication of their mental health. No, I am not influenced by “ideal” beauties and I am certain my parents would not have been. On my desert island I would certainly need high factor sunscreen. Leaving the house. When I was young my Mother would not have gone out to shop for instance without her coat, hat and gloves. Only once a year did my parents dress up -to go to the Ladies’ Evening at my Father’s Masonic Lodge. One way in which my routine has changed considerably changed during the past months is the need to check that I have a face mask and have “gelled” my hands if I am going into a shop."

I have not required any medical or professional help. During the last 8 weeks since I started self isolating I have been feeling mainly up beat and happy and have been enjoying the solitude and quietness. The Government I think that the decisions that the Government has been making over the past few weeks have been very difficult decisions to make. At times these decisions have not been perfect but I do believe that they have done their best in a very difficult situation. The Opposition has been mainly constructive and supportive of the decisions and any criticism has been moderate and helpful. We now seem to be reaching a stage, as restrictions are slowly being relaxed, when a certain amount of blame is being banded around for mistakes and slowness to react as everyone would wish. However hindsight is a wonderful thing and I do think it would be more productive to stop blaming each other and get on with the job in hand as there is still a long way to go. I expect the Government to slowly relax the rules on social distancing with a great deal of caution and as long as the R factor does not rise will continue to relax the rules and get the economy going as far as possible. News I always watch the Government’s Briefing in the afternoon and the BBCprogramwhich surrounds it. I rarely watch or listen to any other news broadcasts and do not read newspapers or engage with social media. Very occasionally I listen to World News ifI amawake in the night and can’t get back to sleep and also often will watch Nicola Sturgeons broadcast at noon. The daily 5 pm press conferences have been informative about data and numbers but frustrating in rarely answering the questions put by journalists and the public. I get the impression that whoever is leading the session has an agenda and is not willing to deviate from it. I much prefer the press conferences given by Nicola Sturgeon at noon as she is far more straight forward and transparent. I do not experience challenges to access of news, nor know anyone who does, but can see that this is a problem for some people. Certainly there should be signing and I assume subtitles are available but do not know if this is so. I also wonder how various ethnic minorities gather the news, especially if they do not have good English or do not generally watch and listen to the BBC news bulletins. I think this could possibly be an area that has been missed as it does not seem that access was uppermost in the mind as BSL interpreters are not even supplied. Work and Home life I no longer work as I am retired. However, I do see a few clients on a voluntary basis. Since the lock down I have not seen any. Some spiritual directors can work from a distance, by phone, email, skype etc, but I am not able to work this way so am not sure if my few clients will be coming back to me after lock down or not. That will be their decision. As I do not charge for my sessions I do not miss the money and as I only normally spend about an hour or so a week on sessions I does not materially affect me. I also have a spiritual director and a supervisor for this work and I am not able to see them either. Spring Directive Part 2: Covid 19 (Update) 0407 Female 80 Widow Filey Spiritual Director I do not have children living with me or anyone else so my home life remains much as it normally is apart from the fact that normally I would have visitors staying here about 50% of the time, that is family and/or friends. Sometimes strangers will come for a short stay for retreat/rest purposes and, of course, this is not happening now either. This has meant that I have more time for myself, which I appreciate, although I do miss the company a bit. However, it does mean there is less domestic work for me to do and I do seem to be spending more time gardening than usual. I do not see this period as a challenge but rather as an opportunity to refresh, meditate more, live at a slower pace and do exactly as I please whenever I want. I do not experience loneliness and have contact with friends and family by email and phone most days. Technology I am not very good with technology and try to avoid it. I did have to buy a new mobile phone as my old one, purchased in 1999, started to fail a bit. The new phone is a pay as you go and is not a smart phone so not unlike my original one. It did take me a while to get it going and get used to it but I am slowly getting there. My daughter in law would normally have set it up for me but I was left with doing it myself. I am not interested in social media and do not use it. I have had two family ‘zoom’sessions which while re-assuring to see family were also most frustrating, fragmented, and strangely depressing. If they arrange another session then I will probably join in or they will get worried about me but I don’t reallylike it. Shopping and food I normally shop for groceries on line and only one supermarket delivers in Filey so that is who I shop with. I shop on line because I would usually have a delivery just prior to receiving visitors, maybe twice a month, and then I need quite a lot and am not able to carry it, nor do I have a car. Since lock down my orders are smaller and mainly cheese, eggs, fresh fruit, vegetables and salads plus any cleaning requirements. Getting a slot for delivery was very difficult at first but is now quite a bit easier. Also I am never too sure what would be delivered as many items were not available in the early days of lock down so I often got nothing or substitutions which I always accepted, and at one point I could not get eggs for at least two weeks. At times this was frustrating and sometimes hilarious, for example ordering courgettes and getting a kilo of onions instead. Fortunately I am an experienced cook and managed to create something edible whatever was sent. In some ways this was challenging and I enjoyed that. I do not usually eat meat, bread, potatoes or milk unless I have visitors so have not been buying those items. Apart from that I am eating what I would normally eat and cook a main meal every day and also have a small snack at some point. The main meal would be rice/pasta with fish, eggs or cheese and a lot of greens or salad. Basically my eating habits have stayed the same as they would be when on my own. When I have visitors my eating habits are a bit different and would include meat and bread, alcohol – mostly red wine for me, and potatoes and I would eat later in the day. As I rarely drink alcohol on my own my consumption has dropped dramatically and I find that I do not miss it – I need good company to enjoy a drink. One very good change is that our local fishmonger is now delivering and accepting BACs payments, taking orders over the phone. As I eat so much fish and his fish is so fresh and delicious this is great for me. He also accepts rhubarb from me which helps to reduce the amount that I have growing in the garden. All deliveries of food have been observing the social boundary rules which is reassuring. Spring Directive Part 2: Covid 19 (Update) 0407 Female 80 Widow Filey Spiritual Director Entertainment and Leisure As I normally would be entertaining family and friends for 50 % of my time plus preparing bedrooms, meals, clearing and cleaning afterwards I found that I have quite a bit more time since lock down started. Strangely the time seems to be speeding up with less to do and the weeks are just flying past. I think this is mainly due to the fact that I must have slowed down quite a bit. At the start of the lock down I decided to take myself through an Ignatian retreat which would normally take about 4 weeks of meditation, undertaking various spiritual exercises, keeping a journal, reviewing my experience etc. I did undertake this and the whole process certainly helped to centre and slow me. Meditation also has the same effect. I have now finished that but am still meditating on a regular basis. In addition I have been working through several hundred letters that my father wrote to my mother between 1931 and 1951 which has been very absorbing and time consuming – another thing that I have now finished. Some household chores such as polishing all the old wooden floor boards throughout the house, quite heavy physical work, and hanging some pictures, and sorting out a years worth of filing have kept me busy. Also my large garden has needed plenty of attention over the last couple of months. I have not taken up any new hobbies, nor learned new skills or games but have managed to increase my walking early most mornings. I am regularly writing letters to my youngest granddaughter (aged 9) to which she writes back and we also email each other. The older grandchildren, six more aged 12 -30, also email from time to time along with my own five children and friends, and there are also the many phone calls to answer. As a family we have had a zoom session twice. With my eldest son we are jointly writing Haiku taking it in turns to write a line, via email. I watch about the same amount of TV as usual and generally in the evenings. Box sets, medical dramas, and sci-fi films are my choice. I am re-reading the Harry Potter series and have a new Stephen King novel waiting. I do not listen to the radio or music but do spend some time sitting in the garden listening to the birds singing and trying to identify them. Personal Hygiene No change there really except I am washing my hands more often. As my hair, normally kept quite short, is now growing and getting unruly I have bought some hair bands to keep it in place. The only other change is that I do wear my top clothes for more days than I would before although I do still change my underwear every day. Sleep I find that I am sleeping better than before, longer and deeper. This is because of the increased meditation and the more frequent walks I think. I always dream interesting dreams and remember my dreams for a while on awakening. If they seem of particular interest then I record them and spend some time thinking about what they are saying to me. The general trend of most of my dreams latelyhas to do with absorbing and grasping the content of myfather’s letters, as these letters have revealed more of my father than I previously realised and also have explained some of the family myths and secrets. None of them particularly disturbing but, of course, great interest and import to me. I have had the occasional dream about meeting family members. None of my dreams have been distressing."

In November 2019 we decided to move, to a smaller house and also to escape the noise of peacocks kept locally by a B+B. The woman from the solicitors told us to wait until early spring 2020 and put out house on the market then.At the start of February 2020 our house went on the market and we also began viewing houses ourselves. No one wore masks or social distanced then. By the end of February, on the same day, we sold our house and our bid was accepted for the house we wanted to move into. What an exciting day! We arranged to move at the start of April.Then Corona virus came and our buyers asked if they could change the moving date to a month later – no reason given. We said yes but shortly after that they pulled out of buying out house because the husband’s job was in jeopardy. So our house went on the market in April, on a Friday, and was sold again on the Monday. Then coronavirus really set in with lockdowns and nothing open and all we could do was wait and see what would happen. I wanted the house we’d agreed to buy so much that I was scared if I thought about it, it wouldn’t happen. So I tried to put it to the back of my mind, but it was hard. We were scared that the person whose house we wanted to buy would lose patience waiting, but she didn’t. Fortunately she wasn’t buying another house, just moving in with a friend, so she was OK about waiting for our house to be sold. Then in May our solicitor got back in touch with us and the move was on for mid June. With all the waiting and delays and setbacks I didn’t count on anything until we actually moved. It wasn’t helped by the fact that our new buyers were from Glasgow and the woman was 8 months pregnant – anything could have happened. But luckily, fortunately, the move did go ahead on the 19th June. I still can’t believe we’re in this lovely house. So Covid, for me, will always be about six months of waiting, uncertainty, worrying, hoping. The relief and lessening of tension when we finally moved was huge!Rhythm and routine of the day – lockdown was unreal at first. All the things you took for granted had just gone. What we used to do was to still get up between 7 and 8am – just like pre-lockdown. After breakfast we’d go our daily walk – usually along the beach. We’d come back, so any food prep for tea or a bit of housework then have lunch. In the afternoon we’d go on our computers or [iPad] or play a game. Because most of our things were packed up and in storage for the move, we brought some [Triominoes] from Amazon, I also did crosswords and sudokus. We ate our tea about 5pm and watch a bit of TV later. Then I would got to bed and read and [L] usually stayed up and watched TV series I wouldn’t watch – spacey things. If it was nice we’d go into the garden in the afternoon – our neighbours often heard us mixing up [Triominoes] on a large tray when we played it outside. We often met the same people on our walks – friends of ours in couples or on their own. I missed having coffees out, and going for care runs in the country, A tapestry that I’d hardly begun, and had sat around for years was amazingly finished in less than a month. It’s away being made into a cushion just now. I sent in a photo of it with the Spring directive. Fortunately when we were in lockdown the weather was dry and sunny and we went into the garden a lot. We spoke to friends/family on the phone, Whats App or text, [L] and I tried to keep to some sort of W729routine each day – I think it would have been easy to get up late and have no shape to each day. We tried to eat at the same times each day as we did pre lockdown, and fit what we did around our meals. I missed meeting up with friends and relatives, volunteering in the charity shop, walking to our local shops. We’d been going to go to Shetland for 10 days holiday in May and obviously that was cancelled – but hopefully we’ll get there next year. We were very lucky we’d gone to New Zealand on a house swap and also to stay with a friend, in autumn 2019 before all this began – it would have been a nightmare to try to reorganise it. So we came to the Corona Virus feeling quite energised after out travels late last year, which probably helped. I think the only solution for dealing with this virus is vaccination – but probably that won’t be anytime soon. I have registered with NHS Scotland for any trials of vaccines. Lots of our friends had multiple holidays booked abroad and these have all been cancelled. The most [recent] were A + J who were due to drive to the south of France in late August for 3 eeks in a post campsite – Canvas Holidays I think. They cancelled last week and are now going to the Isle of Wight for a few days in a B+B. Don’t know what they are doing about getting any money back. I suppose, for L and I, it is as good a year to move house as any because what else would we have done with everything on hold?I kept in touch a lot on WhatsApp with the friend we’d visited in NZ at the end of last year. Their government, in my opinion, took a much more sensible approach to Coronavirus than the UK’s did, starting off with limiting flights to NZ. Why the government here still let flights in the UK with no checks is beyond me. The NZ government seemed to implement track and trace bettwe, and also quarantine.Fortunately, in February, before lockdown, I had my hair cut (before going to a nephew’s wedding in the Scottish borders in late February) and also a routine dental checkup, Since coronavirus I have been extra careful of my teeth (no caramels or nuts or anything that might [poke] fillings out or break bits of teeth off) because seemingly dental appointments at the school of dentistry in Dundee are for dire emergencies only – not stupid accidents. I don’t know when dental checkups will start again. Since lockdown was lifted I’ve had my hair cut and have made another appointment for November – hopefully before any second coronavirus wave happens. I never normally make hair appointments that far in advance. At the start there were queues outside all the supermarkets here, but as time had passed the queues have disappeared and people just seem to use supermarkets as normal now. L and used to take turns, week about, queueing at Sainsbury’s on a Sunday morning and doing a big shop. We have a small local M+S and there were always queues outside. Even now there are sometimes queues there. The most I’ve had to wait was about half an hour outside Sainsburys one Sunday morning. What else can you do? You just have to do it – everyone is in the same boat.We’ve had lots of people down to see our new house – one of them shielded until the end of July and we were his and his wife’s first outing from their house in Angus. Another friend lives locally and we saw her in out garden at our old house then she came into our new house but we tried to socially distance inside as much as possible.I’m sure viruses like this will happen again in the future (although hopefully not in my life time again) and I just hope lessons worldwide have been learned from this outbreak. I look upon 2020 as a sort of lost or wasted year (even though we did most things apart from go on holiday) and it’s still not over because there is no way to deal with this virus."

I was eventually given my first dose of the new drug Penicillin When I became ill again with Tonsillitis the following year.D:::iina 1 nf  C:H26392	H2639I frequently had sore throats and each time this happened, the doctors would tell my parents	that I should have my tonsils removed. However they never did anything about the situation, and at the age of 80 I still have my Tonsils and I still get sore throats from time to time! I can also remember having measles just after my brother was born	and when I was 11 I had a awful bout of mumps which was extremely painful. Of course in	those days of the 1940's, people did not run to the doctors quite so frequently because the N.H.S had only just come into existence. and people thought they may have to pay for treatment.     I can quite clearly remember a 'pandemic'	similar to what is happening at the present time. This was called ASIAN FLU and it happened in 1957, many, many people were affected by it. I caught it in September and spent my 17th birthday in bed seriously ill.  It took me over 3 weeks to really recover and go back to work. (I was serving an Apprenticeship as a trainee Baker) which was quite a hard physical occupation.Then when I was i8 I was vaccinated against Poliowhich was such a threat when I was young.  My brother who is six yearsyounger had been vaccinated at school but because I was already workingI had to go to our local Doctors practice to receive my dose.	I think that my mother did not really understand the importance of food to improve health & wellbeing. She did not like cooking, it was just something she had to do to keep the family going. And she certainly did not read any books To improve her knowledge	about vitamins.	We were a working class family so there was not a lot of money to spend on food , and because of food rationing , what food we had was very stodgy.        I cannot remember having any health talks from my mother until I became a teenager and she told me what would happen when I started my periods.	When I eventually went to senior school we than hadinformation about vitamins	etc. during our Domestic Science Lessonsand the type of food	which constituted a balanced meal. It was only when I had to stay for school dinners (because it was too far away from my home to go home for Lunch) that I began to realise how certain foods should taste. I really loved my school meals. They seemed perfect after my mother's cooking!		This is when I	felt that I	could cook food to the way I wanted it to tasteMost food was still rationed when I was a teenager and it was only inthe later 1950's that food finally came of rationing.	Food became moreplentiful but my mother's cooking did not improve!        It was shortly after I started at Senior School that my periods began. I hated having to deal with this problem as well as beginning a new school.	I always used to have very painful periods so invariably I had to stay at home for the first day or go to school and be sent to the sick bay till the worst of the pain subsided.	This problem did not resolve until I was 30 and gave birth to my daughter!D:::1na ') r.f C:H26393	H2639Just before my 21st birthday I was admitted to our local hospital with suspected Appendicitis, I had not felt	well for several weeks and I thought that it was because I was doing a rather physical job. However the doctors were correct and my appendix was removed. I was in hospital for two weeks , one week in the main hospital and one week in the attached convalescent  home. (That routine at that date)This experience took me several months to recover from,  before Ifelt	'normal'  again.	This was my first experience of being in an hospitalGROWING OLDERI	felt that my health became much better after I married. I lived in much better surroundings and	had much better meals.	My husband was so pleased that I could cook so well, and make such attractive food.     We also lived not far from the coast at Felixstowe and because my husband already had a car when we married we would take every spare moment ...to go down to the coast and have a walk in the sea air.      He needed a car because he was affected by the long term effects of Polio, which he caught in 1952 before the vaccine came into being.    We tried to get out into the fresh air as much as possible and we also spent the first two years of our marriage creating a garden at the back and front of our house. I have always like swimming and tried to dothis as much as possible. I I also liked walking	in the fresh air so I would often walk from our house into the town centre, this took	about 20/25 minutes depending which route I took. If I had done some shopping I would come home on the local bus which went past our house or I would arrange for my husband to pick me up at a given time and place. (No mobile phones in those days!)	Because I read a lot of books about nutrition (which I still do) I have always tried to provide the best combination of	food for our meals.     I must have done something right because my husband lived to be 86years. Sadly he died in July this year from the combination of Prostate Cancer and the long term effects of Polio    I celebrated my 80 birthday in September.	Both my husband and I have lived longer than either our parents or all of our my grandparents. When our daughter was a teenager. My husband and I decided that perhaps  we could start travelling and we started having coach holidays in Europe, we really enjoyed these and we were able to see many places that we had only dreamt about. We went to visit friends in Holland, we explored France by coach, we had a coach holiday to Italy and fell completely in love with the country, so spent many hours on consequent holidays exploring many areas of Italy. This did us both a lot of good because of the lovely weather we always encountered. And the interesting places we visited. On one holiday we visited Siena and this had always been a long held wish of my husbandH26394	H2639.   Unfortunately we had to stop these holidays in 2000, because as my husband, aged the long term effects of Polio began to affect him, and he had to start using a wheelchair because his ability to walk any distance deteriorated . We could still travel in England were we could drive ourselves ( I learnt to drive the first year of our marriage)     I have always tried to be outside at least some part of the day, even if it is only a walk up to our local shops or post office or pottering in the garden.	I also like to still swim as long as the swimming pool is warm.     Nowadays	I have to be more careful about what I do and where I go because in 1994 because much to my horror I was diagnosed with Angina.	This despite never smoking or drinking, exercising		and eating the	right foods. I	have	never had a heart attack but have to live with special drugs. To relieve the pain and discomfort from the Angina. I have been admitted to our	Ipswich hospital on several occasions with Angina attacks and I have had treatment at	the famous Papwoth hospital in Cambridge. Which I consider my self very fortunate	to receive. There is a history of Heart problems in our family, both my parents died of Heart conditions and my only brother has also had heart problems.	I thought I had done everything to avoid this. If it is in your genes you cannot do anything about it    I am much more aware of my body now and have to consider how many tasks I	am going to achieve in one day. Life has become slightly easier since my husband died because I was trying to nurse him at home with the help of 'Carers'	but sadly he had to be admitted to the local hospice for the last few weeks of his life.	The Covid situation made matters worse, because our daughter and I	could not see him as frequently as we wished when he was in the Hospice       Several weeks after my husband's death I was taken into hospital again. However this was not an Angina attack.	I was in excruciating pain by the time the paramedics arrived and eventually I was diagnosedwith Pancreaitis	caused by Gall Stones. As a result of this, I	had to have an operation to have my Gall bladder removed. I now feel that I am finally recovering from this surgery.	Matters were made worse because none of my friends could come and visit, when I came home from the hospital	because of the first period of 'Lockdown'	I had lots of lovely cards and letters but it is not the same as actually seeing people face to face. I now have to realise that I am ageing	(In my head I am still 35) And have to consider what I do and where I go. I can still drive so I have still got my independence and I have a very helpful daughter and son-in­ law. I get my information about health matters from newspapers and magazines I hope I can live for approx another ten years to see my two lovely grandchildren enter on to their chosen careersD::.na LI. r.f  C:H26395	h2639HEALTH, WELLBEING AND APPEARANCE. I	like to feel that my appearance is important, I have my hair regularly cut in a modern bob and I have always tried to take care of my skin. It makes me feel better in health if I know I look good .	My hair is due to be trimmed in the next two days	because I had to cancel my last appointment because I was in hospital. I make some of my own clothes and can alter bought ones to fit correctly.	My appearance has always been important in a way, Not to show off, but to make me feel well.When I was a teenager I could not have the clothes I wanted to wear because of clothing rationing and because my mother bought all my clothes.	When I started working I finally had some small amounts of money to spend on myself. I	have never copied a particular trend or celebrity in my choice of clothes. I have always worn the clothes that were made out of the materials I liked. Sadly I cannot buy the materials I used to do because there are no material shops in Ipswich,. they have all closed.		I have to go to Norwich or Cambridge for lovely fabrics.     Even that is not possible	at the moment	because of the Covid lockdown !	I hope that we shall return to a 'normal life' next year .I shall certainly be glad to see the back of this year.It will seem very sad for me to celebrate	Christmas this year because This will be the first Christmas I have not spent with my husband in 55years.!  We actually met at Christmas 1965D na C: nf	C:"

It is difficult to really isolate ourselves because we have to have so many visitors to our house. We have 'Carers'	twice a day to attend to my husband and also a district Nurse is coming weekly to dress my husband's sore ankles (bedsores)   My cleaner who is very good and lives locally, comes for two and a half hours every week to help me with the heavy housework. I also suffer from Angina, but at the moment I am managing to cope with	the extra stress and worry of my husband.    I also have to shop for	essentials like hand wipes and flushable toilet wipes and also collect and deposit prescription requests at our local pharmacy.	We also have a gardener visit every two weeks because I cannot do the heavy work in a our garden.	Over the last two years I had started using Internet shopping for groceries. (Thanks to tuition from my marvellous son-in-law)		However the last time I tried to place an order approx two weeks ago, half way through my list I was told that they had deleted the goods I had already ordered because I had taken too long! So I had to go to the supermarket in person and physically buy the goods I needed.	If they do the same again how is that going to help me stay isolated?	I need to have some shopping delivered, because of osteo-arthritis	I cannot lift heavy bags or parcels.  Our daughter  & son-in-law and grandchildren live-on the other side of Ipswich and they help as much as they can, but both adults are working.  Our daughter is a highly trained nurse in the local hospital and our son-in-law is an Electronics expert and our two lovely grandchildren		have outside interests that they need to be taken too in their spare time. Therefore	I cannot always get their help when I most need it. In the last few days I have only been to local shops to get fresh eggs, milk, vegetables	& breadmaking	flour. ( I have made my own bread for years)	But friends have told me about the empty shelves in the supermarkets. My husband's carer was telling me yesterday she had great difficulty in purchasing some meat to make a meal with. I have meat and fish in my freezer but my worry is when it is all used will I be able to replace it?	I also have a fairly well stocked pantry, how long will those goods last if I cannot replace them?	Any shopping takes twice as long as it used to do, because of all the queueing I have to do; even our local Pharmacy is making people queue by only admitting one person at a time into the shop.      In a way we have been self	isolating	for the last four years, because my husband cannot stand or walk anymore	due to the long term effects of Polio, and I cannot get him into our car any longer. In the last four years		If he has a hospital appointment we have to book a wheelchair accessible taxi to get him there and back again,	we have not had a meal in a restaurant, or been to the theatre. or the cinema, during this period. He can only go into our garden if the 'Carers' come and hoist him into his wheelchair and take him outside.I cannot lift or move him anymore.2	H236 However the Coronavirus has meant that friends and family cannot come and visit us.		I really	miss seeing our lovely grandchildren ( A boy of 15 and his sister who is 11).	We have only been able to see and talk to them via	the phone.	My daughter tells me that our grandson is like a caged lion, because he cannot go and play football for his team and he cannot even have friends round to kick a ball round their garden . He was also due to take his O Levels	this spring, so no one knows what is going to happen		at the present time.			I have not been to my Women's Institute meetings for two months, because they have been closed until the situation  clears. WE have a book reading group within our W.I and I really miss that very much.	I have also been unable to attend our Methodist	church due in part to looking after my husband and now because of the Virus situation..One of our worries is that our daughter could catch the virus in the hospital during her working day, we have been reading the newspapers and listening to the news	and we realised how many medical staff are being affected with the virus.        It amazes my husband and I, how quickly the virus seems to have spread across the world! I suppose that is one of the drawbacks of the modern era that people can travel to foreign countries so easily. When I was a child I never ever thought that I would have foreign holidays.	My husband and I have only been to European countries , we have never visited Asia .America or Australia. It seems incredible that a small town in China can create such havoc In such a short length of time!Since I began to write this directive about the Coronavirus my husband's	condition had deteriorated	still further, he is now confined to bed.	A recent bone scan showed	that the cancer is spreading quite rapidly to his bones and particularly to his spine, and this is affecting his bowels. We have had to have more visits from District Nurses, Doctors , Occupationai Therapists etc. It was finally decided to admit him to our local hospice here in Ipswich		I have been trying to keep up with news via Newspapers and Television but as you will appreciate I have to give my husband more attention than ever!At this time	(April  28th	I have just had to	see my husband  put into an Ambulance)and taken off to our local hospital because he needs treatment that cannot be done at home) I have also had a phone call from our daughter to say that she has seen him	in theAccident & Emergency	Dept  and they are going  to test him for the  Coronavirus,So of course ,if the test proves positive we shall have to go into really strict quarantine The whole family) our daughter may not be allowed to	work in the hospital until the results arrive.	What I think is so peculiar about this virus, is the wide range of ages that it is affecting , babies are dying of it when they are only a few days old, and yet a lady of 106 has actually survived and was shown leaving the hospital in a wheelchair. It is also tragic, that people who have Medical training, have come out of retirement to help the situation, and in a brief time they are dead from the Virus!3	H2639    I also cannot believe, that supposedly one of	the  most important man in public life, the President of the U.S.A. is making such ridiculous		statements as telling people the should think about injecting them selves with disinfectant to kill the virus. Don't the American people realise how discreditable he is?.I am now wring this page On Sunday May the 10th 2020, my husband is now terminally ill and	was taken yesterday, into our local Hospice here in Ipswich, for end of Life care.Our daughter and I are taking it in turns to be with him, because of the Corona virus. only one member of the family can be with a patient at any time, because the medical staff do not want too many people walking round the Hospice at this period of high infection. I feel so distressed that the whole family cannot be with him at this time!	My husband has always tried to live a 'Normal ' life despite being disabled and it is so heartbreaking to see this proud independent man totally helpless and unable to do anything for himself!	Our daughter and I take it in turns to be there at meal times so that we can feed him, to take what little work we can do off the nurses and care workers.	I am also having to do more work in the house than I have done for several years, because our regular cleaner has been told that she cannot go into different houses in case they bring the Covid 19 into each individual, She is employed by Age UK and they have suspended their Home Help service for the present time. I also feel sorry for her as well as myself, because she is not being paid for her marvellous help with us and other customers in the same circumstances.          As you will see by our ages we have been retired for many years, so the problem of going to work is of no consequence!		However it has made a difference to our social life because friends and family would come over to see us because my husband could not go to see them. And of course all this visiting had to stop once the Covid 19	appeared	on the scene.	It has also become worse for me to see this man who I have been married to for 52years and who I love dearly,	deteriorate day by day in front of my eyes.	It has also made our house more uncomfortable when we need most comfort because of all the Medical equipment and devices he needed to be cared for at home. e.g Electric Hospital bed two different types of hoist to move him		form bed to chair. Eventually he was confined to bed because he was so fragile.	It has also affected when I can, and cannot go out of the house because of having to wait for a Nurse or Doctors visit.	When appointments are made they can only say it will be morning or afternoon because they are such busy people, and therefore I have to wait until they actually appear.		We are so fortunate to have the NHS becausethe care and attention my husband has received and is still receiving	is faultless.       I think this' clapping for Carer's is rather a nonsense!. Something much more practical would be to give the Medical staff trying to cope with this Pandemic a decent pay rise and the correct PPE equipment to prevent them selves being affected. You only have to read a daily paper	to see how many valuable staff have died with the Virus. It seems the height of nonsense to order PPE equipment from China & Turkey and find they are not suitable, why in heaven's name are we not manufacturing	our own . Why did not the politicians think of this when we were first hit by the virus?	In fact why are we actually buying any goods from China? When we do it often falls apart after a very brief time . I always try and buy British if I am purchasing any thing for the house.       I feel that shops like M & S have lost their superiority because it's the most English Dept/ store yet nothing is now made in England!	Why are we not employing our own people4	H2639 and get them to make some	Gowns & masks.	I think the Government should have imposed lockdown at an	earlier stage of the Virus appearance.	Perhaps there would not have been so many deaths. Particularly in so many care homes. Don't elderly people count for anything now? My personal hygiene has not altered all.	Why would I not want to be clean and attractive?. The only problem I am finding at the moment is getting my hair cut		(I have short hair in a 'bob') and my hairdresser comes	to the house and	does my hair and also cuts my husband's hair because he cannot get to a barbers any more.	My hair is now much longer than I normally	wear it but until the government gives hairdressers permission to do their work again	it will have to stay like that.     I am never short of occupying my self - If I have books to read and music to listen too, I think my entertainment is complete . in this warm weather I also like gardening and also sewing and of course I still have to do housework to keep my house clean and at the present time I am spending many hours at the hospice with my husband,.	Of course writing M-0 directives	is another great occupation !	Both my husband and myself have missed doing things together. When we began our retirement it was lovely to be able to shut the front door on any dust, get into the car and drive down to the coast at Felixstowe or Aldeburgh have a walk along the promenade and then have a pub lunch or take a picnic with us, andspend the day in the sunshine and fresh air.	As my husband became more disabled from the long term effects of Polio these outing became more and more infrequent,  due to the problems of finding Disabled toilets or buildings that were in accessible for wheelchairs ..      I am old enough to remember the dreadful ASIAN FLU	in 1957	I spent my 17th birthday in bed in Sept 1957 being extremely  ill with this virus. However I don't think the country went to such extreme measures as the country is doing with Covid 19.      I wonder if anyone will find a Vaccine for it?	Look how long it took to invent a vaccine against Polio!-	/"

Male, 77, widower (now having a partner), retired civil servant, Cardiff.COVID19 (Update)I have not previously commented, so this not so much of an update as an initial report. I have been particularly careful not to unwittingly give away my identity by giving too much personal details, while writing this report. Thus a few significant matters have been omitted all together.I will refer to my partner as P; she and I live in separate homes.HealthI am on various routine tablets, such as statins, blood pressure. I have need a repeat prescription a couple of weeks ago, and obtained it without problem. I did need a blood test in advance of an upcoming (telephone) consultation which was done at a local hospital. Social distancing was observed of course, my temperature was taken and I was asked various questions regarding my health and those of anyone who lived with me. I wore a mask, as did the staff of course.A short while after lockdown I fractured one of my front teeth, but still hanging on (by a thread?). On phoning the dentist I discovered that all dentists are closed! I was able to speak to the dentist who was working from home. He was able to access my records and assure me that it would be OK, but I should wash my mouth daily with a branded mouth wash.A consultation with my financial advisor was done over the phone.The GovernmentThis perhaps the best place to comment on the Welsh First Minister's introduction of the Welsh Road Map, introduced at a daily briefing. As an introduction it was fine, but it gave no details of the said Map. It comprised three zones - red, amber and green; we apparently are near the read zone. This confusingly is different to the situation in England which has five zones, the red of which was when the virus was rampant before lockdown. Then apparently the zone boundaries are not rigid and some features might 'migrate' from one zone to another. No mention was made as to how to access the Plan, a 20 page document. P did manage to find a press briefing on line, which gave an outline of the Plan. All in all I was confused and disappointed.I get the impression that the UK government are reacting to events, rather than being pro-active, also to shifting their ground. I have not kept a record of what precisely, but the following is an example. Early on we were shown a graph showing a peak of deaths followed by one or two subsequent inevitable peaks. A crucial aim we were told was to ensure the following peaks were as small as possible. Now we are told that a second peak must be avoided at all costs. Further, the government made a commitment that certain year groups of primary school children would return on 1 June. After a huge national fuss as to whether it is safe to do so, they are now back tracking, saying there was always flexibility in their plans.It all goes to show that lockdown across the whole of society was easy; getting it start will be no easy matter; each sector will raise its own problems, eg transport.NewsRather that go out each day for The Daily Telegraph I have been having it delivered­ delivered free for 6 weeks. I largely rely on the paper for my main source of news.First thing in the morning I listen to the Today programme coverage, and then some of the BBC Breakfast programme (not a regular before), before starting the paper. Later I watch the J o'clock and 6 o'clock News bulletins as I usually do. I quite often find the reports depressing; and why do we need to know death tolls in Spain, Italy and India? (Maybe because there are so many of their nationals living here?) I sometimes watch the daily 5pm briefings, and also the Welsh which come on at 12.30pm. They vary greatly information-wise, sometimes they are not up to much and I switch off.The excellent detailed reports of the easing of the lockdown in England do not apply here in Wales; once it does start to ease here in Wales I doubt it will have such good coverage.A few days after writing the previous sentence the Welsh First Minister at the daily press briefing announced the Welsh Road Map. This was not reported in the national newspaper.Work and home life.As retirees, P and I have of course not been working. My daughter, who lives 30 minutes drive away was furloughed for a few weeks, but is back to work now; her partner works in the community and thus is at risk.The greatest impact on home life arises from the situation of P and me not living together. Prior to lockdown our lives were very closely integrated, such that we spent much of every day together - shopping, watching TV, car trips, visiting friends, weekends away, voluntary work, sleeping over. All this has had to stop. The best we have been able to do, is to coordinate daily walks keeping 2 metres apart, sometimes sitting for a while, so that we have at most an hour together - thus far the weather has been good and dry. The only physical contact we have is touching finger tips through gloved hands! This separation has been hard to bear, with little prospect of significant change for a while. We do of course spend a fair while each day on the phone, but it is not the same.      *   There is some hope at last: today (18/5) it is reported that the Welsh Administration is actively considering the question of family and friends being able to meet (outdoors).TechnologyI keep in touch with P and my children using the land lines and mobile phones. P and I speak several times a day. I have now downloaded AhatsApp which has certain advantages. I phone other family, friends and former colleagues from time to time as it occurs to me.Apart from the newspaper and TV bulletins, I also look at the BBC News App now and again. I can also search the net on my mobile.Shopping and foodP shops for both of us just once a week; I dictate a list the evening before. The list is fairly standard, but rarely used items crop up now and again. What we miss I suppose are the serendipitous things that catch the eye in passing. To that extent shopping is a bit predictable, so that my freezer is biased to chicken breasts and fish (of several varieties though). That said I look out for recipes in the weekend papers, and have extended my range a bit, without buying special ingredients I am never likely to use again. I try to eat a good supply of fresh vegetables, with frozen as a stand-by. I still*1/6 at last we can meet in each other’s gardens, under pergolas (it rained for almost the first time today (3/6) in weeks. We have taken advantage (tea, coffee, lunch): it makes so much difference.eat a plentiful supply of fruit - fresh and tinned - primarily at breakfast, but generally some at lunch time and at dinner time.I generally still have an alcoholic every day; now the summer is here generally beer, but that is some times non-alcoholic, so my units is less than previously.Entertainment and leisureMy leisure has not changed significantly. I watch rather more TV - in addition to antiques programmes, there are some really good travel programmes. I am not mad keen on Tony Robinson, but like Michael Portillo (but then he went to the same schools as me!) Over recent years I have weeded out a great deal of the paper back fiction I had, so I am a bit bereft of reading material. I have several volumes of Michael Palin's travelogues which I have started to read, along with a couple by Paul Theroux. I am currently (re?)reading The hunchback of Notre Dame, which I was give as a Christmas present when I was 14!I have done a few DIY jobs but do not wish to go out a queue at B & Q for hours - Iguess like supermarkets they are out of popular items like white paint!I have a reasonable sized garden which I try to keep tidy and useful. Its main problem is extensive weed and moss in the lawn; I try every year to deal with it but am always defeated. In all this fine weather I have been fairly active in the garden, in particular reviving a small vegetable patch.Personal hygieneI shower most days still (extensive washing if not), usually before 7 o'clock. I then shave. I normally use a pre-electric that Boots sell, but I am out of it and haven't replaced it; likewise my favourite after shave. I don't get such a good shave, but having to keeping a social distance from P it is not a problem! But I still use under­ arm deodorant. I have never grown a beard or moustache, and even though P is not keen I thought I'd have a go at a moustache for a few weeks; but it was like straw growing out of my face and was dark on one side and light on the other, so I shaved it off after two weeks.I have managed to cut my hair with electric clippers. P reckons it looks quite good. My washing machine packed up a day or two - as it happens - just before lockdown. A new one was delivered, but there was no time to fir it or remove the old one. So P does almost all my washing - Bless her.SleepMy usual sleep pattern is as follows: bed just after 10, woken by my bladder at 2, read or play codewords (a sort of crossword without clues) for a bit, hopefully this gets me through till 6ish with sometimes another bathroom visit; now and again my bladder plays up all night. I dream occasionally.Nowadays this pattern is quite disturbed. I quite often find it difficult to get to sleep, or worse still wake before midnight sitting up in bed with my glasses on and the light still on. It is then very difficult to get back to sleep again. I often wake at 4ish finding it difficult to get back to sleep or decide to read or not, or turn the radio on quietly. I dream quite a bit now, with the dreams often being mildly disturbing. P also finds her sleep pattern disturbed along similar lines to my own."

Aged 70. Retired Social Worker. Widow.  Living in Bristol. Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2 : Everyday Health and Wellbeing… Health. Good health means having no physical problems or long term ongoing conditions which interfere with your functioning and life style. Wellbeing This is different , it is more an internal state. Good health can contribute to one's wellbeing, but it is not the entire picture. Wellbeing is dependent on how one perceives the outside world from one's own inner perspective. In my opinion wellbeing is more to do with mental health-thus one could have a sense of wellbeing inspite of being in poor health, and vice-versa. A healthy body. Fit, strong, hardy, painfree, energetic. I see this as a young person who takes the efficient working of their body for granted. Identity I do not think that my experience of health has been influenced by my gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. I believe education has been more influential in that I know about the conditions which I have  and when to take action. I admit that social class might be a beneficial factor as I  have the confidence to ask for help and to complain if necessary. Also my health would probably be worse if I had grown up in poor conditions. Wellbeing is slightly different. I am lucky to have come from a stable background and have been loved and encouraged by my family.  This has been helped by lack of poverty in my childhood , and a good education , job etc., all of which have contributed to my sense of personal satisfaction and therefore well being. Inspite of many difficulties in my private life I would say that I have been largely content with my lot, and have usually had a sense of wellbeing. I have been lucky to have many good friends and plenty of interests, and a lovely family. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing. I was aware of health issues quite young  because I had two spells in hospital with pneumonia and pleurisy when I was aged 7 and 8. Each time I spent about a month away from home, and could only see my Mother very occasionally. This was hard. I was frightened when I was taken away in the ambulance and I remember the feel and smell of the red blanket. D826 I knew I was ill. I knew the other children in my class were at school but I couldn't go, and so I felt left behind. Later I had chronic excema which accentuated my sense of difference. I was used to having trouble with breathing and with itching. My parents, particularly my Mother, were responsible for my health. They did not really talk about it with me, but loved and cared for me so it minimized what I was experiencing. I remember two incidents which contributed to my sense of wellbeing. My Father would come in my bedroom when he came  home from work, from time to time he would bring me a puffin book which was wonderful. Reading was, and has continued to be, a great solace. Another memory is that of my best friend's Mother coming to see me – we looked at every picure in the Observer book of Dogs and she talked about each breed to me. I watched my Mother take pleasure from tending her garden and indoor plants, and from actively caring for me and my Father. Her life was not easy, but she made the best of  it, something I have always tried to do. This has definitely contributedto my sense of well being , and influenced me to realise that money is not everything. I do not remember any conversations about health at school. I leaned about it from my own personal experiences. Key Moments. I did not reach puberty until I was about 15, and this was a great source of distress for me, because it accentuated my sense of difference to my friends again. Later my Mother told me that she consulted the GP about the delay, who told her not to worry, but I did not know this at the time. I hated having a flat chest, but when it did develop it was a good size. I don't remember growing pubic hair. I have no memory of buying my first bra, but I'm sure my mother helped me. My Mother was excellent , she explained everything that would happen, and prepared sanitary equipment in the form of the hideous sanitary towels and belt. I was not bothered about this, and have no memory of when it finally did happen. She never made a fuss about it herself. However, I recall that she was very worried about my desire to use Tampax, and I had to buy some myself when I was a bit older , and try it out. I was very relieved when I got to be like everyone else. Growing Older Once I recovered from my childhood ill-health I learned how to live with excema which has lurked about for the rest of my life. I just accept that I have flare ups from time to time, and I have had to use moisturising creams  and ointments  all the time. This is ok, there are a lot of conditions far worse. Similarly I have lived with respiratory problems most of my life as a result of my childhood illnesses. So I have frequently suffered from chest infections , breathlessness etc, but this has been controlled with antibiotics and inhalers. This has not seriously impinged on my life , I am  just used to it. Until my husband died I was relieved of my anxiety about my health because he was a GP. He D826 would always tell me if I needed to go to my own GP ( not often!). However, since then I have worried far more about myself and my health, and particularly since the pandemic. I have consulted GP more about various minor issues since I have been alone, and I sometimes look on NHS website about medical matters. In addition there is the factor of age. I have friends who are developing cancer, having strokes , and other life altering conditions. This is certainly making me much more aware of my body. I know that I have to accept that my body is beginning to wear out, but as yet I am pretty fit. Although I would prefer to ignore some of my symptoms, I realise that I have to be sensible for the sake of my children. I do not want to burden them. However, the prospect of increasing deterioration is not very positive. I eat properly, go out for a walk daily, and do pilates to keep supple. I try to sleep well-I never had a problem with this until my husband died, and was just recovering my sleep pattern when the pandemic interfered with it again. However, I have always tried not to worry about lack of sleep, and just read if I have insomnia. Health, wellbeing and appearance. I have never really been influenced by popular ideas of beauty and physical appearance. I like to think I have my own style-I do not wear make-up , nor do I dye my hair, but I am interested in clothes and how I look. When young I conformed to the fashion of mini-sirts, mascara etc etc, , but I was not very worried about how I looked. However , in retrospect, looking at old photos, I looked much better than I thought. I can understand how young women suffer self body distortion. Health and wellbeing are related to physical appearance, and I am more sensitive to this as I age. It is hard to look and feel good if you are in pain or depressed. I admire people who make the effort to dress nicely and put on “ a brave front” inspite of their own problems, whether mental or physical. Of course a person's spirit and personality will still be there inspite of their appearance, and one should not be biased and put off by an unattractive or disfigured face and body. A benefit of age is that one has the confidence to portray oneself as one wants without worrying about what others think . The pandemic has not been helpful in terms of the morale building which results from looking nice to go out . I have worn the same uniform of jeans and jumper/t-shirt for nearly a year. There have been no occasions to warrant dressing up-though I have just forgotten my 70th birthday in October 20 when I put on a DRESS to go to my daughter's house for a celebratory meal ( I'm in a bubble with them). Also I put festive clothing on for Christmas Day. Other than those times I haven't been in any other house or doing anything except walking, so no point . I am looking forward to wearing some of my other clothes which will defintely boost my sense of wellbeing. In conclusion , wellbeing is very much a state of mind. It involves acceptance of one's circumstances and trying to be positive about life. There is always something to be thankful for and I try to maintain this approach."

Living in Bristol . Retired Social Worker Mass-Observation Spring Directive 2020 Part 2 Covid Health Physical problems: I had a sore throat for 5 weeks but no other symptoms. I never ever have a sore throat, so I was concerned. Eventually phoned GP – was able to speak to him quite easily. He told me to phone back in a month if not better, which I did. He then prescribed a product to combat thrush type infections which seemed to help. I also discussed a long running( since January) ear problem . I was informed that were it not for Covid he would refer me to ENT Department. I also became exceedingly anxious about a mole on my leg which had changed in appearance. As I had a friend who died from skin cancer I was worried. The receptionist who was operating triage said that NHS did not deal with warts. I insisted on speaking to a Dr. He asked me to send a photo. It was very difficult to take a picture on a phone with 1 hand whilst trying to pull the back of my leg round … it was verystressful. Unsurprisingly the GP could not tell fromthis-also I was upset operating the technology on my phone to send it. The GP asked me to come to surgery so he could check. He met me in the car park of the surgery. He was dressed in a plastic apron and ordinary mask-I was wearing a mask too. He took me in the back door-I whisked up my trouser leg, he took a look, and immediately said it was an old age thing, no problem. However, he said it was good to be careful. It is becomimg inceasing difficult to get a phone appointment with a GP. I tried this week again about my ears, took 2 days and waiting in a queue for 15 minutes 1 day, and 11 the next. I am now expecting a phone call from GP later this week. I have found it much harder to be alone concerning my health during lockdown. My anxiety levels have been high because I have been more inclined to think about myself due to lack of activites outside the home. In addition my late husband was a retired GP , and he would always advise me whether an ailment was worth worrying about. I have also had rapid heart beats, but think that these are to some extent due to anxiety. I dislike the fact that I am preoccupied with my health. Now , July 2020, I have adjusted to this method of living. It is tedious, at times I feel sad, but I try to enjoy what I can. If this is going to be the rest of my life I must be as positive as I can. However, I think I have displaced my anxiety about the future into worries about my health! The Government I do not feel the Government has dealt well with Covid. We have the highest rate of Covid in Europe. Clearly we were too late beginning Covid lockdown. -too late making masks obligatory. We had not prepared for a pandemic by amassing protective clothing inspite of being advised that this was going to happen. We did not have tests in place-many many old people were discharged from hospital without having Covid tests, so the virus spread rapidly. I am fairly sure the Winter will bring more outbreaks. I just hope my grandchildren can go to school. There will be local lockdowns. I do not know how the Government can keep the economy going as well as protect us from the virus. We are being encouraged to go out and spend money, but also social distance. There is the added difficulty that some members of society are more at risk than others. News. I listen to the news on Radio 4 at 8 or 9am , and sometimes 1 and 6pm. If there is nothing else I watch 10.00pm news on BBC1. In addition I have checked news on my phone. I do not think this is healthy-and certainly I have turned off programmes or descriptions of effects of the virus. There have been many horrifying interviews. I did not watch the Government broadcasts on Covid because I did not believe what was said. I feel obliged to keep up to date with what is permitted, and to have some idea whether the virus is increasing or not. It is depressing to be in the cohort of the elderly. I will be 70 later this year-no chance of the celebrations I would liked to have had. I feel as though we are rather a nuisance-high risk-not contributing anything to the economy, and best of of sight. I do not know anyone who has had challenges accessing the news. I do have a friend without access to the internet and lacking the skills to use it. She is very much at a disadvantage now that so much extra is available on line-particularly cultural events, online shopping, extra links to friends, research . It will get worse. I dislike technology , but I am grateful to my children who urged me to have a smart phone 2 years ago, and helped me use it. Work and Home Life I am retired . I was widowed a few years ago, and had become accustomed to life alone in the house-also made easier by the fact that I was an only child and used to my own company. However, the fact that I could not see people and carry out my usual activities was very hard to bear. I was most upset by separation from my 2 children, their spouses and families who also live in Bristol. Enforced separation from your loved ones is awful. Once single people were able to be a in a social bubble with another household I joined up with my daughter and family . We mostly met going for walks, and then in their garden. I have tried to help with home schooling my 8 year old granddaughter. During the last 6 weeks of term her 5 year old brother was permitted to go to school 2 days a week, but she was not eligible. She was depressed and angry, particularly missing her peer group. At first I worked in the garden with her-even in the rain!! Soon it became evident that she was not responding to this approach, so I changed to going for walks and talking about nature, history, street architecture etc. anything which caught her interest. I also read my old childhood favourite books to her-Heidi and Worzel Gummidge, which have gone down well. The lockdown has affected my relationships with my children. Because my daughter is working full time at home, I hardly ever see her, and when I do she is not relaxed. We no longer have outings together, and will be unable to go away for a few days together in the Autumn as we have been doing for a few years. My relationship with my son has changed completely. He is very busy as Head of a Primary school, and his wife is pregnant. I have been socially distant from them. I miss having a hug from him. I no longer go in his house or garden, but only see him and family in a public place. However, he remains a loving and concerned son, so I am fortunate. No physical contact is extremely hard when you live alone. I made the decision to hug my older grandchildren in June. Tears came to my eyes the first time I held their hands when out. I miss holding the hand of my 3 year old grandchild – my son's daughter. Her parents are worried about Spreading germs both ways. I am sad-the new grandchild should be born in October, but I doubt I will be able to handle it or even be in the same room. This is tragic. Technology I have had to learn how to use a tablet and set it up by instructions over the phone from my long suffering daughter. She has also helped me install zoom and use it. I can now initiate meetings for several people, and do a presentation with photos for zoom. I have had French lessons on zoom for 4 months-I don't like it, but better than nothing. I have 2 bookgroups via zoom, and use it to talk weekly to a close friend in Yorkshire who is having a hard time . I have had lectures from organisations on zoom which have been good-but oh, how I wish to be able go to talks in person as I used to do. I hate the fact that I never go out at night. I feel as though I am in my 80s not nearly 70 in terms of my lifestyle. I was using WhatsApp before with friends and family, however, my use of the facility to send photos has increased. We also have a street WhatsApp group which has been useful-neighbours have helped those shielding . On occasions people have bought me things I needed. I have phoned friends, especially those living alone, more often on landlines during Covid. I never use social media platforms Shopping. I tried to get online deliveries with Waitrose, Tescos, and Sainsburys. However, I am not yet 70, or on the officlal vulnerable list, although I have respiratory problems, so could not get any. I used a local company on one occasion which used to supply restaurants but, although the delivery was prompt, choice was limited and it was very expensive. My daughter then offered to buy me weekly greengrocery and bread, and top up groceries. I lent her my trolley on wheels-she does not have a car but lives very near the shops. This has worked well. My son also did 2 shopping trips for me and brought them over. At first I was very strict with myself on not eating too much-fearing I might run out of food or get fat. Lately I have been more relaxed, especially as I have now been twice to the supermarket for myself-it has been so nice to be able look and choose things. I have been cooking properly all the time. Yesterday I shared a meal outside in the garden of friends. It was a real treat to have food prepared by someone else. I have lost weight during Covid-partly stress, partly more exercise . Entertainment and Leisure I have not started anything new. I have continued to read a great deal-my own, plus two book group titles a month. I read a mixture, some modern but also classic fiction, some history/biography/popular science. I have been reading my way through the extensive library left by my husband. I access book club and foreign fiction via my kindle, and also make use of books left out on local walls. At first my concentration was poor, but I am now getting through about the same number of books as before Covid. I read French books and magazines, and listen to French podcasts. I was having French lessons via zoom until June. Again this is part of my usual activity. I have done more gardening than usual. I had a project at the beginning of lockdown to paint a couple of garden walls white. I achieved this during the hot spell, and have been delighted with the results. I doubt whether I would have accomplished this now, as I feel rather unmotivated. I have walked every day for an hour initially-latterly sometimes an hour and a half to two hours. This is not something I would have done before lockdown, although I belonged to a walking group which met monthly. Mostly I was walking to some activity and bussing back. I have really appreciated watching the trees and flowerrs emerge and change in the gardens and green spaces. I have listened to my many classical CDS. I have read several newspapers on line every day. This is different -previously I just had a Saturday newspaper. More time is spent on the phone, emails etc keeping in touch with friends . At first I did two sessions of pilates at home on my own-now just one. It is hard to keep at this. I opted out of zoom sessions with my normal class as I feel I have enough zoom activity. Besides, I can remember the exercises. I have watched far too much television. This is because I no longer go out at night. I now have a tablet and watch foreign drama series on All4 . I like art and history programmes on BBC4 and various series such as Miss America which are informative as well as entertaining. I listen to the radio during meals and kitchen preparation-usually Radio 4 , sometimes Radio 3 or classic FM. Personal Hygeine No change. However, it is boring not needing to dress for particular occasions. I have always tried to make an effort to look nice when meeting people or going out, and liked accessories such as jewellery, scarves etc. There has been no point in doing this which has been rather demoralising. Now I am seeing people I'm trying . I wear trousers and tops all the time, but at least they are different ones. Until last week I had not had a hair cut since January. It was strange to have longer hair – hadn't been that way for about 25 years. I needed to tie it back at one stage. However, following the comments of two friends that they liked my longer hair I decided to keep it longer than before. The shape of my face has changed-thinner! And I have obviously aged visually. Sleep During the initial period of the lockdown I slept very well. I think it was because there was nothing I could do-no decisions could be made about anything except food and exercise. As restictions have been limited my sleep has been disturbed. I have worried about physical symptoms – fearing all sorts of fatal illnesses. I have had to read more and more often in the middle of the night to rrelax myself, and even had to get up and make tea . I also listen to the radio, World Service and Radio 3. Recently I have had a recuurence of my breathing difficulties which have interruped my sleep too. I do not want to let insomnia get hold of me. I know it is hard to get out of this pattern. I have several friends who are chronic insomniacs. For a while after my husband died I was sleeping very badly, but had managed to cure myself of this. I try not to worry about my failure to sleep as I am aware this is counterproductive. I have not had any dreams."

The things that make you feel ill, affect your ability to live your day to day life, that cause you pain or discomfort, or that may ultimately lead to your death. Your “wellbeing” is a much broader term in comparison, and in some ways more difficult to define, as it can encompass things like your emotional and mental health and how you’re feeling, as well as things such as if you’re getting enough sleep, do you have a healthy and varied diet and how active you are. Your health and wellbeing are closely interconnected and the ebbs and flows of the one can have a direct impact upon the other. So a cancer diagnosis, for instance, is a health concern, but it will also likely impact upon on your mental and emotional wellbeing as well. Or a poor diet may invariably result in health complaints, such as obesity or diabetes. When I think of “a healthy body”, the first five words or phrases that come to mind are illnessfree, fit, strong, slim and hard-work. Thereisn’t a particular person that comes to mind, but I would say it would probably be someone young, fit and healthy, with a lean, athletic body. Someone that watches what they eat and makes sure that they are moving their bodies regularly and often pushes their body in their pursuit of fitness. It is a body that is born not out of luck or good genes, but rather from drive, determination and self-control. And yet, as I am writing this and really reflecting on and interrogating my answer to this question, this doesn’t feel right to me. Rather this seems to me to be such an extreme way to visualise a healthy body. This almost obsessive control of how your body moves and how you ‘fuel’ it. A relationship defined by denial, domination and pushing your body to extremes. Of almost punishing it. Surely a healthy body is one that allows you to do and pursue the things that you want to do. A gentle, loving and reciprocal relationship of tending to the needs of your body so that you are able to fulfil your needs, wants and desires. Where the softness or hardness of your body isn’t a shorthand determination of whether it is healthy or not. So reflecting on this again, I would rather define “a healthy body” as one that is rested, nurtured, nourished, respected and loved. Identity How has my experience of health been shaped and influenced by my identity? For a start, my ethnicity is British and French. I was born and raised in Britain where we have the NHS. This has meant that I have had theprivilege of access to medical care, from when I was in my mother’s womb to adulthood (and hopefully beyond, depending on what our callous Conservative government does to it), largely completely free of charge. Any medical issues or concerns, I have been able to see a medical worker, which in itself is already a vast privilege that is far from available to everyone around the world, without any concerns of whether I can afford it or if I have the correct health insurance. I have never had to compromise my health or do without because of the cost of medical attention. As a child, I was immunised against various illnesses that could have severely or detrimentally affected my health, or even resulted in death. This again is not something that children living elsewhere necessarily have access to. Living during this global pandemic has also made me even more greatly appreciative and grateful for the privilege of our NHS. I am aware though, that not everyone receives the same treatment by our health system in the UK. As a woman, I have been through three pregnancies and labours. I remember one of my university lecturers saying that the effect of pregnancy and childbirth on a woman’s internal body was comparable to a car crash. Despite this staying vividly with me over the years, I never had any concerns that pregnancy or labour could result in me losing my life. This is, however, a very real risk for women giving birth in countries where there is no adequate access to medical care. It is also a very real threat for Black women, for instance, where they are four times more likely than white women to die in pregnancy or childbirth in the UK. This is just one specific example, but the reality is there are racial disparities, that can have fatal outcomes, in the medical care that Black and people of colour receive in the UK because of racial bias, prejudice and discrimination. As a white woman, my skin colour has never been a risk factor in the medical care that I receive. Indeed, I have white privilege because of it. An illustration of this is how the medical community centres whiteness. Last year a Black medical student in the UK produced a medical handbook of how symptoms, such as rashes, present different on Black and brown skin, as he noticed that much of the literature and clinical photos only focused on white bodies. As well as race, social class can also be a factor in disparities of healthcare across the UK. I would say that I grew up in a working class family. My father was a carpenter, working on building sites. He did not have a lot of job security and there were many periods of my childhood where he was between jobs and we struggled financially, although my parents protected us from these financial worries. One time our washing machine broke, so my uncle bought a new one for us. My great aunt would buy my brother and I new school shoes at the beginning of the school year. My mother supplemented my father’s wages by tutoring and teaching French, at home and at a local technical college. However, although working class, we were also fortunate. We lived in a semi-detached home, with its own large garden, near areas with large open green spaces. We had easy access to various shops and supermarkets, as well as our own vegetable patch and fruit and nut trees. We didn’t live in cramped housing in a built up inner city area, for instance, where some working class families live and where there are issues of higher pollution, a lack of outdoor space and limited food shops and which can lead to poor health outcomes. We were not financially affluent but my parents never had to worry about getting proper medical care for myself and my brother, from doctors, opticians and dentists, due to the NHS. My mother did go without dental and optician check ups, as these were not covered for adults. Now as an adult, my husband and I could be described as being middle class. We are financially comfortable, can pay prescription costs without any worries and both have dental cover, compared to my mother her sacrificed her own dental check ups. So there are many aspects of my identity where I hold privilege in terms of how they have influenced my experiences of health and wellbeing.   Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing  I’m not sure where and when I first became aware of the concepts of “health” and “wellbeing”. I’m sure that it most likelywould have been in a school environment, where knowledge about health and wellbeing were interwoven into the curriculum, where relevant. For instance, learning about the different food groups and the benefits of a healthy and varied diet in Science or Food Technology and the importance of being active in Biology and PE. I do remember some specific talks in secondary school around periods and sanitary products, as well as another on sexual health, which caused much mirth, embarrassment and silliness in a room full of teenagers. I don’t recall any conversations around health and wellbeing with my parents, however. It was they that were responsible for my health and wellbeing growing up, although essentially it was mainly my mother that looked after my day to day health. From looking after me when I was ill and booking doctors, dentist and optician appointments, to my daily vitamin and a rich and varied diet, supplemented by fresh produce from our vegetable garden and fruit and nut trees. She did it all, for all of us. Although we weren’t an especially sportyfamily, we were quite active. We spent countless hours of my childhood endlessly roaming vast antique fairs and car boot sales, wandering around air shows and picnicking at local beauty spots, especially our favourite Clumber Park. I was aware that my parents valued fresh air, sending us out into the garden once we were out of the coldness of the winter months as much as they could, or perhaps it was their way of trying to avoid the inevitable arguments between my brother and I if we were cooped up too long together. We spent many hours in our garden, playing on our swing and slide sets, exploring and hiding inside the middle of the vast overgrown bush at the very back of the garden, reading in the sunshine, and, as we got older, lending a hand to the gardening chores (weeding was definitely my least favourite!). I feel sorry for my children, with their small patch of grass that has to make do as a garden in our London suburb, compared to the lush and expansive garden of my childhood, filled with flowers, bushes, shrubs, trees, a vegetable patch and a vast array of other types of greenery. So my parents cultivated a family lifestyle that was healthy and active, rather than sitting down and having specific conversations around health and wellbeing.  And really, I think that is probably it for how I learnt about health and wellbeing growing up. It wasn’t really a topic that greatly interested me, and to be honest, it still doesn’t even now. So I never sought out information about it through books, magazines, or friends, outside of anything necessary for schoolwork. Key moments I suppose that it was in my early years at secondary school that I started to first become aware of changes happening to my body because of puberty, such as the development of breasts, the growing and darkening of hairs on my legs and underarms. I have a particular memory of sitting in the sports field we used for PE, and feeling embarrassed of the hairs on my exposed legs and trying to arrange myself in such a way as to hide them, whilst surreptitiously trying to see if the other girls in my class were shaving their legs yet, or not. Indeed, I think that embarrassment, awkwardness and insecurities characterised much of my experiences of those pivotal milestones of puberty and ‘becoming a woman’. Added to this, the extra pressure and anxiety of not wanting to be ‘left behind’ byyour friends, as you all developed at different stages and times, and it all made for one hot hormonal mess. Urgh, and teasing little brothers too! But it wasn’t all bad either. There was also a sense of feeling proud when I achieved a milestone and this growing sense of awareness that I was no longer a child.  The biggest milestone of puberty for me was most definitely, finally, getting my first period. I was feeling increasingly anxious and impatient to start my period, as one by one, it felt like all of my friends and the other girls in my class were already getting their periods. It was a common conversation and question amongst each other about whether you had had your period yet or not, and feeling jealous and not a little concerned to find out another friend had joined this ‘elite’ club that you were not yet a part of, and the embarrassment of having to admitthat no, I’ve still not had mine yet. I can remember trying to bluff that I didn’t even want my period yet, considering how much those that were menstruating complained of the pain. I don’t know if I sounded convincing or not, but my interrogator didn’t have anything to reply to my assertion. So it was with some relief, a little bit of pride, the realisation that there were things far more pleasant things to look forward to, and the anxiety of figuring out sanitary products and hoping that it was not obvious that I was using one, that I had my first period. I can’t recall if I confided in my friends or not that I had finally achieved that hallowed milestone. Likely I kept my precious secret to myself until the next time the conversation around periods started and the question was asked. I did rather shyly tell my mother and then was horrified when my father whispered to me later that day that he had heard of mynews, and then furiouslyhaving to pretend that I wasn’t bothered by this insensitive betrayal.    Smaller milestones in my journey through puberty were shaving my legs and getting my first bra, both of which my mother initiated and guided me through once she thought I was at the necessary age. My mother herself used an electric epilator, and so that was what she bought for me. I was quite used to seeing her using her epilator growing up, but when it was my turn to use one myself, it felt quite intimidating. It was this loud, whirling, scary thing and in the face of it I was terrified that it was going to hurt (it did) and maybe even rip myskin off (it didn’t). I was relieved when my first experience was over and pleased to no longer have to try and hide my legs with their downy hair but the epilator and I never became friends. It was so hideously noisy and it just drew attention to this private ritual of hair removal. I used to play music on my CD player whenever I used it to try and drown out its racket. Moving to a hall of residence when I started university quickly spelled the death of my epilator, as I was so super paranoid about the noise of it. I sought advice from one of my university friends and moved to much more discreet razors. As for my first bra, I think that was probably the most excruciatingly embarrassing experience of all. It was squeezed into one of our weekly grocery and household shopping trips into town, as we walked back down the highstreet after having purchased our fruit and veg at various stalls at the market, stopping off here and there at shops where needed. One of those stops being at the quite luridly named ‘Bumps and Boobs’, whose shop front was covered in lingerie. I wanted a big hole to just swallow me up as we made our way into the shop and I just desperately hoped that no one from school had seen me go in. Two older ladies did the fitting. They probably weren’t even that old but to me looked ancient, and the whole experience was just mortifying. Did I mention that my little brother was with us too? Even now I feel my cheeks getting red just thinking about it all. Goodness, puberty was not a fun experience, and I’m glad that these milestones are well behind me. I do hope though that they will ensure that I am sensitive and empathetic when my own children start to experience puberty. And I’m thankful that I still have a little while yet until then!        Growing older  I have to be honest in that health and wellbeing have not necessarily been things that have interested me, so there is little that I have actively done to maintain my health since I became responsible for my own health upon leaving home all those many years ago. I make most of the meals for myself and my family from scratch. Although I am aware that this can be healthier than some pre-prepared or frozen meals, for instance, this has not been because I’m trying to reduce or eliminate ‘harmful’ or ‘unhealthy’ ingredients. Rather, I grew up on home-cooked meals and also, as a mother to three small children, I enjoy the pockets of time all to myself that I get whilst cooking, happily catching up on my podcasts. We have ‘healthy’ meals but, with my French ancestry, I am also not afraid of using ‘naughty’ ingredients. I am not restrictive in how I approach food, probably as some form of rejection against my upbringing, where my mother was openly hyper controlling of not only of what she ate, but what she also allowed me to eat. There have been periods where I have participated in physical activity, such as running around campus with R and PE with Joe during the first lockdown, but these have been for a specific period of time and certainly nothing consistently over the years. So perhaps a kind of benign neglect in terms of my physical health. I would say, however, that since having my children, it has been more on my mind that I need to ensure that I’m healthy, so that I can be around for them as long as possible. I just need to put that into action more. I have been better at booking appointments for medical concerns for myself, although this has been more once my children have been a little older, as in the baby years I found it almost impossible to find the time to prioritise myself in that way. I also took great care of what I was eating during my pregnancies, eliminating foods that could be risky during pregnancy, most especially with my first child, and also took folic acid and pregnancy and breastfeeding supplements. In terms of maintaining my mental health, prior to becoming a mother, this wasn’t something that I ever really needed to intentionally take care of. I was able to pursue my hobbies and interests freely and my time outside of work was my own, which I happily spent with R. Becoming a mother, I went from being able to do more or less as I pleased, to suddenly being completely responsible for this adorable, precious and utterly helpless baby that relied on me for everything. To keep it safe and warm and loved. To feed, clothe and keep it clean. Everything. Those newborn day are magical, but they are also all consuming and I sacrificed so much of my own basic care and time to myself for my baby, doing nothing other than holding and caring for my darling bundle. Now a mama to three young children (two, five and six years old), my days have changed from the intensity of those newborn days, but there are a lot of demands on me from my family. I have many hobbies and interests, from taking photos of my kids, memory keeping, documenting my little family and our life, researching my family history, reading, and so on, which bring me much contentment and fulfilment. Time to myself is also immensely important for me, as an extreme introvert, in order to be able to recharge. I have learnt in my journey of motherhood that I need to be intentional in carving out time for myself to pursue and indulge in my passions and also to find time to myself, as much as I am able to within the midst of our busy everyday lives, and how vital this is to my mental health. I am very conscious that when I neglect my mental health, not only do I feel horrible, yucky and low, but that I am not my best self for my husband and our kiddos. I struggle to give them the emotional care that they need, if I myself am not filled up. This has been further reaffirmed to me during this global pandemic, where we have spent extended periods on top of each other all together at home, as well as multiple periods of home learning my bigger two children. I have had intense periods of suffering emotionally over this time, as I had literally no time to myself and didn’t have any time to indulge in my passions that help to fill me up. As I get older, I expect that I will become much more intentional about actively maintaining my health and wellbeing, however. I think that this is likely to be a natural consequence of getting older, as when you age you are increasingly more likely to experience health issues and your body is also not able to move or work in the same way as it perhaps did when you were younger. I think also that as you get older, you may start to lose the sense of invincibility and the assumption of a long life ahead of you, and so the maintaining and the prolonging of your health and life, as much as possible, becomes more important.  I don’t tend to seek out general information about health and wellbeing. Sometimes one of the podcasts that I listen to features an episode on the subject of health and wellbeing, such as the Guadian’s ‘Today In Focus’ podcast, or a news article may catch my eye, but otherwise these are not topics that I have a general interest in. When I was pregnant with my eldest and his newborn and baby months, I did intensely research every little thing pregnancy and babyhood, however. I read pregnancy and baby books, including one book that showed day by day how your baby was growing and developing in the womb, installed a pregnancy tracker app on my phone to track pregnancy symptoms and baby growth, signed up to any pregnancy and baby newsletter I came across (I especially loved the weekly pregnancy emails telling me what fruit or vegetable my growing little one was now the size of), researched the foods that I should avoid during the pregnancy and those that were touted as being beneficial, worried myself with miscarriage statistics, and so on. When he was born, I experienced crippling anxiety and selfdoubt and sought to counteract it through research. I would obsessively research online any tiny symptom or complaint that he had, look up tips and videos about latching on and breastfeeding, seek reassurance around co-sleeping and his unwillingness to sleep anywhere but on my chest, and research forthcoming milestones and developments. My mummy friends and L, our family friend who is also a midwife, were also constantly consulted and I was taking him to the health visitor every single week. I was a big ball of anxiety, compulsively researching to death anything to do with pregnancy and my precious little boy. Thankfully I slowly learnt to trust myself more and to just go with the flow of motherhood. My second and third pregnancies and newborn days were a lot less fraught and anxious and I didn’t feel the need to obsessively research every little thing. And this is how I am continuing in my motherhood journey. As long as my children are happy and healthy, that is the main thing. I only research specific ailments or symptoms that my children or myself are suffering from, such as the NHS website. Or alternatively, I just snap a photo and send it to my brother and his partner for advice, as they are both doctors. During this pandemic, especially at the beginning where I was particularly anxious, I did find myself obsessively researching, like I did during my first pregnancy, as way to try and alleviate my worries, as much as I could. I watched the daily Downing Street Press briefings, read news articles on the BBC News app and just generally kept myself up to date about the symptoms, the prevalence of the virus in the UK and globally, the vaccines and so on. Although still concerned, I am nowhere near as anxious as I was, but it still keep myself informed through news articles and my trusted ‘Today In Focus’ podcast.  There have been periods of my life when I have been intensely aware of my body and other periods where I have been less so. Where I have been super aware of my body has been during periods of great changes in my body, such as during puberty or pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, for instance, I adored my growing bump, which my hands would always gravitate towards resting on, and I was so in awe of and grateful for how my body was literally creating new life and how it was changing and adapting to accommodate this baby that I was growing, nurturing and protecting in my womb. And how this body then safely laboured and birthed my little ones and how I was able to feed and sustain them through the milk produced in my own breasts. These are periods where you cannot help but be profoundly aware of and full of gratitude for your body and its capabilities. Where as in this current period of my life, I have more of a niggling awareness of what my body is not, in terms of not quite in the shape I would wish for, I will always be forever grateful for what my body has done in terms of giving me my three precious children. Health, wellbeing and appearance  For myself, I believe that external appearance is separate to health and wellbeing, but I do think that there is a wider societal blurring of these concepts. For instance, vitamins and supplements, which although are products to help you to maintain your health, are also available for ‘healthier’ and ‘stronger’ hair and nails, for example. Or exercise routines to keep you fit but to also achieve a particular more desirable body shape (‘legs, bums and tums’ routines, I’m thinking of you). We live in a society and culture where beauty and physical appearance are heavily prized. The images that we see on the screen, advertisements and social media, for instance, are liberally airbrushed and faces expertly made up with make-up. Celebrities and people in the public eye are aware of how to pose or dress a certain way to create the illusion of having a perfect body. When we are constantly assaulted with these unrealistic distortions of female or male beauty, it is difficult not to feel that you are inadequate or ugly in comparison and there is a pressure to try and achieve these desired aesthetics. I myself struggle with feeling that I do not meet up to popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance. I wish that I was prettier or that my skin was clearer. My body is softer and more generous than it has ever been, as a result of three pregnancies and a global pandemic where I have primarily spent the last year mostly within the confines of my home, which I have a lot of feelings of shame around. I shave my underarm and leg hair daily, and pluck and shape my eyebrows. As a teenager and young adult, I tried various cleansers and toners to try and ‘fix’ myspot prone skin, but when it didn’t result in the perfect skin I desperately wanted, I stopped taking care of my skin, as I felt it wasn’t taking care of me. This past year, I have learnt to look after my skin properly and get great contentment from my twice daily rituals of ‘cleanse, tone and moisturise’ of my skin. Although I’m not drawn to makeup, I always applyfoundation in the morning, regardless of if I’m going out or not. So there are certainly ways that I have internalised these societal ideals around beauty and physical beauty and how I act them out on my own body. I would struggle without my razor, tweezer, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, cleanser, toner, moisturiser, facial oil, foundation or concealer. I would not feel presentable and able to face the world without them. If I was deserted on a desert island, however, I could probably happily survive without most of these, provided that I was deserted by myself that is. If I could take only one beauty product, it would probably be a multipurpose product, such as Neal’s Yard Wild Rose Beauty Balm, which can be used as a cleanser, moisturiser, face mask, treat dryspot or bump and bruises, amongst many other things. It’s an amazing product and smells divine too! Although there are some beauty standards that I have internalised, I am also realistic with whom I am and what I look like and I, sometimes begrudgingly, accept that this is who I am. Although I may wish to be stunning and to have the perfect body, I also don’t want to manipulate my body and face through medical procedures, cosmetic injections, punishing fitness routines, excessive make up or so on. I think there needs to be a wider and more inclusive acceptance of beauty in all forms and more scrutiny and regulation of the manipulated beauty standards and images that we are constantly bombarded with daily.  As for my parents, it is hard to say how much, if at all, they have been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical experience, as this was not a topic that I can recall having any conversations with them about. I can say that my mother took care of her appearance, applying make-up and styling her hair, which was dyed, daily. She moisturised her face and body, and plucked and epilated her body hair. So these rituals could certainly be interpreted as acting out beauty ideals. I would say though that I think that both my parents valued a slim physique. My father would complain every so often that my mother was feeding him too much and making him fat (he wasn’t). They would both make critical remarks about friends, acquaintances or, even on some occasions, strangers, that they felt were overweight. My mother was extremely restrictive and obsessive about the foods that she ate. Often just a piece of toast, some cottage cheese and an apple. I was very familiar with the sight of my mother weighing herself. She was also vigilant in her policing of my weight and the amount of types of food that I was allowed to eat. I remember as a young child my grandmother indulging me with a biscuit and my mother refusing it on my behalf whilst withering declaring that I ate like a horse. I would only have been in primary school at the time. I hesitate, however, to lay my mother’s relationship with food and her body solely at the feet of beauty standards. For one reason because it was not something that I felt that I could really engage her in conversation about. For another, because I believe that she likely suffered from an eating disorder, which tend to also be about regaining some sort of control through your relationship with your body and food. Getting ready to leave the house  For most of my childhood, my mother tutored all ages, from young to old, in French from our dining room table. A couple of evenings a week she would also teach French at our local college. My father worked as a carpenter for various building firms. The ways that they got ready to leave the house for their respective jobs had their similarities and differences. They would be the donning of outdoor clothing, such as coats and shoes, but where as my mother would have got all her belongings, bags, teaching resources, etc that she needed ready, my father relied on my mother to prepare and get his bag, thermos of hot coffee and his lunch for him, with the exception of his tools, which he would get from the shed himself. We always locked our front door, and whoever would leave the house would also lock the door behind them or whoever was seeing them off would do so instead. If the house was going to be empty, my mother would be the one to set the house alarm. My rituals for leaving the house largely depend on the reason for venturing out, as well as if anybody will be with me or not. During this past year or so of the pandemic, I am mostly only leaving the house to take my children to their respective pre-school or school, or to pick them up. Otherwise, we are all mostly at home, and have only ventured out to the shops a handful of times since just before the first national lockdown, mostly relying on online deliveries. Whenever I am due to leave the house, I always make sure that I visit the bathroom first and then do a quick check in the bathroom mirror that I’m neat and presentable. Then it’s a case of putting on my outdoor shoes and coat, which are all stored in our porch, picking up a mask from the top of the shoe cabinet and locking the front door. If the house will be empty, I also activate the house alarm and home security camera systems. I’m ready and out of the door in next to no time. When it’s the school run, however, imagine a similar routine, but a million time more chaotic. I’m rushing around to fill up drinks bottles, fetching homework folders, reading books or whatever else needs to be handed in that particular day, getting out shoes, coats, as well as winter hats, scarfs, gloves, summer hats, etc depending on the season, repeatedly asking the children to put on their shoes and coats (which more often than not, ends up in me repeating myself over and over, getting increasingly louder and more frantic each time – the littlest, who is only two, gets a pass on this, with either myself or my husband getting her ready), and then finally resorting to putting on shoes and coats for them myself, all whilst getting myself ready."

Its now the 2nd week of November and the 2nd week of another lockdown. Like many people I’m particularly disappointed in Boris Johnson for implementing another lockdown when he intimated he would never do so. We had the local ‘tier’ system started and before that had a chance to work, he went straight into another lockdown. Clearly politics are at play, as dodgy stats from the government scientistic advisors were leaked to the Times and Boris was bounced into the new measures. Critics now call it a ‘panicdemic’ and believe it completely unnecessary. In the Daily Telegraph on Saturday 30th Oct, historian and commentator Guy De La Bedoyere compared the government advisors to the Roman soothsayers, with their prediction of 4000 daily deaths by December (the latest deaths recorded for people who died with covid was 156 for Sunday 8/11/20). Further, he claimed that 40 years ago, there were 50,000 excess deaths a year, compared to now. This was explained by improvements in diet and medical treatments. Basically we are keeping people alive for longer who would previous have died. In one week in 1665 London saw the equivalent 130,000 deaths. His view was that we have resorted to a medieval superstitious frame of mind, which has been fuelled by egotistical scientists. Other commentators have been critical of the risk adverse society we now live in compared to a few decades ago. Risk assessments are a feature of the workplace but we have taken the same mentality into our general lives, where children at play are observed and controlled at all times, surfaces are disinfected, speed cameras and road humps every where, warning signs on hot drink cups etc etc We have been so risk adverse that we have frightened the next generation to do anything unless all risk has been eliminated – before long we won’t leave our homes. The newspapers (online versions) over the last few days have all carried stories about the dodgy data, that certain graphs were scaled up and were based on data from before 9th Oct. Evidence is coming through that cities that had had high infection rates (Manchester/Liverpool) have seen a plateauing out. I have personally seen no evidence locally of any effects of the pandemic. Apart from the wearing of masks in shops and now the closure of pubs – nothing has changed. I even committed on an internet site, if there had been a huge increase in deaths, why aren't the roads clogged with hearses and courteges? I had been using the pubs and thought how safe and well run they had become. The measures were updated in October and you had to wear a mask to enter and move around a pub. No bar service and no standing. There was plenty of hand gels around and Wetherspoon pubs had installed screens around tables.Waiter service to your table is a vast improvement on bar service and I hope it continues long after the covid threat. The new clampdown have thrown up some odd rules. Richard Littlejohn writing in the Mail highlighted that you can sleep with your wife but can’t play tennis with her and you can shoot ducks but you can’t feed them! After our emergence from the first lockdown in June, I started back at the gym and pubs etc Many men I knew and hadn't seen since before lockdown, were now sporting facial hair and beards (me included). In my case it just happened – I cut my chin shaving at the start of May and couldn't shave for a few days. I ended up leaving it on. Bit of a novelty really, as I haven't grown one before, and I’ve still got it. It has also been mentioned on the radio – the number of men who grew beards during lockdown – because they were working from home and didn't have the discipline of going into work every day. The same has happened with dress codes. No suits/ties for men or smart wear for ladies whilst working from home. Apparently, the sale of female pyjamas has soared, with record sales of them at  Primark. Ladies are wearing them whilst working from home. However, places like M&S have struggled to sell their more formal wear – not just work clothes, but because with the restrictions placed on pubs, restaurants, theatres etc – there is nowhere to wear them.  I became involved with M.O. after reading ‘Our Hidden Lives’ by Simon Garfield. It is extracts of diaries written by five ordinary people at the end of the last war. All the diarists have interesting views/comments but I found one of the females, given the nomenclature Edie Rutherford, particularly interesting. Her forthright views came across as if she was in the room – I'm convinced she wrote the same as she spoke. Some of it was gossip or comments from the papers, but she had a view and opinion of the world. Its a book that I frequently pick up a read a few pages of, even though I’ve read it many times. As a result I’ve made comparisons between then and now. The events they went through and our problems now. There was a general and widespread criticism of the government, bureaucrats, housing officials back then. Exactly the same now. They had food rationing and we had food hoarding and we all had to queue to get into shops.  There was a general dislike of foreigners back in 1945 – complaints that they having food rationing to give to Europe when they had won the war. Complaints that foreigners were given housing before natives. Nothing has changed in the present day vis a vis refugees coming into the UK. They were also impatient for the Nuremburg trials to end, a belief that they were being dragged out by the Nazis to evade the death sentences. Similarly, the same comments are heard today re the endless Brexit negotiations that are going on. Also noted was the criticism of the New Years Honours going to undeserving recipients from the establishment or Civil Service. Nothing changes! In 1945, all diarists seemed to have a good knowledge of events. They had no mindless television cooking or celebrity programs to watch but relied on the radio- listening to drama, comedy and news from the BBC. I’ve noticed that during the pandemic the viewing and listening habits changed for a lot of people. The daily hourly update during the 1st lockdown was compulsive viewing for many, who, usually took very little interest in current affairs. People were having to understand a lot more, other than the usual trivia they had filled their lives with. I hope this in current affairs continues. My daughter S works at a local vets as a receptionist/administrator. At the end of last week a neighbour across the road had booked their dog George in for a minor procedure at the same vets. We will often speak to the neighbours and our dog Bella likes their dog George. They are always pleasant people. However, late morning on the Friday S answered a call from the man wanted to know if George was ready to be collected after his op. S checked and said he hadn't be seen yet. (It had been a very busy morning – with an emergency to deal with). The man became very irate and hostile – he must have known that it was S he was speaking to. Twenty minutes later he pulls up in the car park and storms into the reception (completely against procedure – whereby you should wait outside to be seen). Again, in reception he was very upset and rude and left with George. Over the weekend, him and his relatives sent numerous emails to the vets complaining! We discussed this amongst my family and were quite taken back by the behaviour of the neighbours, who we thought were usually quiet and rational. Sophie said that she had noticed since the first lockdown that some people (clients) she dealt with at work, had became less patient, rude and sometimes short tempered! Was this a consequence of the stresses of lockdown? Are their latent behaviours/characteristics that are coming to the fore during this stressful and difficult period? I have a Cardiology appointment tomorrow with Milton Keynes hospital. (I have an irregular heart beat). I’m pleased that they rang yesterday and asked if I was happy for the consultation to go ahead over the phone. There has been several reports highlighting that hospitals appear to be a source of infection for Covid – figures suggest that anywhere from 10 – 30% of people in hospital acquire Covid whilst there. Infact, it is the staff who are the culprits because they socialise in the canteen, hug each other, wear uniforms outside and are not as strict as required. This may be a generalisation, but likewise with the MRSA superbug, hospitals are dangerous places to pick up infections and I’m glad I’m not going into one at present. I’m going to wrap this up. Next time I write – we should be out of this lockdown and through Christmas. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals have just announced a 90% effective Covid vaccination. Hopefully, we will have turned the corner and some normality will return?"

Wellbeing is not so easy to define. It is more than being healthy, it is about being happy and content as well. When I think of a healthy body I think of the following words: lean, strong, flexible, supple, and agile. I come from a working class background and grew up in the 1980s. I don’t remember anyone mentioning health and wellbeing to me as a child. My parents didn’t exercise, though they weren’t particularly unhealthy. They both worked and were slim, though they did both smoke cigarettes and we ate a lot of ready meals. I think that was pretty normal at the time. I was referred to as ‘plump’ as a child, as I was chubbier than the other children in the class. Looking back I wasn’t as fat as a lot of kids that you see today, in hindsight I probably wasn’t even overweight, but I remember being teased at school for being fat. I am convinced that I have body confidence issues today (and I am nearly 40!) because of that. I dreaded PE because I was no good at it, hated physical exercise, and I was always the last to be picked for teams. I got teased by the other kids because I couldn’t do handstands, cartwheels or anything else. I will never, ever forget one of the boys laughing at me with another boy and saying ‘image what she would look like naked’. I must have been about 10 years old and I was mortified. It was about that time that I got my period and needed to wear a bra which I resisted as long as I could because I hated anything that would draw attention to myself. I was so embarrassed about puberty. My mum never talked to me about it – she just got me a book from the library about periods. I never wanted anyone to look at me or my body, or to comment on it. To his day I hate it when anyone suggests I have put on or lost weight. I don’t want people to notice these things about me. When I was at university I realised that other people do exercise! Either for fun or just to keep healthy. So I started going jogging, and I’ve done so on and off ever since. I realised that I too can do exercise! I think there is much more awareness of health and the benefits of exercise than there was in the 80s. I have tried quite a lot of different types of exercise to keep myself fit. I have gone through phases of swimming, aerobics, tai chi, pilates and yoga. I have run a couple of half marathons – something unthinkable to teenage me! I have just had a baby so I haven’t done any exercise since then apart from walking. I guess as we are in a national lockdown my exercise options are limited any way. I am a healthy weight now and wear a size 10 or 12. I must admit that exercise is still a bit of a chore rather than a pleasure but it always makes me feel good afterwards and I never regret having done it. When I am able to start exercising again I think I will start by going out for a jog. I like jogging because it is free, on my doorstep, and is good for burning calories and for my cardiovascular health. I would also like to go some yoga – maybe baby yoga! – to make myself more flexible. I think this is an important aspect of health, and will be more and more important the older I get. I am already aching from picking up and holding my new baby. Muscle strength is an area I will probably neglect though I know it is important for women as they get older. Hopefully looking after the baby, moving house and decorating, and doing the gardening will be sufficient for now as it’s hard to see how I will have time for anything more than that. The reason I want to take up exercise again is not just to make sure my body is healthy, I admit that I also want to be slim. A couple of years ago I went on a strict diet, restricting the size of my meals, and I. D6958 lost a lot of weight. I loved the way I looked when I was that skinny! I would like to look like that again but I’m not sure it was really very good for me to consume so few calories. Today I really need some calories inside me to give me enough energy to look after my baby and do the housework while I am on maternity leave. Those night feeds must have increased my calorie requirements a fair bit… Even though I only gave birth 4 weeks ago I have already been on the bathroom scales – weighing in a 9 stone 7 – and I’m now officially ‘keeping an eye on my weight’. My belly is still a bit swollen after my c-section. After I’ve had my 6 week check at the doctors I will see if I can start losing some weight by having smaller portions and doing some exercise when I can find the time. It is very, very difficult to devote time to this at the moment. I am up at 7am, and don’t stop until after we’ve had dinner at 8.30pm. I am normally asleep on the sofa by 9.30pm and then I’m up at 3am to do the night feed. I suppose it is vanity that makes me want to lose weight rather than anything else to be honest. I want to be fit and healthy, but I want to be slim more than anything. I like the way my face looks when it is slimmer, and I love looking at my waist when there isn’t a roll of fat on it. A final note on body confidence. I mentioned before that I have issues with this which I think stem from comments that were made to me when I was at school. For most of my adult life I have been under the impression that I am overweight, even though the reality is that I wear a size 12 and I am not technically overweight – I am only 9 and a half stone. I have had friends talk to me seriously about the fact I think I am fatter than I am. I have been told off by them for wearing clothes that are too baggy and a size too big, because they hide my figure and make me look fat when I am not. In my mind I am wearing baggy clothes to hide my fat bits. I do hear what my friends are saying to me, I do know on some level that they are right, but on a deeper level I feel much more comfortable in my baggy clothes. It’s a strange one, maybe I will never have self-confidence when it comes to my body. I have found that if I keep my weight to 9 stone, or just under, then that is when I start to feel slim and confident. The problem is that I will struggle to reach and maintain that weight without some serious changes to my diet and exercise regime. So maybe I will always struggle with that mythical half stone I want to lose to make all the difference!"

It was not too difficult at first as we are retired and we cannot do a great deal because of my husband’s mobility issues. However it has become more depressing as time has gone on. Mainly missing grandchildren, who although are not small, are rapidly growing up and I am close to my grandson who will become a teenager later this year. I do wonder if we are growing apart, which would happen in the normal scheme of things. Have decided that we have to make the best of things and have spent more time in the garden growing vegetables. Not something I usually do but as we are tied to the house I am here to look after them which is time consuming.  Have felt more depressed in the last few weeks. My husband would like to go out but he is on the shielding list so really should not go out until June. Not that we ever did much, but it is starting to feel like house arrest. The numbers of infected people and the mortality rate has declined in recent days so that does give some hope for the future. Getting my husband’s medication delivered has been a nightmare. Decided to order online for it to be delivered by post. However the online pharmacy has been overwhelmed with order and it has been impossible to get through to them on the phone. It has literally taken hours. However they did arrive in the end and now waiting for next months order. The government Political decision making has been woeful and the news this week is that 75% of deaths may have been avoided if lockdown was introduced just a week earlier. I could not believe it when Johnson postponed lockdown citing again and again ‘the best scientific advice.’ They had only to look at what was developing in Italy to see that they needed to lockdown sooner rather than later. Time and time again they have been slow to act. Slow at cancelling incoming flights, slow at the lockdown, slow at introducing track and trace. Even the lockdown was half hearted with nothing like as stringent regulations as in some other countries. The rest of the world are looking on and are aghast as our mortality and infection rates. They are shameful. In the coming months the government will try to get the economy moving again. But people are fearful. They are trying to get schools to reopen to some year groups on the 1 June but unions and some parents are against it.  They should have negotiated a return with the input of the unions and other teaching bodies. But they didn’t. Poor communication and management. News I am reading The Guardian, The Mail on line and following news items on Twitter and Dr. John Campbell on YouTube. I also listen to BBC 1 News at Ten. I have been watching the daily news briefings. The briefings initially were a way of getting some sort of handle on what was going on in the government. However they have become mundane and repetitive. I now usually listen to BBC Radio 4 and only make an effort to watch if there’s a current issue that I am interested in. Johnson has been noticeable by his absence. In fact he is absent from all forms of media. Since I started this response, Johnson has appeared at todays briefing to defend Cummings who has been blatantly defying the lockdown rules. Johnson defense was nothing short of a car crash. There’s nothing to defend, why not just apologise and move on? But no, the arrogance of this shower is the only remarkable feature they have. There is a furious storm on Twitter. Will Cummings resign? I doubt it. I have not issues with accessing the news. Our television has the facility for audio description and also text so there should not be a problem for the vast majority of people. Work and home life. I am retired so less affected than others. Basically our way of life is not much different except we have no interaction that would normally enrich our daily lives. For instance meeting with friends or seeing family. We have also had to cancel a holiday at Easter with our grandchild. However one of our adult children has recently brought a grandchild to see us, we have been socially isolated in the garden, keeping the recommended distance. This has helped a lot. Technology Have just ordered an Alexa as this might be useful for my husband to listen to books as he can not see well enough to read. I have started a short online music course with Harvard University. Have only used WhatApp to keep in touch with adult children. Have texted grandchildren and spoken to them over the phone. I use Facebook to keep in touch with local groups and it has been very useful for local information. I have also joined a couple of Facebook gardening groups. I guess the only people in the world who would be a bit interested in my photos of roses. I have started with Instagram but don’t use it a great deal as the moment. Shopping/food Getting online delivery slots took a lot of time initially. As my husband is being shielded I decided to avoid shops altogether. Before lockdown I did ensure that the store cupboard had enough to get us through an initial couple of weeks. It is still impossible to get self raising flour for some reason. I think that I am baking more, as we cannot go out, but not a great deal as you just end up eating more than you would need. I am buying a fruit and veg box from a local farm that is delivered to the door and the produce is very fresh. The only problem is that you get what’s in the box so don’t get to choose what you would like. Had artichokes this week which I would usually avoid. By the time you have finished prepping there’s little left and they don’t seem worth the effort. Entertaining/leisure Well I have mentioned gardening and the online short music course. I did intend to read more but this has not happened. I do keep busy and rarely sit down during the day. I have a dog and walk with her every day and now we are allowed to go out as often as we would like so I am taking her for a short walk later too. I also like to paint and have bought a couple of books online to give some inspiration and new dimension. Personal hygiene I did stop washing my hair every day and left it to every other day. However it makes me feel even more depressed when it’s a mess so I have resumed daily washing in the shower. Apart from that habits are the same. The main this is not being able to visit a hairdresser! Our local salon owner posted on Facebook that she was taking bookings for when they re-open. I put my name down so hopefully will have to get a cut when they are back in business. I would guess that would be in July. I bought some hairclippers for my husband when all this first started. He did have a very short crop but it has grown back. I think that he’s a bit wary of me having another go, but it is getting a bit long again. Sleep I have long term problems with sleep but I have had a couple of nights when I just have been able to get back to sleep at all. This is very unusual. I have not been having nightmares. I did dream that I was on holiday with my grandchildren, in a beautiful part of the world and I was taking some photos. I haven’t seen some of them for 3 months and I am missing them. I felt deeply melancholic when I woke as it was such a contrast with the happiness in the dream."

Last occupation Craft Shop Owner Health We have had no physical health issues during the lock down period and have not required any medical or professional help. My emotions have been mixed over the last three or four weeks mainly because I feel getting back to 'normal' is never going to happen. It is quite frightening to have nameless fears with no reassurance of an end point. I think we have forgotten that we can live without fear. At first it was a novel experience staying at home but tension seems to have increased now we are coming out of lockdown. I don't like the way that people (mostly strangers) are physically keeping their distance, stepping off the pavement and avoiding eye contact. There is such an air of suspicion and general nervousness. It feels as if our whole world has shrunk to nothing. I worry that we will not be able to live as freely as we once did. Everything seems to have changed completely in such a comparatively short time. Sometimes it's hard not to feel depressed and panicky. I don't feel worried and depressed just for myself, although it has curtailed a lot of the things we hoped to do in retirement, but more for the future of my children and grandchildren. How will life be for them in the future? The Government The government information has been confusing in that all the countries of the UK are not working together. In Scotland we are on a different timescale for emerging from lockdown. It seems unlikely that the leaders of neighbouring countries which have no physical borders should be so different in their viewpoints and choices. There has been too much general information which appears not to have been honed down to workable practices. I would have liked to see the Prime Minister and First Ministers working together to present a united front. I feel I am not qualified to comment on most of the political decisions that have been made. It has been an enormous challenge for them all and, as they keep telling us, we are all in this together. Whatever political decisions have been made will hopefully have been the right decisions at the time. It would have been more reassuring if the decisions made had been cross-party decisions. Now, if ever, is the time for a coalition government. I imagine that the government will be basing their next decisions on re-booting the economy. I hope the emphasis on protecting the NHS will continue and the social welfare aspects will not be forgotten. Education may well be in for a complete overhaul and employment and benefits and travel will undoubtedly be on the agenda. I have no idea how the government will cope with it all. News Wherever I have lived, either in England or Scotland, I feel the news is always London-centric. If it isn't happening in London it isn't happening! City dwelling is vastly different to rural dwelling or living in smaller towns and cities and each presents different problems. Journalists, whether writing for BBC, ITV, SKY, or any of the other news channels or daily newspapers are mainly commenting and reporting on what happens in the capital. Regional news takes second place and is usually patronising. I read a national newspaper daily and watch the main news on television. I do not rely on social media for news apart from information on Facebook posted by our community council and a Facebook page for our local volunteers. These Facebook pages have been informative and unbiased and tell us things we need to know. I have occasionally watched the 5pm daily government briefing broadcasts but do not watch them regularly. There is often too much conflicting information between what is happening in England and what is happening in Scotland. I don't support the SNP but Nicola Sturgeon's broadcasts are clearer, relevant and more concise. I do not know anyone who has experienced difficulty accessing news but I would definitely support the use of a BSL interpreter. Work and Home Life My husband and myself are both retired so we have no work practices which have been affected. A life unencumbered by working hours is entirely different. You have to make your own structure for your daily life so what was in place for us needed little adaptation. I did notice that my husband re-structured his day by being in his workshop almost on a 9-5 basis as if he was in an office job! My day, whether in lockdown or not, is structured anyway around mealtimes, washing and cleaning. Although the impact on our home life has been minimal, the biggest difficulty has been not seeing our daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren regularly. We have been unable to see them as we would normally have done for outings, birthdays and social occasions or helped with childcare. This has been a strain on us and them. We were not able to help much with home schooling either. The educational aspect of lockdown has been worrying for us all. Although we live only 15 miles apart we have stuck to the rules throughout but the lack of their physical presence has been challenging. Having relatives and friends living abroad has also been distressing, knowing that we are not free to travel. We have no pets currently but have considered getting a dog. Technology Keeping in touch with family and friends had been mainly by telephone, texts, WhatsApp or video calls via Facebook or Facetime. This was not new to us so it has not been difficult. We have used Zoom regularly, at least once a week for Craft Club meetings, Book Group meetings and Rotary Club meetings. Zoom was new to us but we have found it easy to use and very ueful. We will probably continue to use it in the future. We have never used Twitter or Instagram. Shopping and food During lockdown we reduced our weekly shopping food trip to shopping about every 10 or 14 days. For the first four or five weeks my husband went out to do the shopping so that I need not go out. I was not officially medically shielding but as I had just had major surgery a few months ago we felt it was better for me to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Eventually we went back to me doing the shopping and we now often go together. No food shopping has been done on line and we have used our usual supermarkets. We didn't stockpile as we keep a reasonable store of tinned and frozen food as we live in a rural community with no local shops apart from a small convenience store. A variety of local suppliers, baker, milk man, butcher, fishmonger, garden centre and farm shop all arranged deliveries to our village. Most deliveries were free or the businesses made a small charge. We used the butcher and farm shop for fresh meat and vegetables a few times to support local businesses and the garden centre for seeds and compost. Normally we would not have used deliveries but we appreciated the efforts local tradespeople made to keep their businesses going. We found that we ate more than usual and never skipped a meal, presumably because we were confined to the house and had more time to spend on cooking and eating. Every meal was a social occasion! Because we were at home more we watched more television in the evenings and also had more snacks, i.e. crisps or nuts. Normally we have a healthy diet but found we were eating more 'comfort foods' such as cakes and puddings. It felt as though cooking or baking was sometimes the main (or only) achievement of the day. There were very few occasions when we missed meals because we were in a hurry or had something better to do. We were never in a hurry and rarely had something better to do! Entertainment and Leisure We have done many, many DIY jobs during lockdown. Unfortunately they were not always the ones that were necessary or important but mainly small jobs such as sanding and repainting a cupboard, repairing a chair, painting kitchen stools, re-organising and rearranging my sewing room and my husband's workshop. The big projects which we were hoping to do included building an en suite shower room, refurbishing an old bathroom and replacing the kitchen. Plans were in place to do all these but it was impossible to obtain building materials or to employ the necessary tradesmen. They are still waiting to be started and it has been and still is, a constant source of frustration and dissatisfaction as we haven't been able to complete these house renovations. They are still waiting and although we can now get building supplies we can't get anyone to do the work. If we could have done it ourselves we would have but we don't have the necessary skills. Almost every evening before dinner my husband and I have had a perpetual challenge game of Rumicub, a board game that we usually play with the family. We have done crosswords daily but no jigsaws or computer games. We have enjoyed sharing more conversation as we have had more time to talk to each other. My husband has done some model railway modelling and I have completed some old unfinished projects of crochet and embroidery plus learning new skills of gel plate printing and watercolour painting. Luckily we had most of the equipment needed for those hobbies -purchased long before lockdown -so there have been a few little creative triumphs. Photo attached of an embroidery started and finished during lockdown with appropriate annotation! Our exercise level has remained much the same apart from doing much more gardening than usual, including growing more vegetables than we would normally grow (an underlying worry about possible shortages of food!) We have been watching more or less the same type of television programmes that we would normally watch, dramas, thrillers, quiz games, etc. and pretty soon we started actively avoiding programmes about corona virus. There was far too much conflicting information on the pandemic to disseminate and much of it was very frightening when you are isolated from family and friends. We began to feel very useless and ineffectual sitting at home. The radio (BBC radio 2) is on all day and the BBC have been excellent in their programme content apart from the Jeremy Vine show which has been composed of more than the usual ignorant and sensationalist content. That particular programme contributed a great deal to cause me stress and worry with its constant and unremitting daily focus on the downside of Covid-19. Reading material has not changed from the usual fiction although I have read far less than normal. I have no idea why as it has always been my way of relaxation. Perhaps subconsciously I couldn't let myself relax. Lockdown has caused a lot of tension. Personal hygiene I don't think this has really changed. My daily personal care routine has been comforting -one thing that has not been affected by lockdown. Hair care has been difficult as I wear my hair short and I'm desperate to have it cut into a decent style again. I've chopped bits off! My husband has grown a beard, which I really dislike. He says he will shave it off when the pubs open. I can't wait! I gave him a haircut so he looked less like a hobo. He complained. Sleep Neither of us had had a particular problem with sleeping during lockdown. We have had a lot of fresh air (mostly when gardening) and have occupied ourselves without being bored. Generally we have tried to achieve something positive every day which seems to have helped. Both of us have had more dreams than usual but none really disturbing and no nightmares. I have lain awake longer than usual several times but that has been mainly due to the light summer nights. I actively try not to worry irrationally at night and use relaxation techniques and listen to music if I need to get to sleep."

Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person.

Wellbeing is an element of health its how you feel holistically, how you feel in your mind as well as your body ­and the two are interlinked/interdependent Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Well yes being a woman medical issues from periods and their effects onwards eg on how you felt mood swings, emotional etc and you just learn to get on with it. My pregnancy was reasonably well supported and I had choices and an excellent health visitor for my first baby -but postnatal depression was tough and felt shameful and I hid it from everyone as did other friends and then we get to the menopause its effects on daily quality of life are not widely shared and understood by women never mind the wider world and so the problems that can cause are not widely recognised eg brain fog etc so things like HRT commentary focuses on the health risks but misses the conversation about the detrimental effects of the menopause on quality of life. I now understand from books and research that the male bias is a major issue even with things as vital as the symptoms of heart attack but many other areas of medical science too. The world is understood better from a male point of view Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? My parents were quite matter of fact about health, particularly my mother is very open. My father was a dentist so health was an obvious element of our lives, eating well, cleaning our teeth etc. Eating properly, doing exercise, having regular baths etc were all part of our lives but we were also campers and had a boat where we had to go from marina to anchorage and use various sparse facilities I think this taught us how lovely showers were too!! We all used to read shared teen magazines as I remember reading bits in there that taught me things eg I remember an advert for underarm hair removal cream and deodorants! Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? My mum was always very open she bought us a book called “Where did I come from?” (Which my youngest child was obsessed with in his turn and carried around with him for months!) she also talked to us and she made sure I had sanitary towels in my school bag or on trips whenever I went away. My first period started on the cross channel ferry back from a 4 day trip to France with my school and of course my bag was locked in the coach so we had to find a teacher who of course had none as she used Tampons I think she found a machine on the ferry. I remember mum buying my first bra pale green barely a bra more 2 triangles and soon outgrown and I remember asking my mum to buy me immac to remove underarm hair but she did not know what I was talking about so I think I pinched her razor! I remember them with a little discomfort as facing things that made you more grown up was mildly embarrassing with grown ups but not a problem. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I did not consciously do much about any of it until I was older, mental health was not something I was aware of although when my brother died of course that affected my mental health and that of those around me and it took a long time to find a balance again. Postnatal depression and then dealing with parenthood and its responsibilities and then started to read a lot and I also learned through an OU degree about childhood anxieties etc and the psychology in the course. I walked a lot with children and dog and took up running and then as I go older had more injuries have added pilates, rowing and cycling -for physical and mental wellbeing and as I have got older been more aware of the benefits for my self in all areas so I walk every day and I also practice mindfulness. I hope I continue to be aware but I try not to turn every twinge into hypochondria Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? If you feel you look rubbish by whatever judgement yours or others you will feel less well mentally and physically because it affects it your own perception of what’s ok. I think teenagers are always influenced by impressions of the perfections of others. This does carry on as adults, its hard not to see yourself as a lesser version of the perfect people in whatever stage of life you are at; the relaxation of getting older is that this does matter less, acceptance of what you are helps. Currently my HRT gel is pretty essential as although I am on a very low dose its effect on memory and tiredness is startling. Otherwise a face moisturiser and lip salve! Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? My Dad was in the RAF so when we lived on the RAF station he always got his uniform on, his hat was on the hall table and he would wear his grey badged jumper on normal days (full dress uniform for some evening formal dining evenings or formal events). When we lived in England and in German off base the IRA risk was high so Dad could not travel in uniform or in anything identified and I also remember him checking under the car every morning for bombs when I was a teenager. Mum always looked smart going out of the door and we were always aware “we were representing Dad” so we had to look smart on base! They both still look smart just going to the shops, Dad never goes out without a comb and a hanky in his back pocket and mum smart. If she has an event she puts her hair in rollers and so on. Her hair was always important although she was never a super vain woman she just always looked well dressed and smart. She still wears the same perfume and wears makeup but appropriate to the time of day and skilfully applied. My Dad has always relied on my Mum to lay out his clothes and still does I am not sure he ever gets to chose his own clothes and as day time was uniform evening and weekends apart from garden clothes was and is defined by my Mum! I always wear earrings although I work outside as a Forest School teacher, I do wear a touch of make up -unless its raining when its pointless! As I have changed jobs my ‘uniform’ has changed from suits and hair in a bun, light make up perfume and a briefcase to appropriate smart but practical clothes for being a TA to good quality outdoor clothes able to deal with all the weather and conditions in a practical but professional looking way. But always earrings and usually matching jewellery necklace/earrings. I used to wear perfume but some children are very sensitive to smells and now I work with more SEN children I am aware this can affect their ability to relate to you. I try to buy cosmetics, perfume, shampoo, conditioner, and clothes that are low impact, low environmental impact minimal packaging etc etc Please post your response to: Freepost: RTGU-AYJE-YSSC, The Mass Observation Archive, The Keep, Woollards Way, Brighton, BN1 9BP (please note that the MOA team are currently working from home and unable to respond to directives sent by post) or by email to: moa@sussex.ac.uk.

Mass-Observer B7084 describes themself as female; age 62; married; retired senior research fellow.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Autumn directive 2020 MO number B7084 Female Married Portland Retired senior research fellow Part 2 I have thought about what health means a lot in my professional capacity and have integrated my academic explorations into my personal view of health. I have a broad definition, encompassing physical, mental and social aspects. I recall something a professor said about the best health encompassing the ability to be involved in your society. I think of it as a kind of vibrancy, physical, mental and social. I don’t see wellbeing as separate from health so would not necessarily employ another definition for it. I might add that ell being would encompass the conditions needed for good health, such as economic security or freedom from racism, for example. A healthy body: strong, flexible, nimble, well-functioning, free of disease. I picture a magazine image of a woman in sports clothing, lifting weights, smiling, with glowing healthy-looking skin. I also picture the faces of mature women organisers of an online environmental forum I visit, sparkling eyes, again ‘glowing’, looking confident and happy. I think my experience of health has been influenced by all the factors mentioned. Those I am most aware of are my gender and class (and also the age I grew up in). I remember being aware of health as quite a young child, maybe 4 years old, with visits to the local health clinic where we’d be given vaccinations, supplies of cod liver oil and orange juice. It left me with a feeling that my health and that of the other children was important. I felt that my parents had primary responsibility for my health but also the early welfare state. I recall a felling of personal responsibility for it too when I was a little older. We had the community dental team come to our council estate school and give a talk on dental health. There was also a poster about it in the school corridor. These things left me feeling I could care for my own teeth, prevent fillings and knew how to do so. I recall my parents talking to me about particular health conditions I experienced (e.g., tonsillitis, squint) and the need to visit the doctor or spend time in hospital. I don’t recall them talking about physical health in the wider sense or the need to stay healthy. We did mostly lead what would be considered physically healthy lives though, especially getting lots of exercise outside and walking for miles. I recall parental conversations which could be categorised as around emotional health, how to deal with friendship challenges, for example. I recall having conversations with my older sisters and friends at school about reproductive health, such as menstruation, gaining knowledge from those conversations rather than from parental talks… Autumn Directive 2020 MO number B7084 Female Married Portland Retired senior research fellow Part 2 continued …or books. We were also taught the mechanics of reproduction in biology classes in senior school and learned information about a balanced diet and how to cook it in home economics classes. I became aware of bodily changes associated with puberty while at junior school, but didn’t understand very much about them. I think having my first period and wearing a bra felt important to me, also learning about personal freshness when I reached adolescence, e.g., using a deodorant. I think I felt a bit bewildered and embarrassed by these experiences as I got the knowledge and information I needed once they’d happened rather than being prepared in advance. I’ve been fairly active in trying to maintain my health. I’ve been a runner and now walk long distances regularly. I take advantage of screening opportunities, keep well informed about health issues and take health professional advice when needed. I spend time on nature and swim in the sea. I also seek counselling support for my mental health when circumstances mean it’s helpful. I take especial care over my mental health since suffering the adverse effects of stress a few years ago, resulting in a period of depression and anxiety. I am more careful about making commitments and try to put my own needs equal to those of other people. I ensure I have time to do the things that I find fulfilling and express myself creatively. I think more about maintaining my health as I get older. I hope to remain healthy into old age and am willing to do what I can to achieve it (even if it isn’t always easy to stick with healthy habits!). I get information about health from books, magazines, health professionals and the internet. I’m careful about sources and check whether something has any evidence base before I make my mind up about it. I think I’m more aware of the functioning of my body now but less personally aware of body image and pressures to conform to beauty stereotypes. I think I feel more comfortable with how I look along with being more aware of the great advantages of a well-functioning body. I think as I get older my general approach to health and well being will be the same as it is now I am a mature woman, but I will likely have particular health considerations relating to ageing. As I described earlier, I think there are aspects of physical appearance that can give indications of good health but they are not necessarily the conventional stereotypes of youth and beauty. I’m sure I was influenced by popular ideas of beauty when I was a young woman. I recall watching the Miss World competition with my family and joining in with the judging of the women’s appearances. B7084 Looking at old photos I can see how slim and attractive I looked but I didn’t realise it at the time, being more inclined to focus on perceived faults. It’s hard to say how far my parents were influenced by these ideals, but they must have been, given the society they grew up in. Our dad used to tell us how beautiful we were, though our mum could be critical about our personal appearance or choice of clothes. I think I would least like to do without shampoo. I hate having unwashed hair, it feels unpleasant on my head. This might be a bit influenced by the fact that my hair needs washing and I’ll be doing it shortly! My parents didn’t go out a great deal, but when they did, I recall my mum putting on her foundation, blusher and coral coloured lipstick. It was quite a ceremony in front of the mirror above the fireplace. I seem to recall the scent of the cosmetics and a general feeling of excitement in the air."

Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Things concerned with whether or not I can lead a meaningful life. If I have good health, then I am able physically and mentally to do what I want to do. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Balance, ability, strength, at ease Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. A red squirrel – agile, nimble, speedy, curious, independent.  Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I really can’t think of anything specific to these alone. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Around the time my sister was born – was I was five. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? My parents and a grandma and the GP. S7094 Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Yes, Mum had full-blown migraines occasionally so I knew about those. I had my first pretty young and was cared for and knew the symptoms. I remember learning about a small baby when my sister was born – so, things like how to hold her with care. I had bowel problems when little, so I remember being talked to about that and knowing about fibre. I remember knowing grandma had a weak heart, so could not have an op and so had to have weekly treatment for her prolapsed womb – she’d had six kids. I knew my aunt was the last person in York to die of dyptheria in York in 1944. I knew my grandfather had nearly died of septicaemia after an industrial accident in the 1930s and was never fully healthy again. I knew my great-uncle had dementia after a stroke and hospitalisation. I knew my aunt had cancer. When my grandma died young of heart disease and there was healthy eating on TV, then I remember Mum talking about skimmed milk etc and putting us onto it – but I was a teenager by then. There was stuff about health and healthy eating in school lessons. Mum spoke to me about pregnancy when my periods started, but then I think we’d done all that in school by then. We had vaccinations in school too and these were explained. And the nit nurse, of course, so we had to wash our hair! Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? Don’t remember talking about it with friends, though one friend’s mother was always on this or that diet, which I found odd. See above for school – yes! Dentist and nit nurse in primary school, vaccinations in secondary, health in home economics, biology, PHSE, form time etc. Key moments S7094 As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? About the age of 12. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? Yes, first bra and period starting, yes voice breaking. There were no others among my friends that I was aware of. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Embarrassed as I got my first bra quite late and it was uncomfy. First period was not a big thing. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Exercise and a healthy diet. I was not good at sport at school, but found out via Guides and DofE that being active made me feel good – stamina exercise, so I started running and long-distance walking and rowing. I rowed at univ and then did not at first on starting work, then decided I was not going to let fitness drop, so I started rowing again. Then, when I became a teacher I didn’t have time for rowing, but again, I made the decision to keep up exercise as I liked feeling fit and strong. Now I have to be more careful with getting injured, but I still go for it, esp in holidays. My ideal summer holiday has exercise in and around a freshwater lake among big mountains every day. Physical and mental go together quite a lot. The strenuous stamina exercise clears my head and gets me out of it too. I eat really well and am lucky to really enjoy and be able to afford modest quantities of really good quality food. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Internet and NHS and sister (a doctor) S7094 Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? No change, I think, though it has changed! In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I’ll need to take more care to avoid injury to keep active. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Not really. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? I’m sure I have been, yes. But not excessively so. When I was a teenager I was aware of not being naturally stick thin, but as I have got older I have stayed as I was then. I really don’t care about outside appearances much and tend not to notice it in others. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Mum has a thin about being overweight, but that’s related to two false hips. Dad not at all, at all! Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Basic deodorant is nice for all of us – the past must have been very smelly. Hand-cream if I am outside a lot just to avoid painful hands. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Yes and no for daytime. Evening, mum would wear make-up and put on perfume. S7094 What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Work: get up, splash face, dressed, have breakfast, leave. Socialising: change to whatever clothes make sense for the occasion and head out.

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? All fine. Occasionally a sense of ‘this is all a bit weird’ and a bit ‘blue’ about being restricted, but passing light, grey, small clouds. Sometimes a bit listless Mostly fine and sometimes really enjoying it. Loving the quiet and the gorgeous spring and the freedom. Definitely a sense of how privileged we are to have a nice home, each other, open space near us, work that can be done from home, relatively secure jobs, hardly any mortgage, so much access to art and culture, lots to do, people who need us and are in touch with us. Sense of sadness about the way this is so hard for some people and that it did not have to be like this. Sense of great sadness at the way that this is exposing all the problems in society – inequality etc. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? Made too late, showing incompetence, huge lack of regard for people and what really matters, unimaginative, bone-headed, party political, egotistical, inadequate… I confess that I knew Johnson was a stuffed shirt, but I thought he might at least be good at communications – but no. The contrast with Angela Merkel, Jacinda Adern and even Emmanuel Macron he is quite something. TheCabinetareabunchofpeople whowouldjustsay ‘yes’toBrexit,sotheyhavebeen as useless as I had expected. Rishi Sunak seems to have some more talent, but is very inexperienced. This was never going to be easy and I really am glad I am not in power, but the mess we are now in has been hugely created by the lazy, neglectful, incompetence of the Johnson brigade. They have got us into a huge mess and I have no idea how we’re now going to get out of it. I expect them to continue to be reactive – and too late. They expect they will lose control again and there will be more spikes in infection. I expect they will try to dump the blame away from themselves as much as possible. I expect they will have to keep propping up the economy despite themselves. I expect they will lurch between faux-stiff upper lip and panic and that the fabric of society will be further damaged, many lives lost and livelihoods ruined. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? Starting with the last one – yes, these briefings should be fully accessible. Typical that they are not! I sometimes listen on R4. (You’ve just reminded me there might be one on now!) They were important to institute and replaced the shambles of the early days. Now they are trying to manipulate them so that they do not get questioned by people who have much knowledge. They are also too often full of bluster or platitudes. Clear, honest communication is vital and that’s lapsing again. BBC website, Guardian website, leading journalists and political commentators picked up via Twitter, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, sometimes journal articles such as Spectator and New Statesman, bits of local media (YorkMix etc). Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I am still working at home. Hours have been longer. It’s harder to get the work done in a reasonable time as jobs take longer, it’s harder to communicate with students and colleagues, the pastoral need is greater and takes more time, it’s hard to learn new digital skills fast to get things working online. There’s been some great creativity in terms of online CPD for teachers. I have enjoyed the challenge of creating something meaningful for teacher trainees. Overall, though, work is more admin and less of the satisfying parts. I am loving seeing so much of my husband. He’s my best friend and we get to have coffee, lunch etc together. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have been using many. I have to use them all day for work. I am attending courses from work to help me learn to use them for next year. Having done the basics, we now need to get more sophisticated in how we teach. There’s been lots more of many and I have been on things like Facebook (which I detest) in order to pick up with some people. The last thing I like doing is contacting friends and family digitally after staring at a screen all day, but needs must. We’ve had drinks with friends online. Overall, I find it a very pale shadow of the real contact. However, I’ve always hated telephoning people, so may not be typical! Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? We have been able to carry on getting local deliveries from independent shops. We go to pick things up at an appointed time and do deliveries for other people, including people isolating. It seemed as though it might not have been possible for a while, but people have adapted. There is even now flour. My husband is a keen amateur chef with considerable talent and he has been putting his creative energies into cooking. We are not eating more, but it’s amazing -try fresh pasta made with wild garlic, or homemade ravioli with sorrel, or ox cheek marinated and served with caponata and polenta! We are drinking a bit less as we are still usually just having a drink at weekends and we might have had a dinner party with friends and therefore drunk more. With just the two of us we drink a bit less -nice quality wine and proper real ale, though! Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had hoped to have some time to do more, but do not. I have continued playing my violin, though lessons are not so much fun over Zoom. I am still doing daily German on Duolingo, as I was before, to refresh my knowledge. I bought the Hilary Mantel novel before lockdown and am enjoying it. We are pleased that Series 3 of Babylon Berlin is out, but have got back to Series 1 and 2 before getting to it. I have tidied out a couple of cupboards that needed it. My husband is still doing his allotment. Exercise is a bit harder as my back is not so good with all the desk work, so I have done a bit of yoga, which I hate. Running and a bit of cycling, the rowing machine and some walking remain the usual exercise. We have enjoyed some of the National Theatre live and RSC repeats. As the weather has mostly been so lovely we have been outside on the front bench and seen lots more of the neighbours as we can all socially distance easily in our terraced front houses. We have got around to getting some plants for the pots in the backyard and at the front as we are here a bit more and someone local was selling plants to make some money. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? We both dress for work still jeans, but a smarter top. Not much has changed, though my husband is clipping his own hair and mine is just getting ridiculously thatch like, but who cares! I am not someone who spends long on anything like hair and beauty. Nothing really has changed, I would say. We do try to be very conscious of washing out hands on returning home if we have been out, but we hardly go out. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Ah no, I have always been an excellent, heavy sleeper and this continues. I might have had a dream connected with not having an outlet for creativity a few weeks back, so I made sure to do some more creative work."

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health . Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. K goes for long cycle rides along wonderfully empty roads at weekends, I have an online yoga class once a week. We take short evening walks around the block and along the canal towpath, admiring the roses in neighbouring front gardens. . Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. K had a small facial skin procedure under local anaesthetic, carried out with full PPE. I periodically have problems with my ears, which wax up so that I am to some extent deaf: they have been gradually waxing up and are in addition rather itchy, but it seems too minor a matter to bother our GP. . How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? I don’t normally keep a journal except on trips etc, and I thought of lockdown as a similar discrete period, [though as time goes on and it extends itself imperceptibly I am no longer so sure] so it seemed worth keeping a record, to note changes of mood and activities: I sometimes wonder though whether the examined life is another word for endless navel-gazing. I feel generally restless and unsettled. The events in the headlines and news broadcasts seem rather far away, like the sound of distant gunfire. I am unlikely to catch the virus and if I catch it I am unlikely to die of it. The likelihood of a disabling stroke at my age is the same as before the virus, namely more likely and more unpredictable than catching the virus and the consequences more serious: If I die of the virus then I die, but the effects on my family of a disabling stroke would be drastic. Ones thoughts are so filled with the death and infection figures that one forgets that 50,000 deaths, awful though they are, represent a minute proportion of the population. Of course there should not be any deaths at all, and there would be fewer if we had a more responsible government. The Government . What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Unprintable. Words fail me. Half of me cant bear to think about it, part of me obsessively thinks of nothing else. Many of the measures seem to be taken for short-term political gain, since the scientific opinion is divided. . What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? It will bash through some hard-Brexit measures, assuming probably correctly that the public is too exhausted and bemused by CoVid19 to notice. It seems already clear that concern for economic activity trumps concern for public health. Boris Johnson is taking advantage of the social distancing rules to emasculate parliament, by making it impossible to meet. News . Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Primarily newspapers: the FT weekend and the Guardian/Observer daily. Sometimes the Channel l4 news at 7 . Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. No, I don’t think I could bear to watch. They would make me too angry . Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a serious problem about credibility on all fronts. . There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I hadn’t heard about it, but I think it would be an excellent initiative. Another example of how the Scots are more sensitive and resilient than we are in these matters. Work and home life . Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. Both K and I are retired, with adequate pensions, so there are no financial problems. He is a retired academic and continues to work on his research with all the time in the world, now that conferences etc are being cancelled. He misses being able to go into libraries, but is amazed by what is available through remote data bases. . How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? Life inside the house is pretty unaffected, but we miss eating out, concerts and seeing friends and family, especially grandchildren. We are fortunate that we find each other congenial and stimulating company. However, if we did not have each other, we might well be rather lonely. . We find that what we miss most are impromptu, unpredictable and random moments. Going into the city for meetings etc used to involve browsing in bookshops, window-shopping, coffee or lunch, unexpected meeting with acquaintances etc. Shopping on line is no substitute: ordering a specific book through abe books is not the same as browsing the local Oxfam bookshop. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? . Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re­connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I sit on the broads of several charities which have needed emergency meetings, so I have learned fast to use Zoom and conference calls. I was amazed and angered to see how much these conference calls can cost participants, and one of my charities has been slow to recognize these charges as expenses like travel costs. Not having to factor in travelling time and costs for attending meetings is a huge advantage, but there is a loss of informal personal contact before and after discussion which is a pity. . It is also quite disconcerting to see oneself on a Zoom screen: every wrinkle and hair out of place is magnified : “ can this old crone be ME?”. Other people’s backgrounds can be very distracting. I want to tell one of my yoga classmates who does her exercises in her bedroom “Please could you shut your wardrobe door?” . Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I didn’t use social media before and haven’t considered doing so now. Shopping and food . What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? We haven’t been doing any bulk/panic buying. I am making a point of using small shops rather than supermarkets as I think they need support more. However, there was a time when the only place to buy a new supply of tights was M&S, because clothes shops were considered non-essential. K, who makes our bread, had problems getting yeast at a time when half the nation started baking, but that phase passed . Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? Unconnected with lockdown, I have been making an effort to cook/eat more fish and vegetables and less meat, so I have gone on doing that. I upgraded the size of my weekly veg box. I try every week to cook something out of the weekend cookery supplements by way of variety. We have also been ordering a weekly takeaway from the gastropub at the end of our road, to help keep it in business. I spend more time thinking about food, partly because I have to think about lunch as well, but also because cooking is a pleasant creative activity. We eat in a very relaxed style, eating and reading and talking all at the same time, so our table manners are deteriorating. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? . No new hobbies, skills or games. A lot of gardening: clearing overgrown climbers for the first time in 10 years, repotting house and courtyard plants and making another attempt at a herb garden. The garden is a great pleasure this spring: when did we last have two months of almost uninterrupted fine weather? So many plants have flowered their full length, instead of being rained out half way though their blossoming time, especially paeonies. Roses have had a very good year. There has been time to notice how long the period of developing buds lasts compared with the short period of full flowering. We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. . I have a zoom session once a week with an elderly friend who has recovered enough from a recent stroke to have conquered Zoom and to be comfortable with it. We have read Penelope Lively’s book on gardening and her memoir of childhood. Also Lucy Mangan’s Bookworm. We started Kim, but she found the plot too complicated, so we have now taken up Just So Stories. . K read his way through Luther’s translation of the New Testament and made notes on it. He is an atheist with professional interest in the German Enlightenment. I am a cradle Anglican, now a recovering Christian and a Quaker attender. I am reading my way through the King James NT and we are reading a chapter of the NRSV aloud each evening. It is instructive to see how the whole work hangs together and how many parts are never read aloud in the lectionary, [and sometimes it is clear why not] so one actually knows it much less well than one thinks. Also I have been reading alongside it Dairmaid McCullogh’s Christianity, which has been very illuminating . . My pre-publication copy of Hilary Mantel’s The mirror and the light arrived just before lockdown, and I started again from the beginning of Wolf Hall, rivetted all the way through, even though the third volume is more discursive and prolix. Alongside them I read McCullogh’s biography of Thomas Cromwell – fascinating comparisons. After that, I re-read Prescott’s The man on a donkey: very impressive and moving in a completely different way from Mantel and McCullogh, less interested in the political manoeuvres and more in the spiritual and mystical life of her characters. Finally I re-read Ford Madox Ford’s The fifth queen and found I had almost totally forgotten it: under all the tushery and Godwottery it is vivid and convincing. All the novels use the same state papers as McCullogh, so many of the scenes are repeated verbatim but show very different emphases. And although one knows that Katharine Howard was completely different from the way Ford portrays her, and although one knows that Prescott’s characters cannot possibly have known about Julian of Norwich , one is still moved by the quotations. . When I needed a bit of comfort reading I went back and did all the Antonia Forest series about the Marlows and the wartime novels by Angela Thirkell – oddly similar to today in that people are coping with changes in regulations sometimes at short notice, and have the feeling that the real action is going on elsewhere. . We watched the RSC Othello on livestream. I saw Hugh Quarshie play Othello 45 years ago when he was an undergraduate, so it roused many memories. A very interesting production. The Iago was also black, but nothing was made of this in the production’s treatment: the RSC has had a commendable policy of colour-blind casting for many years and this makes a discreet way of flagging up other ways of looking at the racism. . We have watched again several series from the 1980s: Behaving Badly, The jewel in the crown and Fortunes of war Personal hygiene . We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? My hair has not been cut since the end of January, as my immune-compromised visiting hairdresser stopped taking customers even before lockdown, and she wont begin again until early July, so I look about as untrimmed as my hedge. We try not to slob about, but there is a strong temptation each morning after showering just to put on the clothes one took off the night before. Sleep . There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Sometimes, I have narrative dreams like watching a film, these days the dreams are more obviously like working through visual and verbal material taken in from outside, like data. I rarely remember anything on waking."

THANK YOU. Spring Directive 2020 Part 2: COVID-19 Update In Dublin, my great-uncle, who is suffering from leukaemia, was rushed to hospital for stomach pains. He contracted coronavirus while on a ward with two men who had the disease. he has now been hospitalised for two weeks, but, strangely, has no symptoms. He has been tested for the virus – and has definitely got it. But apparently he has a very rare blood type, which – supposedly – protects him from falling severely ill. Currently, he is receiving chemotherapy for a tumour in his bowels; if he were to suddenly develop dangerous coronavirus symptoms, I don’t think he will survive. From mygrandad, I hear mygreat-uncle is maintaining astrong and optimistic mentality, “must’n’grumble” is his catchphrase! My mum’s friend, who is in her forties, lost her mother and abrother eight months ago. Two weeks ago, her other brother died from a heart attack. She travelled over to Dublin to be with her family and has not yet returned. Being separated from family members is the hardest struggle under lockdown, especially if relatives are suffering. At home, living has become claustrophobic, with everyday being Groundhog Day. I rise and sleep at the same time, eat at the same time, and do the same menial tasks over and over, occasionally go out for a walk or a run. Tensions are beginning to run high at home, withpettysquabbles breaking out over cleaning/cooking/shopping. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so long in one place with my family. I think the government has been slow to establish the lockdown and to increase testing for keyworkers and those with symptoms, especiallyin Wales. And the government’s message to ‘stayat home’ and ‘stayalert’ has been completely undermined bythe activities of Dominic Cummings. It’s one rule for them, and another for the rest. In the coming months, I think the government will attempt to pick themselves up fromCummings’ blunder – and mostly continue as ifthere wasn’t a complete disregard for the rules!They’ll expect the public to continue to follow their orders, but I think tensions are beginning to run high (I heard in the news of a party broken up in London over the weekend; and tensions are certainlyrunning high in America). I don’t think Cummings will resign – or be sacked. I think we’llbegin to see in England non-essential shops to reopen soon. Idon’t want this to happen in Wales; I think it’s far too soon and fear a second peak occurring. Expecting the whole public to adhere to the two-meter distance rule while outside just won’t work. The lockdown should continue until at least mid-July. I’m beginning to feela bit frustrated bythe news. Iused to regularly watch the government’s 5pmbriefings and interviews on BBC Breakfast but I’mbeginning to feeldisheartened by whatever they’re saying. I don’t have confidence in Downing Street. The dailyrising death tolldoesn’t inspire pride in the government’s actions;I’m horrified to discover the UK’s peak deaths was one of the highest in Europe –and considering we’re a tiny landmass compared to Italy and Spain. I felt reassured by the government when the UK first went into lockdown, now I’m fed up with their messages. England’s urge to ‘stayalert’ is an arbitraryconcept; it provides no real sense of action to the public. Is the public meant to be looking over their shoulders to check if coronavirus isn’t spying on them fromanearbybuilding?Behind America, I’m relieved I don’t live in England. Wales continuing with lockdown makes me feel slightly reassured. Over summer I would typically work for M&S but I have not heard from them. The closing of non-essential shops means I won’t be hired in womenswear and its unlikelyI’llbe recruited in the Food Hall considering the company will have a surplus of workers without work to call-up. The drive from Prestatyn is not something I’m yearning to repeat, but Ido miss my independence. Being constantly stuck at home, after living by myself for three years at university has been difficult. Knowing that I’d have asmallincome over summer would be something to look forward to over the holidays. But spending quality time with my family at home is rewarding. My parents are working from home; my mum more so than my dad. She’s a solicitor and takes calls/answers emails and does dictation in the dining room, while mydad is in the living roompretending to do work. He’s a headteacher and will take the odd phone call or send an email while watching TV. As my mum is in the vulnerable category, mydad’s been picking up and dropping off files at her office on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays when she’s working. She has got frustrated with his slow pace quite often;he’s reluctant to get out of bed and drive to H. It usually ends with my mum chasing him out of the door at 10am when he still hasn’t left. Keeping in contact with my grandparents has been entertaining. My cousin invited my Nana to do a quiz over Zoom and flat-out refused because she couldn’t be bothered. But to be fair, she and my grandad have learnt how to use facetime on her iPad. They regularly facetime my family but it’s very rare we get a glimpse of their faces – it’s usually the ceiling, their hairlines, or their thumbs. My mum was invited by the priest to join our parish on a Zoom mass. So far, I’ve sat throughfour masses on our living roomcouch everySundayat 11am. It’s difficult to stop myself from yawning. There are no hymns. No readers. And no congregation. All listeners are put on mute and all you can see is the priest, alone, in church performing the mass. To compensate for the Eucharist, the priest puts an image and a piece of music on the screen for listeners to reflect upon. It isn’t the same. But my cats are very entertaining; they’re disconcerted byout silence when the walk into the living room and attempt to gain attention bydropping leaves they’ve caught at our feet. It’s very sweet. Mydad arranged aZoomcallwith an old schoolfriend fromAmerica he’d recentlygot in touch with. He was shocked to discover his friend had left his wife and family and remarried to a man. Without the lockdown, Idon’t think he’d had got in touchwith his old friend. He’s been on Facebook regularly trying to reconnect with old acquaintances. As my mum is in the vulnerable category, the weekly shop has fallen upon me to fulfil. My dad hates shopping; asking him to do a big shop twice a week will probably tip him over the edge. Heviews domestic work as ‘woman’s work’and so does absolutely nothing around the house. I go around three times a week and buy only what we need; I make a meal plan and try to arrange a night of eating leftovers twice a week to stop bulk buying. Previously, man family never did this; my mum would nip into Aldi on the way home from work and buy something; onlyoccasionally would we have leftovers. Ionly shop at Lidl;I feel Aldi’s quality of fruit and veg has become poor, and Tesco is too expensive. But I think Lidl is poor at maintaining socialdistancing between customers and staff. Yes, there’s a cleaning station to disinfect trolleys and baskets at the store’s entrance, and the tills are equipped withplastic screens and two-meter standing points, but that’s it. The rest ofthe store is afree-for-all, open to an individual’s interpretation of ‘two-meters’. And not all customers use the cleaning station; even the pump on the hand sanitiser is so stiff, I can only manage to squeeze a drop from it before the stand threatens to topple over! One fifty-something man lent directly over me to grab a bag of carrots and mumbled ‘sorry, love’ when I glared at him. Itryand go early in the mornings (around 9am) to avoid people like these liberally shopping, without adhering to the two-meter rule. It’s been a struggle to entertain myself, especially now that I have finished university, with no exams to revise for. In April I had my last video-call seminar and have found myself bored. I’ve so far done two-and-a-half jigsaw puzzles, before getting bored and giving up; all three were Christmas themed, being the only we had in the house. I’ve practiced a lot onthe piano, but don’t think I’ve improved at all. Itend to play the same songs over and over untilI move on to something else. But I have done a lot of reading and have slowly started to plough through all the books ive piled up from birthdays and Christmas. Since the beginning of lockdown in MarchI’ve read fourteen books. And I’ve begun to read feminist literature;I’ve been wanting to read Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez for awhile. I’ve refused to pay for it in hardback, but there was only one copy in the library in Lancaster, so I bought it for mybirthdayin paperback and read it in two days. I’m now on Difficult Women by Helen Lewis. I’ve also read My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell which was so disturbing, on top of watching the Filthy Rich documentary on Netflix on the Epstein scandal. But it gets so depressing in the evenings if the only stories to listen to are either coronavirus or sexual abuse. Myself, my mum and my sister have started doing quizzes of an evening out of sheer boredom; we’re all terrible!I’m convinced mysister is cheating at the true/false questions. Personal hygiene has gone right out of the window. Yes, I still thoroughly wash my hands and take regular showers, but I’ve given up on routinely washing my hair or ironing my clothes, or actually getting dressed into something other than pyjamas. Given we can only go out to exercise or shop for foodonce aday, what’s the point?I’ve even succumbed to a lockdown haircut for the sheer problemthat I didn’t know what else to do with myhair. It’s now resting just under my collarbone, with a good four inches hacked off. I allowed my mum to do it, and I think she quite enjoyed herself. I only get my haircut once a year since I refuse to regularly pay £30 for a trim. And after the lockdown, Idon’t think I ever will!I actually quite like mynew haircut;I didn’t have to suffer through endless chatter at the salon, or dither over how I wanted it cut, or come out of the salon after two hours despising it anyway! It was great! And my cat was very confused over what was happening. He sat under my chair throughout watching bits ofhair fall to throughground. My mumeven cut mydad’s hair, but I don’t think he’ll let her at it again. It looked dreadful. Verypatchy…I even think he was slightly bald in one spot, just in front of his ears! Thankfully, it’s beginning to grow back. But even mymum is beginning to look like NoelFielden; her fringe is so long she can’t see and has had to make an emergency set of headbands to pull it off her face. I’ve been sleeping very soundlythroughout the lockdown. The onlyproblem is trying to spend the day in order to make myself tired in the evenings to want to go to bed. My sister has done the opposite: she woke at 1pm a few days ago and during the evening decided the only way to get her sleeping schedule back on track was to pull an all-nighter. I remember waking at 6:30am to find her sitting up in bed, completely dressed, watching a film on her laptop. From her clear-eyed look (different to her accustomed zombie gaze) I could tell immediately she hadn’t gone to sleep – at all! My mum was fuming. She went to bed at 9pm that day after being up 32 hours. To be honest, her attempt to renew her sleeping schedule did work – for about a week. She consistently rose around 7am, but recently she’s been getting up at 11:30am. I think the lack of structure in her day from school has relaxed her attempts to take care of herself."

Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health I’ve been anxious because of the pandemic. I feel very Asian in public. Acts of racial violence towards Asian people globally really worry me and make me realize that there are so many shitty, racist people in the world. I started therapy online during the lockdown, which has helped a little, I think. My partner rarely experiences anxiety, even during this pandemic, which makes me feel distant and like I can’t relate. Physically, we’ve been fine and our families have been fine. My mother in law and dad both had colds during lockdown, and now I wonder whether they actually had COVID. But they haven’t been tested. When they got sick, California had really limited testing. In the past few weeks, we’ve been hearing about lockdown modifications. We’ve been seeing countries end lockdowns and ease lockdowns. This, surprisingly, makes me feel anxious. I’m anxious about the return to the high speed and expectations of normality. I’m still working a shitty online job that will take anyone and thus feel basically unemployed, so job searching during normality will mean I’ll be beating myself up a lot for being unemployed again, which is a mindset that’s died down a little during the lockdown. The lockdown felt like an excuse to be unemployed. When everyone returns to work, i’ll feel like I’m back to being the different, non-participatory unemployed person. The Government I think Boris Johnson is a fool for easing lockdown measures already. I think Nicola Sturgeon is making the right choice in not easing measures, is a straight shooter who actually answers questions instead of evading them. I predict that in the upcoming months, we’ll see more unwise decision-making from Boris Johnson. News I try to limit my news consumption to Mondays only. I read the New York Times and the BBC. I noticed the BSL interpreters at Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings and thought it was awesome/she is awesome. Work and home life I’ve been teaching English second language classes for about 10 hours a week online to kids in Beijing. It feels like I’m unemployed though because this company will take anyone and I’m so sick of teaching. I just got my masters in a non-teaching area last year, so am looking for a job in that field unsuccessfully. I feel lucky to have the online teaching thing even though it’s a lame job. I’m glad I’m childfree and don’t have to take care of kids at home during lockdown. Lockdown hasn’t changed my marriage much because we’ve been living a lockdown lifestyle during the winter after moving to Cornwall anyway due to the cold, lack of friends, and my lack of a driver’s license. Technology I haven’t learned to use any new forms of tech during lockdown. I’ve been using FaceTime and Whats App to video chat with friends and family. I use Zoom for our Cornish lessons online and Google Hangouts for online therapy. People have been swarming to TikTok but I dont want to join another social media site that will only take up more of my time. I want to use the internet less, not more. It’s been both nice and overwhelming as an introvert to suddenly get lots of video chat invitations. It’s a great thing that people have more time to reconnect in general right now though. Sometimes there’s not much to talk about because we’re all just staying home. I’ve cut down on my social media usage (I’m just on Instagram) because it’s been feeling like a waste of time and I’d rather spend that time outside or reading. I also dislike people talking about and reminding me about the pandemic on instagram lately. I understand that people want to discuss their feelings about it, which is great, but it isn’t great for my mental health so I limit instagram a lot lately. Shopping and food I miss getting groceries delivered. I’ve been the sole grocery shopper in our house because females have a lower mortality rate than males from COVID. I wear a mask. I wonder whether people feel uncomfortable around me because I’m asian. I hate that I feel this way and it makes me want to move back to California. I am appalled that people don’t obey the 2 meter rule in Tesco. We go to Waitrose sometimes because the crowds are less dense than those at Tesco, but Waitrose is more expensive. I realized that a lot of my grocery shopping anxiety comes from the huge amount of time it takes fo rme to use the self checkout machines and pack up the groceries, so I decided last week that for my mental health, I’ll start using the cashier check out instead. I’ve been trying more new recipes since lockdown because I’m craving novelty and variety. Before lockdown, I was more focused on job searching and more hopeful that I’d get hired. But now that no one is hiring, I’m spending less time on job searching and that gives me more time to cook and have fun cooking. Seeing everyone else baking sourdough makes me not want to bake sourdough though. We found a 16kg bag of flour on amazon last week and we’ve been baking and eating more sweets since. Baking is such a physical experience. It feels like the opposite of the internet. Entertainment and Leisure I’ve been staying entertained during lockdown and don’t relate to people who say they’re so bored. Maybe this is because I’m so introverted. I’ve been watercolor painting, making films, watching films, reading, watching book tubers on YouTube, identifying plants and posting them on iNaturalist, picking flowers and making bouquets, going on walks, doing at home workouts. Once a week I host a family game night on zoom. I love all the free time. It makes me wish we didn’t have to work in life so I would always have time to pursue hobbies like this. I’ve read 86 books in 2020 and love how much time I have to read! Personal hygiene I’ve been so much better about moisturizing, taking care of my skin, and taking my supplements because I have more time during lockdown. There’s just more time for self care. I bought nail polish online today because for the first time in eight years, I’m not rock climbing, so I can paint my nails without them getting chipped. I’ve gone through waves of wearing makeup because it makes me feel awake, and not wearing makeup because it’s annoying to take off and i don’t see anyone in my days anyway. Sleep My sleep has been really good during lockdown. I’ll miss sleeping 9 hours a night!"

Mass-Observer S7195 describes themself as female; age 20; single; student.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","S7195, Female, 20, Single, Bawtry, Student Spring Directive COVID Update 1. Health: I have been lucky enough to not know of anyone (personally) to have contracted/died from COVID. I know friends of friends or family of friends who have less pleasant stories though, so am aware of how lucky this makes me. In terms of my own health, both physically and mentally, I am well. However, I have been lucky enough to find a job at my local supermarket and so am able to keep myself busy. I think I would be struggling mentally, had I not had the focus and routine of employment outside of the house. 2. The Government: I have not been largely impressed with the government’s handling of the crisis. Firstly, I think Boris has been too slow to implement public safety measures – this was the case with implementing the lockdown, facilitating testing, a track and trace system and the compulsory wearing of facemasks. I appreciate the unique nature of the situation, but think that Boris has been incompetent. However, it pains me to say, I have been somewhat impressed by Sunak’s attempts to support the economy; although flawed, his policies have been uncharacteristically generous for a Tory chancellor and hope they will have propped up areas of the economy which would have otherwise disappeared. 3. News: I keep up with the news by watching BBC News at night, but also through twitter – my algorithms largely reflect current affairs and I enjoy following debates on there. My family and I are lucky enough to freely and easily access news sources, but I appreciate this may not be the case for others. I would support any attempt to make the news more accessible. 4. Work and Home Life: Throughout the pandemic and lockdown I have; written my dissertation, turned 21, graduated from university and started a new job. I have been working in the Home Delivery department at a local, and feel very lucky to have the job. It has kept me busy, and in a routine but also allows me to contribute to the community. I think has also had a positive effect on the relationships I have with my family; there is generally less tension, as I am not here as often and so we can enjoy space from each other during this intense time. My mum (a history teacher and head of dept) has been working from home, and I think has found the experience more testing, due to the lack of variety. My dad (a prison governor) has been attending work throughout. I think this has allowed our family to enjoy a smoother quarantine, as we are not constantly together. 5. Technology: I have kept in touch with friends through zoom, facetime and social media. In recent weeks I have been more able to meet up with them, and have enjoyed socially distanced picnics or drinks etc. I think there has been a pressure to keep up with friends; there is a growing cancel culture, that assumes that when people do not check in with you, they aren’t nice people. I am keen to avoid this, but also take a genuine interest in my friend’s wellbeing. 6. Shopping and Food: As previously mentioned, I work in Home Delivery and I suppose I have a unique insight into having groceries delivered. We offer home delivery and click/collect and are very busy at the moment. We have gotten increasingly so as time has gone on too – the company don’t expect to see a decline any time soon either. I know some people can be unhappy with availability, but this is because customers are purchasing so much, shelf stackers/suppliers struggle to keep up. I know tensions are high, but I sometimes wonder if customers know that there lack of a full shop is not for the want of trying! I have also heard many people S7195, Female, 20, Single, Bawtry, Student Spring Directive feedback to us saying that they struggle to get delivery slots, so I wonder if that is a worry for some too. At M we also offer a doorstep delivery for vulnerable people, who phone their order in – this is used a lot by elderly people around the area. a. I have been doing our family’s weekly shop, and have found that stock is mostly there – we can largely get everything we want and the experience is generally pretty normal. However, I do go on quiet, mid-week days at an early time, so may miss the rush. b. In terms of eating habits, I think you would expect us to be eating healthier, homecooked meals. However, in reality, we eat relatively similar to usual – we have always eaten relatively well and so have largely been maintaining this. 7. Entertainment and Leisure: If I am honest, I am not too sure how I have been entertaining myself! I spend a lot of my day at work, then take a nap (as I get up at 3am) and by then it is almost teatime, and then I will get ready for bed. I have been enjoying some TV and have been grateful for the return of football – I enjoy watching that too. Aside from this, I have spent a bit of time learning how to draw/trace pictures to create digital images – I have used them to draw my friends with a cap and gown on for their graduations. 8. Personal Hygiene: I have found myself washing my hands much more than usual, and so I sometimes get dry hands – I have never used so much hand cream in my life! I also wash my hair everyday now, which I didn’t before. However, this is more to do with wanting to present myself well at work, over hygiene. 9. Sleep: I have been sleeping pretty regularly, aside from moving my routine to sleep earlier and get up earlier for work. However, before I had the job, I found I didn’t find it as easy – I wonder if this was because I was not doing much to use my energy and was without a routine."

Mass-Observer P7209 describes themself as female; age 56; married; working as a teacher.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209       Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. ‘Health’ means being well, in body and in mind. ‘Wellbeing’ means much the same as health, but also encompasses theindividual’s relationships and connection with their environment and everyday experiences. For me, ‘wellbeing’ is a more holistic term, underlining that health must include the mental as well as the physical; perhaps also the spiritual. (I think about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs; I also think about Seligman’s Positive Psychology.) The first five words that come to mind when I imagine a healthy body are: fruit, veg, slim, exercise, calm. One of the healthiest-looking people I know is my daughter’s maths teacher. She’s young, vegan, very good at maths, very good at teaching, reads quality literature for pleasure, and she glows with health and beauty. When I sit opposite her at parents’ evening I’m mesmerised. Identity I have no doubt that my experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by my gender, ethnicity, social class and sexual orientation. I’ve benefited from my white privilege, my economic privilege, and the fact that as a straight white woman I haven’t had to endure the prejudice experienced in the past by my gay friends. The correlation between household income and health is frightening. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I remember being told as a child to eat my greens and carrots. I didn’t like them, but I ate them. (Nowadays I love all fruit and vegetables.) Being healthy, in childhood, meant eating food that was good for you, cleaning your teeth and getting fresh air. My parents were responsible for my health and wellbeing. They drove home the veg message, and for this I’m very grateful. My father took us out for walks allthe time, and taught us about nature, and I’m very grateful for this too. Conversations about health took place around the kitchen table, I should think. We didn’t go to the doctors much, and indeed my parents encouraged us to go to school rather than have days off sick. On the few occasions when I had to miss school for illness, my mum used to say: ‘You’d better make sure you do some work’ – which I suppose gave me the message that there are degrees of illness, and (luckily for me) I was never that ill. I can’t remember learning much about health in school. There was a woman who showed up now and again to talk to us about relationships etc, but it was all a bit ad hoc, and I’m afraid we didn’t take her very seriously. She was known as ‘The sex lady’ but I can’t remember any lessons about sex. Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209  Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. My best friend at school (who is still my best friend today) was the daughter of a doctor and a nurse, and thanks to them I converted my family to the joys of wholemeal bread and muesli, both of which we’d barely heard of. A wholefood shop opened in Hereford where you could buy this stuff. We liked the taste of the wholemeal bread, even after mum encountered some resistance when slicing a loaf one day – and found a rusty nail inside. I’ve just remembered that my parents abandoned butter in favour of Flora margarine, and full-fat milk for semi-skimmed. Sad times. I do remember obsessing about food and this is one of my few regrets in life – I was often told off as a little girl at school for leaving my dinner, which made me feel guilty and confused. My mum went to ‘Weight Watchers’, and perhaps this contributed tomy getting the message that women should ‘worry’ abouttheir weight, although I’m sure this wasn’t the only reason. As I got older and podgier I worried about being overweight, and was teased about it. I worried about this, off and on, for years. It’sinteresting that despite being educated in feminist interpretations of the culture which pressurises women to care about their ‘body image’, and despite being reasonably media-savvy, I still internalised those damning messages. At some point during my first pregnancy, I realised I had stopped worrying about my weight. I’ve scarcely given it a thought since. Needless to say my weight has remained stable. I have always hated competitive sports, associating them with mud, frustration, cold and tedium. I can’t blame my school PE teachers as they were actually very nice. I don’t mind swimming but I’m fundamentally lazy and can’t be bothered with getting changed, getting wet, getting dry again … What a faff! But I love walking and particularly love walking in the countryside. As I’ve grown older I’ve realised, more and more, the importance of green spaces, and was lucky to have enjoyed these in childhood – living in semi-rural Hereford; going for lots of walks with Dad and with my friends. As a family we go for walks less often now the children are teenagers and we no longer have a dog. It’s a pity. On holiday we walk a lot, but we no longer seem to have time to go for long walks every weekend, as we used to. I associate wellbeing with fields, streams, woods, forests, hills, the sea …I read a lot about nature and in very stressful times I’verelied on reading nature books last thing at night to help calm me down before going to sleep. I particularly recommend John Lewis-Stempel’s books (a fellow Herefordian). Having any good book to read, especially last thing at night, contributes to my sense of wellbeing. Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209  Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. Quiet, not rushing around too much. Having space. Making things. Music. The arts. Absence of worry about money, work and, especially, family members. I used to worry about friends and friendships a lot. Not so much now. Husband works as a counsellor, so that’s his world, and I’ve learned a lot from him. I think he’s by nature happy-go-lucky, but he’s had his share of difficulties and has learned how to deal with stuff. He has all sorts of strategies and is very good at looking at situations from different perspectives. Through stressful life events, I’ve come to particularly appreciate those times when I’m relatively unstressed and my mental wellbeing is good. I’ve developed my own strategies for coping with the difficult times, and am trying to pass these on to my daughters. I do breathing exercises, practise techniques for getting to sleep if need be, read poetry (concentrated, pure and calming) and, above all, I turn to nature. We have a little cat. She improves all our wellbeing, withouta doubt. It’s not that she’s particularly affectionate, in fact she can be quite scratchy and bitey (she was a rescue cat and is dysfunctional) – but she loves us and we love her. Just stroking her is very calming. And even when, mid-stroke, she turns round and bites us, we just laugh. Laughing is so important! You have to find something to laugh at. I remember in 1999 going through an inspection at the secondary school I was then teaching at. Everyone’s stress levels were through the roof. I had a 40 minute drive to and from work, which at that time I was doing on my own. I can’t remember what prompted me, but I knew it was important to arrive and leave school feeling relaxed. So I bought the radio panel game: ‘I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue’ on cassette tapes, and listened to them on the journey. It did the trick. I currently teach some courses related to mental health and wellbeing. Through my work, I have become increasingly aware of just how many people live on the edge of mental health – how it is, for them, a more or less constant struggle; something which, perhaps, they just have to live with. I admire their courage and resourcefulness, and the way they support each other. I am also increasingly interested in the relationship between mental and physical health. The last time I visited my GP was five years ago, when my lower legs had become swollen, reddened, itchy and painful. These symptoms lasted for about six weeks, and coincided with the finalweeks of my mother’slife, when I was extremely stressed. Neither I nor the GP could find any explanation for what had happened to my legs, other than the stress I was undergoing. Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209  Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. If my family are happy and well, this has a massive positive effect on my own mental wellbeing. Key moments A source of angst and obsession; me and my friends endlessly wondering when we’d start our periods. Triumph when we did; feeling superior to those who had yet to start. Periods were not to be discussed in public back then, which seems utterly ridiculous now. I was more worried about spots, of which I felt I had  a lot, although I probably didn’t, looking back. Growing Older When I was in my mid-twenties I lived and worked for three years in Tanzania. Before I went, I was slightly worried about the health risks – what if I caught malaria, or typhus or … all sorts of other diseases? At the time, the HIV epidemic was at its height, and this was a concern too. We had endless lectures from VSO about safe sex. As it turned out, I think I was probably healthier for those three years than any time before or since. I walked or cycled everywhere. The air was clean. I ate fresh fruit and veg all the time, and very little meat. The pace of life was different. I changed my perspective; realised how lucky I was, compared to most people in the world. I did have malaria, once, and it was horrible – but again, the overriding lesson was how lucky I was to have access to the right medicines and prophylaxis. I now get most of my health and wellbeing info from the Internet. Yes, I’m more aware of my body now, because things go slightly wrong with it more frequently. I need to wear glasses. I feel a bit achy when getting up in the morning. That sort of thing. Nowadays I think a lot about dementia, since my mum died of it, and several of my friends are now going through a similar experience of losing a parent to dementia. I feel it is so important to plan for the possibility of having this illness – and to plan for different scenarios within the illness. I think there would be very little I could do to stop myself from having it, if that’s my lot, but I think there’s a lot I, and we as a family, could do to mitigate the effects. However, good care costs money – and costs will almost certainly increase over time as well. Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209  Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. Over the last year we’ve become more or less completely vegetarian as a family. I feel much healthier – I have more energy. Cooking is more time consuming but on the whole the meals are interesting and enjoyable (I do occasionally hanker after a bacon sandwich).  We went vegetarian primarily through concern about climate change, but also feeling it would be healthier – and my older daughter had gone vegetarian first (physical revulsion from meat, in her case, which is funny because she loved it when she was little) and it makes life easier now we all eat the same thing. I’ve just remembered alcohol! My husband used to specialise in addiction counselling –so again, that means we live in a household where we’re conscious of the damage that alcohol can cause. We don’t drink much (although our daughters dispute this) – on average I suppose about 4-5 units per week. I enjoy alcohol, but not as much as I used to. Years ago I had a work colleague, much loved by everyone, who was a functioning alcoholic. We didn’t realise until it was too late, and she died, far too young. Anyone who has any form of addiction, whether to alcohol, drugs, food or whatever, has my greatest sympathy. Incredibly, it’s probably only within the last twenty years or so thatI’ve come to recognise the importance, and fragility, of mental health – and what this actually means. Health, wellbeing and appearance How are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Interesting question. I try not to make judgements about people’s weight and health but my goodness it’s deeply ingrained. I think skin and hair and teeth are all indicators of health. I think wellbeing can be sensed not so much through appearance as through interactions. Some people come across as calm and good-humoured and interested and kind. I would associate those qualities with inner wellbeing. On the other hand, I would also try never to assume that someone has wellbeing. People are going through all sorts of terrible things that we’re not aware of. Have I ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Yes when younger, now, much less so. I rarely wear make-up. I think it’s an expensive con that persuades women to spend money and time on something that’s fundamentally unnecessary. But if people enjoy wearing it / looking at other people wearing it, that’s fine. Autumn Directive 2020       MO P7209  Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Female, 56, married, living in Cardiff, working as a teacher. Were my parents influenced by such ideals? Yes, to some extent. But mum didn’t spend ages putting on make-up etc. In those days it was more about looking clean and ‘respectable’ which was easy enough. I couldn’t live without toothpaste. Getting ready to leave the house All I remember is people queuing for the bathroom and eating breakfast in shifts. My own routine? Go to the loo, wash, brush my hair."

I don’t look my age and that makes me happy and determined to keep exercising to keep slim and fit. The first five words that come to my  mind when I think of the term, “healthy body” are : slim, wiry, strong, graceful, fit A particular person or image that comes to mind when thinking about health, well-being and a healthy body is an elderly lady I saw on the internet who still dances with poise and supple limbs. She has a straight back, head held high and a look about her as if she is performing and holding the attention of the audience. I like to dance to music on my own as I become too embarrassed in front of family or friends but I wish I did this more often as it makes me feel really good. I tried Silver Swans and loved it but injured the balls of my feet so had to give it up. I do like dancing with my ballet training though and feel quite fit still. I think I heard this word, wellbeing”, when I was teaching full time and being bullied by management. It was clear to me that the buzz word was relevant but actually our well-being was not being well served in that stressful environment. One September coming back to school, I asked about the results of the staff well-being survey which had been taken the previous term and found it ironic when the member of management told me that “we don’t have wellbeing any more”! She meant we were no longer participating in the scheme whereby you report staff responses to a questionnaire and try to adapt school life accordingly. I don’t remember anyone talking directly about health and wellbeing when I was a child, but I was taken to see an optician when it was clear that I had eyesight problems. Otherwise, food and drink were given to me at set times and in set amounts by my parents which I never questioned. I had to eat things I didn’t like because they were good for me – like grapefruit – but wasn’t forced to eat cheese for instance if I really couldn’t bear it. I just took it for hand stands and that you could cycle wherever you wanted to go as we didn’t have a car for everyday use. I didn’t receive any education specifically about health in school but we did have our hands checked for cleanliness before eating School dinners. I did not learn about health and wellbeing from magazines or books but I suppose I did from friends who talked about how often and when they brushed their teeth for instance! I was very active, playing outside every day on roller skates, stilts my Dad made, sledging, cycling and swimming as well as dancing daily once I started Ballet lessons aged 7. I didn’t realize that my periods might have been delayed by ballet dancing but I did become anxious when I did not start menstruating until I was 16years old. I did not want it to be celebrated as I was embarrassed and thought it must never be mentioned in public! Getting ready to leave the house My father used to clean all our shoes when we got ready to go out to school, Brownies and church. He would polish his shoes for work, shave and have a good breakfast while my mother did all the washing up, laundry etc. and stayed at home after we had left. When my mother was going out she would apply her makeup and finish with lipstick which I have never worn and her efforts to look smart were different from mine but I still like to make an effort and imagine who I will meet and how I will present myself. I do enjoy choosing what I will wear and like to suit my clothes to the occasion. I love shopping in Charity shops and finding something really unusual that fits my idea of myself at the time. Of course we are all influenced by popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance but I have never worn make up, apart from on stage and like to think that I am not overly affected by other people’s ideas. I like to be as slim as possible, though, and I like it when people remark on my choice of clothes. I do like the feel of certain fabrics and have just ordered a cycling jacket too – that is often a sign of me taking up a new hobby! Getting My parents always emphasised personal happiness over appearance and never praised us for our looks so my Christian commitment to modesty helped to curb my desire to show off! Although my mother forced me to wear make up for my wedding and she taught my sister how to wear make-up, I resisted these efforts to make me more feminine and I still think that was good for me. My complete reliance on hrt is frightening because I really cannot function without it. My feelings of anger, anxiety and my experience of nightmares and sweating without it are horrendous so I feel like an addict. My Desert Island item would be access to Radio 4 or classical music, preferably Ballet music which reminds me of my father and makes me move. I couldn’t manage without lots of books and a load of futurelearn courses because I love learning and it does me good to keep learning new things and skills such as Mandarin and History. Growing older Now I am more aware than ever of the need to stay active physically so I cycle or walk nearly every day and have recently managed to continue cycling through the winter, even going from home to work 12 miles there and 12 miles back on my e bike which I love. I have learnt line dancing and been a member of a gym group for Nifty Fifties and really enjoyed learning how to use the equipment. I went to swimming lessons for 4 weeks to learn how to breathe properly so that I could swim as another form of exercise but have given that a break since Covid. I expect to continue caring about my health and well being and caring more for my emotional health than I did in the past too. I have been overly reliant on my husband’s happiness in the past and am aware that I need to be more emotionally resilient and support myself when others can’t do that. I choose my own presents and treats, trying  not to be too concerned about whether or not my husband would approve!! Growing up all over again, I suppose. I think this comes with a change of focus after 33 years of bringing up children and putting their needs first. I am slowly realizing my own needs can come first without feeling guilty about that. I have suffered from back pain, difficult pregnancies and then awful peri-menopause and menopause including sweats, headaches, itching (for two years which was awful) and now arthritis in my feet but I feel strong generally and more determined to put my health needs first. Identity It’s hard to say how my own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by my gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation but I suppose the fact that I was brought up to think that I could do anything a boy could do did influence my choices. We used to go walking and mountain climbing in the holidays (I climbed Snowdon aged 7) and chose to learn rock climbing as a teenager. I never thought my gender was a limiting factor and my sexuality might have led me to enjoy choosing clothes to fit a sport but I have seen the same attraction to sporting outfits in men too! I am not physically brave and yet I used to gravitate towards people who were because I wanted to be like them. My best friends’ dad taught me to dive and another friend introduced me to Youth Hostelling and long walks. I am naturally a reader and thinker so not really attracted to the outdoors as much as the rest of my family but I love when I do join them. I like to have a book with me in beautiful places and would get bored if I didn’t have that. So this is about my personality rather than my gender. Sometimes fear of falling and injuring my back or dislocating my knees (which I have done several times) has held me back but generally I like being physically active especially if there is music! I have tried Tai Chi, Aqua aerobics and Body Balance exercise classes apart from leading Israeli Dance workshops and often including dance in my teaching."

Spring Directive 2020 – Part 2 Covid19 (Update) Health: On Saturday 14th march my 11-year-old developed a cough, but no temperature. I phoned my boss to see if I could still go to work on the Monday and she said yes. So, me and my husband went to work, and my 8-year-old went to school. On the evening of Monday 16th March, the government announced that any household where 1 person had symptoms had to self-isolate for 14 days!!! Within a few days of this my 8-year-old also developed a cough. Luckily, we had previously visited the doctors for him as he has suspected viral asthma. My husband and I did not get ill. 14 days at home, not even going out for walks was tough! The first day we could go out was such a relief, but also a little scary as the whole country was in lock down by then. My husband returned to work and I worked from home and looked after the children. It was good for me and my husband to have that space! I have found not having time to myself very difficult. My youngest has had a few bouts of coughs since then where he has needed his inhaler and all of us have had cold symptoms on and off, despite social distancing. My youngest has struggled the most with not going to school and seeing people. He is very sociable and needs those interactions with others. He has been sad and angry a lot. Having his birthday has actually helped as it was day all about him and we saw family from the doorstep. Government: I very much feel that it was too little too late. As much as I am finding lock down difficult, I think that we should have done it sooner, and if we had we might have been able to do it for less time! I think that they tried to put the economy before people’s health and that even in that they may have failed. The suggestion of herd immunity was horrific. They talk about protecting the NHs not stopping the virus, which is worrying. I am concerned that they will re-open schools (which are not actually closed to key workers children) too soon as they give in to economic pressure. Although children may not get ill with the virus, they can give it to the staff and take it home to their families. Plus, many school staff are self-isolating for 12 weeks under government advice to ‘vulnerable’ people, my science department has less than half its teachers available at the moment. It feels like we are bumbling through this! News: My husband watches the 5pm briefing every day and he also tracked the death rate for a long time, until I told him that I wasn’t interested. I found it morbid and unhelpful. I do listen to the briefings and have found some government ministers re assuring and interesting and others seem to be clueless and bumbling. I do agree that we should have BSL interpreters and are surprised that we don’t, no one should be excluded from something so important. I find Facebook problematic as people share a lot of unfounded information and some downright scaremongering rubbish. Even mainstream news outlets like newspapers have shared information as though it is fact when it is actually speculation. My brother messaged me to say have I seen Boris announcement garden centres will re-open, picnics will be allowed, and schools go back end of May. Boris had made no such announcement it was a newspaper article speculating on what he might say! Work and home life: As a teacher I am supposed to be working from home. I have twice daily online meetings at 9am and 3pm. I have to set work and answer pupils emails as well as help with planning for next year and undertaking training. At first, I found it really difficult to manage work and getting my own children to do their schoolwork and to try something creative each day. I have had to relax my expectations and not feel guilty about not doing my schoolwork during the school day and sometimes doing it of an evening. My children are capable of a lot more schoolwork than they are doing but they miss being in the classroom with their friends, so I don’t push them too hard. Technology: I have learnt to use Microsoft Teams for my meetings with colleagues. It has been nice to see peoples faces and to have a set routine. Zoom has been sued for my dance classes and has had its ups and downs, it can be a pain when the sound and picture are slightly out of sync .I don’t like Houseparty is not easy to use and doesn’t seem very secure. Facebook has become a lifeline. I find some of my Facebook friends have become more important, and more inspiring, than, my ‘real life’ friends. It can be a double-edged sword though with so much mis information shared! The one thing that I have refused to do is to learn to use Microsoft Forms for work. I figured that there are other ways of getting feedback on students such as GCSE pod and didn’t see the point in the time investment. Shopping and Food I have found this irritating as I have always shopped online and now, I cannot book a delivery slot as everyone is doing it. I also hate time wasting so really don’t like queuing to get into a supermarket. I have managed to book a regular fruit and veg box delivery and have had 2 meat boxes delivered. My husband picks up anything else that we need from our local co-op on his way home from work. We did find pasta and flour very difficult to get hold of in the beginning. Things seem to be settling down now, however when I did and Asda click and collect order recently had 9 missing items, on of which was my son’s birthday cake and 10 substitutes! Entertainment and Leisure: I seem to have less spare time than a lot of people as I am still working from home and I am starting to hate the pressure I feel through social media to achieve something during lockdown. We have managed to decorate (mostly hubby) and tidy-up//re-arrange downstairs, this was mostly to help with my mental state as I am spending so much time inside and I like neatness and order. I danced before this and still manage to do 3 zoom classes with my regular dance teacher every week. It is different doing solo jazz rather than Lindy hop, bit there is no alternative. I miss walking as we did this a lot, so I also try and fit in a Karen Hauer workout from YouTube or Facebook mist days. My husband and I have watched the Witcher and are currently watching series 2 of Jack Ryan. We needed new TV to watch together. I read and do puzzles as much as I did before all of this and I have managed to do some paintings, which I had been struggling to find time for. Personal Hygiene: I am gutted that my grey roots are really coming through, I usually have pink hair! However, I am not willing to dye it myself as I don’t want to ruin it. My hubby made me use the clippers on his hair, it wasn’t great. Both my boys need haircuts, but I am not willing to make a mess of it. We all shower and get dressed as much as usual; my only concession is that I may go a day longer between washing my hi rans shaving my legs. Sleep: I am having a lot of trouble sleeping. My body and my brain are both not tired enough. One of the reasons I have started exercising more is to make myself physically tired, but even then, I am not always mentally tired enough to sleep. I am going to bed late a lot in the hopes that I will fall asleep easier."

Not having to get up early to drop the kids at breakfast club and get myself to work has meant that I have had no incentive to go to bed early.  For the first week I spelt in late every morning. After national lockdown came in it was a bit of a shock to have to get up in time for an 8:30 teams meeting every day.  I still didn’t manage to make myself go to bed early, I have spent nearly 6 months now going to be late and getting up late.  When I return to work in September I am going to have to alter my going to be and getting up routine by about 3 hours! I found that surprisingly, the days flew by; I had work meetings at 8:30am (eventually changed to 9am) and 3 pm.  This gave me quite a short working day, especially with a significant lunch break, as I had 3 people to feed.  I found it hard to fit in my work, helping the kids with their work and some exercise for us all.  This was made more difficult by the fact that my husband goes to bed early (8pm,) as he goes to work early and I had Zoom dance classes 3 evenings a week at 6pm.  Dance classes had a big impact as it meant everyone else had to be quiet so that I could hear the lesson, so effectively the living room was off limits for an hour.   I found myself quite envious of people who were sharing all the enrichment opportunities that they were taking up with their children on Facebook,  as this as not an option for me with increased work responsibilities.  I had to set lessons, respond to students’ emails, undertake CPD, re write the curriculum for next year and provide online support sessions, not to mention the centre assessed grades for this years GCSE cohort.  I felt like my own children were missing out.  I also struggled with a lack of exercise as I was used to attending several dance classes and 1 aerobics class a week, plus being on my feet all day at work.  Not getting enough exercise affected my mood and my sleeping patterns.  I had to try and prioritise it some days, and use the active well being societies free online sessions. Due to travel restrictions we spent a lot of time walking in the local area.  We discovered ‘new’ parks that we hadn’t been to before and enjoyed watching the seasons change.  Bird song seemed louder wherever we went and we even had a heron in our local park for the first time ever. I am not sure what changes September will bring.  I know that my working day will be very different, with 3, 100 minute lessons a day and less breaks rather 5, 60 minute lessons, plus a break and a lunchbreak.  Also, I don’t know if my dance lessons will be able to return as normal, so may have to try and fit online classes into my working week.  Homelife: My job helped to set a timetable for us as I had meetings at the start and end of the day.  This was also aided by my eldest child returning to school in June.  We went through several versions of a timetable over the months.  So we started with mornings for work and afternoons for creativity.  My kids got tired of this though and I missed exercise so we tried to include that in it too.  The lack of exercise and stimulation caused sleeping problems for both me and my boys (but not my husband).  Eventually as my youngest got more and more fatigued, it became a case of getting things done at whatever time suited us that day, and sometimes doing double school work one day so that he could have another day off. I think that we all missed having a proper routine, and that my job massively impacted out home life, particularly my teams meetings.  I had to return to work 1 day a week, which meant that my youngest got to go to school for that day and he loved it.  The one positive from my job is that it kept us aware of the days if the week and of time moving forward.     As I have already mentioned, trying to keep up with my dance classes and doing them live on zoom impacted family life.  It meant that dinner had to be eaten by a certain time and that everyone had to either be quiet or find another room to be in whilst my class was going on.  It also lead to us feeling like Thursday was the start of the weekend as my classes were over my then so we had more freedom.  Media and technology: Microsoft teams ahs been essential to my job; it is how I have stayed connected to my department everyday and it has allowed us to offer academic support sessions to students.  Teams will continue to be used for daily briefings in September as we still have to socially distance.  We have even used it for a Friday night drinks catch up.  Its also been used by my husband’s workplace for Monday night quizzes (although these had to run on trust as we were making our own). I have used WhatsApp more too, we have a work group and a wellbeing group.  It has also allowed us to video call family.  My mother in law uses the phone a lot more now, she used to only say a few words before hanging up, now we have whole conversations! One way I have used technology less is for shopping; I used to regularly do my grocery shopping inline, but found myself unable to book a slot due to an increase in demand because of covid-19.  This meant a change in my shopping habits; I have planned meals less and sent my husband to the shops more often as he was going out to work everyday anyway.  Eventually I managed to get a regular fruit and veg box deliver, thanks to Facebook. Waiting: I had to wait from March until July 6th for a hair appointment, I used to go every 5 weeks.   I found this quite difficult as ,y hair has been pink and I have grey roots coming through.  As a result of lockdown I have decided to grow out the pink and have a metallic grey dye put through my hair as this is closer to my natural colour (and I wont get a chance to grow my roots out without seeing people again). My dental surgery has seen my children but still aren’t seeing adults for routine appointments so I am still waiting for that.  My son was given an inhaler for possible asthma before lockdown and he has not had a follow up appointment since then to review his asthma care.  Conversely when I had to go to A&E for a burn and when I had to take my son because he banged his head after fainting, the wait was far less than usual. On area that I have been reluctant to wait is in supermarket queues.  I have avoided going to shops as I hate wasting time queueing!"

No pain, but each of us has lost a bit of filling and would like to have the problem seen to in case it develops into infection or a bigger problem. Additionally, I had a neck/shoulder pain over New Year that persisted, alleviated for a while by a physiotherapy session and an exercise regime, but a vague ache in my upper left arm slowly got worse, and then a sensation like a mild electric shock and numbness started. I didn’tdo anything about it, as we had a couple of trips planned, and it was intermittent. Then lockdown started. I took the odd paracetamol when it became too persistent, kept doing the exercises, but it got worse, so I eventually rang the GP: she diagnosed torticollis (wryneck), for which she would normally suggest physiotherapy, but as this wasn’t currently an option, I should go online for appropriate exercises and when Physiotherapy is once more available, she would refer me for it if I still had the problem. Emotionally, we are fine. We regret not being able to meet friends and family, but this is lessened by contact via FaceTime/Skype/WhatsApp videoing. We regret having had to forego 2 long distance walks April/June, and further summer and autumn away plans, but in the greater scheme of things, those are unimportant. We are pursuing enjoyable activities: gardening, painting (woodwork, not art!), virtual meetings with friends/family, online courses, writing for theMOA project, spring cleaning/pruning surplus “stuff”, reading, French for 2 groups currently suspended, short walks, meals/breaks in the garden (the good weather helps enormously), sharing humorous photos/videos/music/jokes with family and friends, some TV (not too much news, mainly feel good programmes, or the odd French film or thriller series). If this continues into the winter, being indoors more could be frustrating, but we have our interests, and hopefully would get out walking sometimes. Government Decisions: I loathe this government. I feel intense anger for their: . failure to get a grip on this pandemic when, with the benefit of seeing what was happening in other countries first, they had time and knowledge to prepare but didn’t; . utter ineptitude over protective clothing provision for health and care workers; . responsibility for, I believe, many thousands of preventable deaths (current excess number of deaths is 60,000); . evident belief that rules they impose apply to us, the hoi poloi, but they, the Entitled Establishment, can flout them (see Dominic Cummings) at will; . corruption in diverting vital funds from deprived areas to Tory councils for CV19 services. Sadly, we can’t shed them any time soon, but I hope/fantasise that they, or at least their greed-based philosophy, short-termism and determination to sell off every public good, will be extinguished as a political force, and that we will take from this mess a more civilised, caring, responsible society, which recognises that we are mutually dependent, in which we are all prepared to contribute enough to ensure important work, no matter how humble, deserves a living wage enough for families to live securely and safely on without the need for food banks, and in which we act meaningfully on the climate change crisis. Future Government Steps: . Assuming no miracle vaccine or sudden disappearance of CV19, what I think they will do will be habituate us all to a higher incidence of CV19 deaths as a fact of life. I might have become paranoid, but the story that circulated, which inspired Dillie Keane’s“Song for Dominic Cummings”1 has a strong ring of truth to it to me. Just as UK citizens got used to war in 1940-45, we could become used to a pandemic, much higher death rate. The old will have to stay in for at least another year –or accept a much higher risk of CV death than younger people, who might in the end survive as herd immunity develops. . The government won’t keep paying people not to work.They didn’t learn from other countries at the outset, but they will certainly be motivated to get the drones back to work ASAP, and not lag behind other countries. So they will “encourage”people intoany work by stopping CV lockdown funding the moment they can get away with it. . There will be a huge increase in unemployment. The government will divert the unemployed onto the inadequate Universal Benefit, and there will be more gig economy/zero hours work pushed in people’s wayas the only work available. News: . We wake to the 7AM BBC Radio 4 Today programme news headlines.  When we can’t stand it any longer (around 13 mins), J bangs the off button and we start the day. . I glance through online newspapers on my phone: The Guardian, The Independent, The Conversation, BBC, & Apple News which gives other newspaper headlines etc. . We avoid the news most days otherwise. I will sometimes listen to the 6PM radio 4 news if cooking dinner, but not often for the entire 30 minutes. . I almost never listen to the 5PM daily Govt broadcast, and the most recent one I heard, fronted by Priti Patel just angered me more, confirming that I have more useful things to do with my time. They’ve adopted the ruse of taking questions from the general public before press(pretending “theimportance” of their public, but it’saway of reducing press questions), which they fail to answer then ensure no follow-up questions, ditto the press. Makes me so angry, their appearance of calm control belying the ineptitude beneath. And their weasel words whenever criticized that they are See end following the science, ie getting ready to blame the scientists. Which reminds me, I should have added “cowardice” totheir above shortcomings. . I wholeheartedly agree thatBSL should beused as it is in Scotland. I’ve notice Nicola Sturgeon using it and it is positive. Work and Home Life: We are both retired, as are most of our (Boomer) friends, so all we learn about being furloughed, homeschooling etc has come from what our nieces have told us. Job futures are a worry for them (and for us, of course, we worry how they will manage in the future, for example, 1 niece and her partner bought a more expensive house last year, to be nearer Gatwick, where her partner C is an EasyJet pilot……but that could well be at risk now, and then how will they manage their mortgage? My niece has a 3 year old daughter, so can’tgo to work and earn enough,should her partner lose his job, since her former career was in the finance sector, and they will be in the quagmire now). We are at home much more than we have been in many years. J has itchy feet, and we have an aged caravan, so for as long as I can remember, we have been off like a shot for holidays, abroad or at home, sightseeing and hiking, visiting friends in Germany, USA, France as well as having them come stay with us; also quite an active social life locally –so, we have been at home now, entirely alone, since 22nd March, most of the time in the house. It SHOULD bea strain, but it isn’t.We are both fortunate to have a house that is large enough for us to do our own thing in, as well as together; a garden where we can get exercise gardening, fresh air and privacy. We have more activities and interests to pursue than we easily have time for, so enforced quarantine is proving useful in catching up a bit with these! We have developed virtual contactwith friends and family. We can’t go shopping, but earlier anxiety has dissipated,since Morrison’s, our local supermarket chain, expanded its delivery service. And we have refined our established meal planning to a week or more ahead, instead of days. In fact, we think it possible that we will continue to have deliveries, in the wished-for event that this pandemic ever goes away and isn’t replaced by something worse. Friends who go to collect pre-ordered farm shop goods always offer to get things we might need, and between us, neighbours look out for each other. Technology: We never used FaceTime before, but do now on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings with 2 other couples, enjoying wine, and playing Perudo or Trivial Pursuits with one of them. Family and several friends: we’ve discovered WhatsApp video contact, and thatcomesin useful with one of my sisters and her 3 daughters. We speak to my sister every Sunday morning over coffe/tea, but catch up with the nieces haphazardly, depending on their infants’ cooperation!  The infants sometimes assuming IT’S ALL ABOUT THEM! And of course it is, really. They are all much-loved infants, the brightest, most talented ones in the whole world, of course. Two nieces (1 in England, 1 in Spain): Friday night get together: was via WhatsApp, but moved to Skype –improved sight and sound. Friends on Monday afternoon: was WhatsApp, nowtryingSkype, but it’s the blind leading the blind, without my technology-generation nieces to sort us out. I have a FaceBook account, but not sure why. All I ever do with it is post worthy causes and petitions on it so I guess my limited range of recipients take cover when they see another post from me! Definitely not interested in Twitter (too Trumpish) or Instagram. J complains enough about how I’ve become an annoying mobile phone user, checking alland anything every minute, so I don’t want to annoy him further; nor in fact doI really want to become a device-addict. So, no more new gadgets or Apps! Shopping & food: It took us a while, but after the first 3 weeks following lockdown, when we were dependent on friends for shopping from their deliveries/click&collect, we managed to get onto Morrison’s delivery list and it’sbecome much easier/quicker. Mind you, we have an impressively stocked pantry, but all tins, packets, dried goods etc., so still needed the perishables. We did order goods from Holland & Barrett, some specialist things from eBay eg bulk dried mushrooms & tomaotes, and some food flavourings. We’ve been shopping once, some 2 weeks ago: to Holland & Barrett for wheat gluten to use with non-bread flour, only we can’tgetwholewheat flour of any sort atall. Delivery shopping has encouraged us to do even more meal planning, not just for the next few days, but for a week+, including cataloguingallthe contents of our 2.5 freezers……Jworked for hisfirst year after graduating as a work study officer, and he still bears all the hallmarks of being a natural. Hence the catalogue. Once I’d stopped falling about laughing at the idea, I caved in. It’sagood idea! But I’m not letting him anywhere near my books. And we are trying to reduce the pantry hoards.  Since our savings are rapidly diminishing, its no bad thing to adopt some saving ways. We overbought the first time or two, though wasted nothing (we were raised by WW2 Make Do & Mend parents. It sticks) –those 2.5 freezers earned their keep. As for eating: yes, we are eating differently. We’ve been having too many biscuits with mid-morning and mid-afternoon drink breaks: gingernuts and chocolate hobnobs being the addiction. So, finding we have little self-control, we’ve agreed to have none in the morning, and only 2 each in the afternoon. Which isn’t great, butisa whole lot better than the near-gorgingwe’d abandoned ourselves to hitherto, since lockdown. Having adopted the 5 : 2 diet some 3 years ago, and each having lost best part ofacouple of stone, we’ve been reasonably sensible (except maybe holidays/parties)…. until early April, by when wewere colluding in increased self-indulgence: not enough distractions, maybe? We’ve certainly been busy, and are now even busier having embarked ona wholesale painting job, but it’s awfully easy to develop the habit of taking a break morning and afternoon, wander into the warm sunny garden with a cuppa andaplate of biscuits or cake….. Otherwise, we are eating healthily: the usual cereal & toast breakfast, lunch (maybe more vegetable soups than usual, mainly to consume the rather excessive amount of root veg we seem to keep buying), an evening meal: often a varied salad and fish or omelette or stuffed mushrooms; sometimes meat, often not, and fruit (mostly oranges) or home made rhubarb or apple or gooseberry crumble with plain yoghurt. But it’s mostly what weate B.CV. Entertainment & Leisure: . J plays chess fairly steadily on his iPad, but he did that B.CV. . We e-socialise as described earlier. DEFINITELY A NEW SKILL. . Gardening (more than we ever did before, but that’sbecause B.CV, we did the absolute minimum! . 3-4 mile walks through deserted building site/commercial & industrial estates c. x3p.w. Did knee and neck exercises for a while to ease arthritis and torticollis problems, but they’ve dwindled ‘cos they’re boring.We used to do a lot of walking and are missing it, but feel reluctant to go beyond the set lockdown limits or go in the parks too often, because runners, cyclists, young people, family groups aren’t thatcareful about social distancing. . Music whilst we work: J Spotify (blues & folk tendency); me Classic FM. . I did an online Genealogy course via FutureLearn, and have now started an Irish Language & Culture, with more courses to follow if I can cram them into our busy days! Which start at 7AM and finish not usually before 9PM, before an hour of TV usually then bed . And of course the Forth Bridge project: the much-needed repaint of all our woodwork and doors, preceded by spring cleaning preparation. . TV viewing: mostly feel good programmes eg The Repair Shop, Jamie Oliver’s Keep Cooking & Carry On, Would I Lie To You?, French films we’ve recorded or found in charity shops in the past & French thrillers eg via Walter Presents on Channel 4, some documentaries eg BBC4’s AndrewMarr’s History of Modern Britain/ Music for Tyrants/The Georgians. We studiously avoid too much news, other than 10-15 minutes radio headlines at 7AM, partly because so much is exclusively CV related navel gazing, speculative, political spin; notbalanced with serious news about what’s happening elsewhere, where people are far worse off than we are. I find our selfish, ignorant self-preoccupation hard unendurable. . Reading: J historical adventures or fact checking/statistically based books (not heavy academic ones, more those that become briefly best sellers eg Factfulness. Currently alongwith his novel, he’s reading The Art of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter…. Well, he taught Economics, so it’s probably lightbedtime reading!); his current novel is a Simon Scarrow one about Napoleon and Wellington. My reading includes Jacqueline Winspear’s Maisie Dobbs and Lindsey Davis’ Flavia Albiaand Jane Thynne’s Clara Vine stories, The Week magazine when it’sa week or two old after J finishes with it (I don’t wantitwhen it’s fresh), and I’ve just started reading a book a friend sent me she has just had published called The Mistress, the Matriarch and the Virgin Queen, about 3 key women in the Tudor dynasty saga. Personal Hygiene: Much the same as it was B.CV. Gardening and DiY in this weather encourage showers. But I’ve become much more slopping about clothes-wise at home: baggy, elastic-waisted jogging pants and T-shirts. The rare occasion we go out, I change into something a little tidier eg trousers and blouse or the very occasional skirt (I rarely wear these any more, other than for hot weather). I’ve realised also thatwhilstI wash underwear and bath towels after one use, outer clothing I’ve been wearing maybeup toaweek before laundering, unless worn away from home, in which case they are put immediately in the washing machine, as soon as we return home. I feel comfortable clumping about the house in my slops, but if and when it’s safe to go out openly again, I shall have to remind myself that one has to make more of an effort if visiting or being visited by friends. J’s style has always been casual. Nothing new there then. I’m also much fussier about cleaning loos, sinks and kitchen surfaces frequently than previously: not just because our cleaner is currently not coming to us, but because of CV for some reason. My hair needed urgent cutting because my last hair appointment was 23rd March, which I cancelled. I wear my hair short, and it was really irritating me, so I surrendered and allowed J to cut it for me. A truly terrifying experience, watching him flail at my hair with scissors, but despite some slightly eccentric bits that needed later attention when he wasn’tlooking, to my surprise, he didn’t doa bad job. So, I might just have to risk letting him doit again. I’ve done hisfor years, so nothing new there. Sleep: No insomnia or nightmares. I go out almost like a light, not quite as immediately as J, and wake around dawn, mainly because of the heat outside, I think, but drowse comfortably till 7AM and the radio alarm. I don’t thinkmy sleeping pattern is any different from B.CV. But maybe that’ because we spenda lot of time outdoors and gardening & DiY are quite tiring. I tend not to remember dreams, nothing new there. Once I would have lain awake chewing over the ills of society, the world, the politicians, whatever dominated, but since a fairly protracted time of family illness and bereavement between 20and 10 years ago, whenI couldn’t control my compulsion to find solutions, and sleep was wrecked for a long time.I wasn’tgood at acceptingthatI couldn’t fix everything. But eventually, somehow I did adapt to that understanding, and I think that is standing me in good stead now. I feel such a fury at so much in the news, but I limit the news I hear/see/read, and keep busy. So I sleep well. As does J who has always had that annoying “If there’sno solution, there’snoproblem” attitude. Butitworks for him! Dillie Keane’s “Song for Dominic Cummings” on the occasion of her 68th birthday:"

It means living a decent life-span. Well-being means not depressed, not easily discombobulated Healthy body: slim, strong, balanced, reliable, resourceful As in: Helen Mirren Identity I came from a very, very poor background. After the war, we experienced real hard­ship. Sugar sandwiches for dinner on friday nights. Also there were a lot of unre­solved tensions in my family and as a child I dealt with them by refusing to eat. My earliest memory is of my mother weeping and pleading “eat it for Mummy”and shaking my head. I didn’t recover from my anorexia till puberty and then, from being skele­tally thin, I became first plump and then fat. I have struggled with my weight all my life. It has been pretty catastrophic for my relationships with men. I’ve been every size from an 8 to a 24. I have always been preoccupied by health issues and have followed every alternative health fad. It’s an insecurity thing. Growing up and learning I didn’t become aware of healthasan issue well until after puberty. My parents knew nothing about it. They never discussed it. They both drank a lot and smoked like chim-neys. I went to a convent school where the only health issue was whether the Nit Nurse found anything on you or not. Key moments My breasts grew and my stomach hurt . I was expecting my first period, and my mother had prepared me well for it. She bought  me abra and a lipstick when I first started, and her friends congratulated me on“beingabig girl now”. I realised after a bit that it all meant that I was fertile. When I was 17 (I looked older) I had my first boyfriend, and I took the day off school and went to Marie Stopes in London and got a cap. I was terrified! H7412 Growing Older Well after about 30 I started to diet and have done so spasmodically for the rest of my life. I’ve never been obese, just carried rather too much flesh always. After about 35 I started to take excersice seriously. Lots of walks, cycling, yoga, gym, gardening , tai chi. I actually only really like the gardening though. What really messed things up was breaking my leg badly, when took ages to heal and which didn’t help my walking. I get health information from the internet, books and TV I am more aware of my body now because I think about mortality I’m 76 and doing everything I can to stay well soI don’t think it’ll  change. I drink a bit too much. I ought to get a handle on that, I hope I can. Health, well being and appearance Appearancematters toa certain extent. I go the the beautician quite a lot. I wouldn’thave plastic surgery though. I have been unhappy because I amnot asslimasthe ideal! My parents were both obsessed by conventional beauty standards.  When I was sex­ually harassed as a young girl, they saw it as a compliment. MY father’s friends used to grope me and when I told my mother, she said “It’s  because you are so pretty”. I wanted to rip my face off. She should have protected me and she didn’t. And neither did he. He groped me aswell occasionally (passing it off asa joke) and it mademe un­comfortable As to beauty aids, I use natural progesterone creamand a vaginal oestrogen against dryness. I wouldn’t want to be without my face cream, Creme de la Mer. I have been going to the same hairdresser in London for years. I wouldn’t dye my hair though. It’s unhealthy (carcinogenic) and it’s a hassle. Anyhow I like it the colour that it is. When my father went out in the evening, he always demanded a clean ironed shirt. My mother worked full time but she still hd to provide this. I hated him for it. His grooming ritual wasaform of tyranny. Before going out, (apart from when I’m just walking the dog), I’ll comb my hair and put some perfume on and some blusher and lipstick."

Mass-Observer B7418 describes themself as male; age 64; married; retired lecturer.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","M-O Number B7418 Male, 64, married, Wallasey, retired lecturer Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2: Everyday health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body I find 'health' and 'wellbeing' hard words to define, despite their frequent use. Health I see as “an absence of illness” (my five words), and secondarily as the capacity to resist ailments and ensure reasonable functioning. A healthy body is, in my imagination, one that does not suffer from disease or excessive infirmity. I may be unusual in not placing any aesthetic views of a 'healthy body' or pejorative views of an 'unhealthy body'. I feel that there is a great deal of judgement around this use of the word, invoking prejudice rather than sympathy or empathy. On the other hand, 'health' in the National Health Service is about the curing or amelioration of disorders, and gets public support because it is free and does not (usually) make judgements about patients. 'Health' is also sold by various organisations as a commodity, with associations of superiority that I find offensive; this is less about health than about cosmetic 'health' and 'beauty'. 'Mental health' is rarely sold as a commodity, and poor mental health carries considerable stigma. The term 'well-being' also bears an ambiguous air to me. I studied the concept of 'well-being' decades ago, but this was then used as a means of assessing the extent to which particular social orders provided and enabled satisfactory lives for their members. For some time, I have been involved with the Canal & River Trust; this regards 'well-being' provided by being 'by water' as central. I feel that this is somewhere between propaganda and a means of seeking public support for those benefits brought by the presence of canals and navigable rivers that cannot generate direct revenue. (I support the general idea of this, but am critical of the term). The third meaning focuses on individuals and their physical bodies, and their mental capacities to deal with the world's challenges. This is close to a wider definition of individual 'health', and I am torn between finding this a helpful term and seeing it as ideological. Identity I am not sure how and whether my perspectives as a white middle class heterosexual male differ from those of different backgrounds. I suppose for some, health (perceived, positive or problematic) is seen to be reflected in personal appearance. I do gain clues about people from their appearance, but try neither to judge people's appearance or apparent health, and am not concerned to provide signals to others. I am aware, from the media (mainstream and social) and everyday talk, of the deep prejudices that seem to attach to appearance and perceived health, with a great deal of negative judgement. I am appalled, frankly, by the prevalence of 'diets', the associations of 'fitness' with superiority, the 'beauty' industry, and much of the mumbo-jumbo of new-age approaches to health (often lucrative ones). It is not that I am not sympathetic when people have general health problems, and feel that they should have significant and non-judgemental support, but the promotion of 'fat-shaming' and the like, with the psychological consequences of feeling personally and socially inadequate, is greatly offensive. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I suppose my first experiences of the idea of health would be when I suffered a number of childhood diseases like chicken pox and measles. I also suffered from childhood asthma and digestive problems, but did not feel that this was about 'health', perhaps because these did not involve visit to the family GP, but various concoctions. My mother and the family GP were responsible for health when I was growing up. I don't recall too many conversations with either parent, although there was concern about the dangers from falling over and other accidents. My mother was in poor health in my childhood, with the invocation of vague threats hanging over her, but the details and consequences were never explained. B7418 I don't recall much health education from primary or secondary schools. I recall getting a polio vaccination and a bcg at secondary school, but with no real discussion. I did not study biology, while the physical education teachers were brutal violent men who enjoyed mocking boys whose bodies and activities did not conform to their ideals. There was no discussion of health and minimal warnings about the avoidance of accidents. I don't recall many conversations about my own health in childhood, but I was influenced by my grandfather's leukaemia (he survived 15 years) and spondylitis, which made him infirm. But I did not find out what this meant -this was felt to lie with doctors. Key moments I recall no discussions about puberty, although I was aware that my older sisters' forms were changing in early adolescence. I mainly recall that facial hair was starting to appear, and a degrading 'joke' by a teacher ridiculing the signs of puberty that this provided. I was aware of my voice breaking but, frankly, didn't incorporate this into any sense of personal progress. I should stress that in early adolescence I was resigned to the idea of simply enduring, avoiding trouble and surviving until I could escape from school. Growing older I come from long-lived ancestors (one lived to 101), and from an early stage expected both myself and my family to live well into our 80s. Whether this is realistic -my father died at 64 -is another matter, but it did frame my concerns about the future. I had no general pattern of looking after my health until I was 30 (q.v.). I have been concerned less about longevity than about pain and discomfort, having inherited a mild version of a digestive disorder. I was a casual smoker until I was 28, gave up all alcohol at 30, became a vegetarian at 48, and gave up sugar in beverages at the same age. The latter was largely influenced by dental health -my generation (and those older) had good reason to be afraid of dentists, and I wanted to minimise the need for treatment. I have been conscious of the need for greater roughage and the minimisation of processed foods. The event that did change my outlook was the sudden death of my father, through a heart attack, at the age of 64. My father was an ultra-heavy smoker, and when I raced down to ask my then GP whether I too would only live to 64, he pointed out that if I did not smoke at all, I could expect to live a lot longer than my father. (His mother, also a lifelong heavy smoker, survived him and lived to 91). I would trace concerns for my health from that time, but I would experience this mostly in terms of diet than some sort of fitness concern or regime. I was greatly affected when my first wife died of cancer, but it did not feel that this was something that could happen to me; I had somewhat underestimated the danger to her health presented by a long-term condition. I have become much more conscious of mortality since that time – and more worried. I do check online life expectancy calculators, which suggest that I will still be around in my 80s or beyond. My main concern is for my second wife's health, and the need for me to be able to look after her should she become ill or infirm. I anticipate taking greater care over what I eat, in the future. With regard to mental health and wellbeing, I already find the prospects of old age, further bereavements, growing infirmity and unrealised ambitions and fulfilment as quite daunting, and I suspect that I will find these worsening as I and others age. I'm not sure if these concerns can be placed under categories of mental health and wellbeing, nor that there are any cures or amelioration. I will find out! Health, wellbeing and appearance I think I have covered many of my views on appearance above. B7418 I think that far too much emphasis is placed on appearance, and often external appearances can mislead. I do not feel that I have been influenced by popular ideas about personal physical appearance, although I have to confess that one signifier, that I am a decided non-conformist who is no longer in employment, is that I have a long grey pony tail. I suppose this also seeks to tell myself (and others) that I am not too old to rebel against public assumptions as to how a man in his 60s should look! I'm not sure if my parents were influenced by popular ideas or figures, but more by their class, and the way in which they presented themselves to their friends. My father was very self-conscious about their reactions ­he was particularly worried about whether he had shaved sufficiently. My mother had that odd practice of 'putting your face on' (q.v.). They were horrified by the reactions that their friends and families might have to any adverse appearance that I might present. My parents both came from middle-class backgrounds, and shared many of the inhibitions and insecurities about appearance that many middle-class people had into the 1960s. I think that one product I would need is moisturiser, but this is for dry skin and psoriasis (thus prescribed for medical purposes). Daktacort would be particularly useful! Getting ready to leave the house My father did go through a ritual before leaving the house to go to work. He would get up early, in dressing gown, make toast and tea, smoke, and then go into the bathroom and cough violently for several minutes. My mother would get up late -she was a housewife and didn't go out to work. No coughing from her, but she put on elaborate make-up, a great deal of face powder, and lipstick. My own routines vary, but in the morning I generally wash and get dressed, after sitting in the kitchen eating breakfast (which I make). I sometimes lay out clothes the night before. I always do dress in outside clothes; I do not sit around in pyjamas or dressing gown. I would not describe any of this as a ritual. What has changed since the time that I was employed is that I wear more casual clothes; before retirement I would always wear a jacket and tie for work. It is also the case that my late first wife was very particular about clothes and would often expect my appearance to conform to her ideals -rather fruitlessly, sadly! My second wife is not concerned about appearance -there is noone to impress -and we both dress accordingly. The only exception now would be if I was doing some sort of external lecture -I would 'dress up' for this, often with jacket and tie. This may seem odd, but I feel the need to differentiate myself from the audience."

Mass-Observer W7422 describes themself as female; age 45; cohabiting with children; academic librarian.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing The challenges of COVID-19 mean that in recent months, there has been a lot of reflection on health and wellbeing in unprecedented circumstances. But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Health to me means the quality of your physical and mental state – whether you’re suffering from any illnesses and how fit you are. Wellbeing to me means looking after your mental and physical states in order to ward off poor health, for example by taking exercise, eating tasty, nutritious food or spending time doing tasks you enjoy. That it’s often cloaked as “taking time for yourself”, to me implies that there’s something selfish about doing something for you and nobody else and therefore, it’s to be frowned upon. It’s only in recent years, that I’ve actively sought to do things that I want to do rather than things to help or please others. A healthy body: fit, glowing, happy, toned, energetic. Weirdly when thinking of the “healthy body”, I only ever imagine a woman in her early 20s, long brown hair, size 12-14, T-shirt and shorts, glowing tanned skin, running. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? My own experience of health and wellbeing has certainly been influenced by my gender, for example, the embarrassment and self-consciousness I felt doing PE at school, in a tiny pair of sports knickers whilst going through puberty, and with boys making leery comments, put me off of participating in sport for many, many years. Indeed, as an adult the first time I tried running to improve my fitness, I’d only been out of the house 20 seconds when two teenage boys started pointing and laughing at me. I just turned around and went back into the house and didn’t run outside again for well over a decade. I don’t for one second imagine they’d have behaved like that towards a man. For the same reason, it took me a while to find a gym I didn’t feel leered at in. Maybe it’s because I am now middle-aged and off the sexual radar of most men, but it’s been great to exercise without feeling objectified or ridiculed at my current gym! I’m also, as a woman, reluctant to go out in the dark alone for fear of being attacked, so I don’t have much time during the day, around work to fit outdoor exercise in, so it’s awkward during the current pandemic, with the gyms closed. Another major problem is related to sex (as opposed to gender). Many medical studies focus almost exclusively upon men, with the assumption that women’s bodies, cells, muscles, hormones etc. react in the same way as men’s – but they don’t. There are so many examples of drugs which don’t medicate women as well as men, for example, which begs the question, how many treatments have been dismissed because they don’t work on men, but haven’t even been tried on women? The most well known sign of a heart attack – pain in the left arm – isn’t actually that common in women, and women are often denied treatment because typically female signs of a heart attack aren’t being recognised. I am on blood thinners and statins following a TIA 2 ½ years ago, and I do worry that they’re not benefitting me as much as a man in the same situation. An image went viral a couple of years ago of the milk ducts in a woman’s breast. It went viral because nobody had seen it before – it’s so staggeringly rare to see this kind of image of a woman, and yet we all have this inside us, and most mothers will have produced milk in them! They’re hardly an obscure part of the body! If you see images of the biological structure of a human body, beyond the reproductive system, they’re almost always male. This is also the case in academic textbooks, so it’s no wonder doctors are often ignorant about women’s health when they’re not being taught about it! And again, related to sex, I’m currently peri-menopausal, as are many of my friends, but trying to uncover information and advice beyond mention of hot flushes is incredibly difficult! I’ve friends whose GP has just responded with “it’s normal, you just have to put up with it”, when they can’t function due to brain fog and exhaustion, providing no information let alone medication, about anything that may help. Even just trying to find more biological detail about what’s happening to my body, in a similar way as you get about puberty, is proving impossible – that information just seems non-existent. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? I don’t remember when I first became conscious of “health”, but “wellbeing” is a recent term, although the concept of taking time for yourself is old. Certainly, as a child my mum was very conscientious in ensuring I washed my hands after going to the toilet, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, bathed, and brushed my hair! She was very strict in not allowing us to wear other people’s hats for fear of nits. It paid off – I never had nits and at 45 I’ve still no fillings! I’ve no recollection of being educating about health and wellbeing at school, other than the nit nurse coming around, disinfectant trays at the swimming pool to help prevent verrucas and later learning about puberty. My mum told me about puberty in advance of the lessons at school – I’m presuming that was prompted by a letter home. Somehow, I was completely oblivious to anything at all to do with menstruation and sex, so it all came as quite a shock! I’d never noticed the sanitary products in the bathroom cabinet or supermarket, and jokes and reports on the TV or in the papers had gone straight over my head! Aside from the shock though, I mostly remember the horrible smell of a small book my mum had got from a sanitary towel company, which still exists in the sanitary product aisle of my local Tesco and still makes me gag! It wasn’t a great introduction to womanhood! I never had a sex education lesson. Mum gave me a book by Claire Rayner about various aspects of the human body, for example, following a raisin through the digestive system. The final chapter though was about reproduction, and frankly, it scared the life out of me! The illustrations really made me feel very uncomfortable, and made me very nervous of sex and the attentions of men going into puberty myself. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? After mum had told me about puberty, I started noticing my body was changing. I’d initially noticed what felt like 10ps under my nipples when I was about 8 or 9, with pubic hair following soon after. I remember feeling very self-conscious as time progress and my breasts grew larger, and I desperately didn’t want to grow up. Key moments were buying my first bra, which mum managed to make into a frankly, humiliating experience as she started measuring me in the middle of a busy M&S where everybody could see what was going on, and insisted I wore a really horrible white bra like an old woman would wear, and not the coloured, teenagers’ one I’d preferred. (I never wear white underwear now!) I certainly wasn’t the mother-daughter bonding experience some people have! My first period was less traumatic, although I was very disappointed by its arrival when I was 13. I irritatedly, left the bathroom said to mum, “Guess what?”, she gave me some sanitary towels and we didn’t discuss it again. A key personal moment though occurred shortly after I’d had my appendix removed when I was 16. Needing to pull my knickers up tightly to hold the sanitary towel in place, I asked mum to get me some tampons as my knickers were rubbing on the incision stitches and were very uncomfortable. In all honesty, it wasn’t as bad as I was making out, but I’d had enough of the unhygienic nappy feeling of towels and wanted to wear tampons. Mum absolutely freaked and started claiming that tampons would take my virginity. Then came an almighty row during which I called out her lie, which she didn’t like. She did eventually go to the shop, but rather than buying tampons inexplicably returned with one of those old-fashioned sanitary belts! Even in 1991 I couldn’t imagine when on earth the local shop had bought those in! The mid-1950s, surely! I was livid, and eventually she gave in and bought me tampons. However, I was so angry and tense I couldn’t insert one, so was forced back to the grotty towels. It did have a serious impact upon my already ropey relationship with my mum, as I simply couldn’t trust her anymore. After that I started using my own money to buy myself tampons. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I’ve done little for most of my adult life to actively maintain my health, maintaining high hygiene standards, but really doing little regular exercise and although I have always eaten mostly healthy food, I’ve also eaten a lot of sweets and crisps and drunk a lot of alcohol. I really have been fortunate not to have piled on weight. During my late teens and early 20s I worked in shops and spent much of the day on my feet, rushing around, so I think that probably helped keep the weight off. Once I gained my first job as a librarian, I became almost entirely desk-bound, so started putting on weight. Shortly after this I joined a gym, but as often happens, my initial enthusiasm waned, life got in the way and made it awkward to visit and once I fell pregnant with my first child I stopped going for a few years. 2 ½ years ago I had a TIA and whilst there’s been absolutely no indication of what on earth caused it – I don’t smoke, I was slightly overweight, but not enough to be triggering strokes, my blood pressure was fine, bloods and heart fine, it did scare me. The occupational therapists encouraged me to get more exercise, and whilst I was initially fearful of my heart rate increasing too much in case it caused another stroke (a totally imagined fear!), I started doing the 0-5k running programme, which worked a treat, until the weather got too hot and I couldn’t bear to run in the heat! After that I joined the local gym. Recovery from the TIA also made me more aware for the first time since I had children (and therefore had less time for myself), of the importance of my own wellbeing, and of the need to relax and spend time doing tasks I enjoy doing and which distract my mind from my worries. Consequently, I’ve got far better at refusing to do things I don’t want to do, and actively taking time to do things I want to do, and if others wish to join me, all the better, but I’ve been prioritising myself for once. It has also made me more conscious of my body, and when I can maintain a routine it’s relatively easy for me to regularly exercise and to eat (mostly) healthily. Unfortunately, during the Covid pandemic I’ve found it very difficult to maintain that routine, and my strongest desire when I’ve time away from work is to read, research my family tree, or sew – something I can do quietly on my own, curled up in a comfy chair. I do need to start undertaking more exercise, as I am putting on weight and I am concerned that it’ll impact upon my health. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I think there’s definitely a relationship between health and wellbeing and external appearance – you can often tell when people are ill or depressed by their physical appearance or demeanour, but I don’t think it’s a given that if you look healthy you are. Many people who exhibit that healthy glow are struggling with their mental health and when I had the TIA, you’d never have known it’d happened because I seemed, even to me, healthy and happy! When it occurred, I was less stressed than I’d been for a long time, so eternal appearance isn’t always a good indicator of health and wellbeing. I do feel I’m influenced by popular ideals, in that I’d love to have a flat stomach and achieve that healthy glow. I pluck my eyebrows and remove unsightly hairs, pre-Covid I always wore make-up outside of the house, but I don’t feel the need to have Botox, colour my eyebrows in with a marker pen or cover myself in fake tan, as many people currently are. Although, I do feel better about myself when I do have a slight tan, maybe that’s just the benefits of getting the sun on my skin and a Vitamin D boost! I’ve never been particularly interested in fashion and am aware I dress quite conservatively and dully. Much of that is down to having had a lack of money to spend on clothing throughout the years, so I tend to buy clothes I know I’ll get plenty of wear from and can wear both to work and around home, and the plainer they are, the less self-conscious I’m likely to feel as they get older. My parents definitely weren’t influenced by popular ideals. Mum made the mistake in her teens of shaving the small amount of hair she had on her top lip, and has spent the last 55 years trying to tackle that, which is probably as far as she goes with beauty ideals. Dad regularly visits the barber, but again, little more! There are two health and beauty products I couldn’t live without: a firm Reach toothbrush and any Colgate toothpaste. I am 45 with no fillings and I’m convinced these products have played a huge part in that! If my desert island items need to be health and beauty-related, I’d choose the Reach toothbrush and Colgate toothpaste; if not I’d go for a full Kindle and means of charging it. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I don’t remember too much about my parents getting ready to go to work or out. Really it was the basics for both, little extra effort when they were off out. Dad worked shifts, so on earlies he’d get up about 5.00, go straight downstairs and set a full kettle going, chuck some teabags in the teapot and get the ingredients out for his sandwiches, before heading upstairs for a shower. He’d dress, come down make a tea, breakfast, packed lunch and flask of tea, head up to clean his teeth then head to work. On lates he’d grab some lunch, make a packed tea, get changed for work, clean his teeth and head out. Then going for a night out, he’d shower, shave (usually cutting himself and covering his face in bits of toilet paper to mop up the blood), put on his clothes, add a splash of after shave and clean his teeth. Dad always cleans his teeth right before he leaves the house. Mum would usually have a million things to sort out before going to work, such as my sister and I, so after showering, cleaning her teeth, dressing, eating her beloved Shredded Wheat for breakfast, making our packed lunches and ensuring we were ready and had everything, she’d take us to school then head to work. Going out, she’d usually shower, clean her teeth, dress, add a minimal amount of makeup and a splash of perfume, then head out. There’s certainly no all afternoon preparations with either of them – so long as they look presentable, that’s fine. I don’t think I’m hugely different. One odd thing though, is that if they’re going out in the morning, they don’t initially put on the clothes they’ll wear for the day. So, if they’re heading out say, 10am, they’ll put on clothes when they get up, say, 7am, but will then change before going out at 10am. I’ve never understood this. Sometimes they change clothes after just an hour! It seems pointless to me. At least they don’t immediately put the 7am clothes in the wash. My pre-Covid weekday routine was to wake about 6.45, brush my teeth, shower (always shaving my armpits and shampooing and conditioning my hair), wash my face, dry, moisturise, dress, brush my hair, head downstairs, put on the kettle, make packed lunches for myself and F, make a cup of tea, make poached eggs on toast for breakfast, nag F to get into the shower, make F’s breakfast, nag F to sort out his school bag and brush his teeth, put on some makeup, shoes and coats on, take F to school, then head to work. This has changed since L started at secondary school in Sept 2020, as I previously had them both to chivvy along in the mornings, but as L now needs to leave the house earlier to catch the bus, D has been getting up and into the shower before me and sorting him out. Before children, my routine was much the same except for there being no nagging of children. Socialising, my routine is much the same. I may shower before heading out, but probably not, I’ll likely make do with putting on more deodorant, washing my face, re-doing my make-up – I may put on some heavier eye makeup – brushing my hair, sometimes trying and failing to style it in some way, put on my going-out clothes, sometimes wearing heels which I rarely wear during the day, grab a little handbag which again, I don’t use day to day, and head out. This routine has changed very little over the years. JS/KP Autumn 2020 Directive/No. 120"

Health, wellbeing and the healthy body Health, to me, largely means physical health. Wellbeing is more to do with one’s mental state. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”?

Isle of Wight School support/housewife Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I’m female, white, straight and working class. It will have affected my health experience and how it has been treated. Certainly the fact my husband has a good job has meant I have not had to work full time since our son arrived 19 years ago. As time has gone along my health has deteriorated, having several chronic health conditions. I had worked as an administrator in the NHS, but due to a chronic bad back I simply couldn’t do the job anymore so I resigned. I know other people in a similar situation have had to carry on in pain because they couldn’t afford to leave work. The same goes for my wellbeing. I know I am very lucky to have a husband who would rather I was not suffering physical pain by having to work when he knows how much that affects my wellbeing. He is an absolute rock to my mental health. I suppose my social class has had an effect too. The class system, in this country, I believe will never go away. I’m working class because my husband works. However, even working class has its own separate sub divisions depending on what kind of job you have and what you can afford. I have been able to go to the gym to try and maintain any physical health I still have (whilst they were open!) and certainly as a child I was afforded the chance to take part in activities such as dance and any clubs I wished to join which would have been good for my mental health. Isle of Wight School support/housewife Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? We did PE in school which was simply part of the curriculum. I don’t think I ever really was aware of it is being a healthy thing to do. At primary school I enjoyed it, but moving on I absolutely hated it. With my physique, I was never going to be an athlete! I would say teachers had a big influence on my wellbeing and choices of how to be healthy. I had one teacher who would use me as the example pupil of how not to do things. Not a great way to improve someone’s wellbeing. If anything, his lack of encouragement made me dislike any physical activities at all. I had only one PE teacher at secondary school who took an interest in the pupils who “couldn’t” rather than those that “could”. She really boosted my mental wellbeing, confidence and attitude to healthy pursuits. She encouraged us so much and in the one year she was my PE teacher she really built up my stamina. I went from being one of the students who would splash around pathetically in the baby pool whilst the athletic ones were diving and swimming lengths to one who could swim nearly 40 lengths in one lesson. She had taught me to focus on what I could do rather than what I couldn’t. I can still remember the students good at PE being somewhat put out that she praised us for what we could do rather than those that were naturally talented all the time. My mother sent me to dance classes as a child which I attended at least two or three times a week. I didn’t always like it, but it never occurred to me not to go! In later years my mother told me she had sent me to try and build up some muscles on my body, in particular my legs. They were like sticks although I have to say she never ever criticised or body shamed me as she had been the Isle of Wight School support/housewife same physique as a child and didn’t want me to go through the same bullying as she had as a child. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? I would say 100% my parents. If anyone else chipped in I would say it was only because my parents asked them to. I never felt anything other than completely safe and loved by my Mother and Father. That’s a pretty good memory to leave an offspring isn’t it? I wasn’t a particularly sickly child, but I did have a weight problem which my parents never made an issue of. My mother, at the recommendation of the doctor, gave me any “naughty” food I wanted because I just didn’t grow and I was so thin. My mum used to to tell me I was slender as I was growing up, she never called me skinny and we never had any arguments about what I did or didn’t eat. She always looked out for my mental wellbeing and boosted my self esteem. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? I don’t really remember my parents talking about my health directly. I think my Mum was a very clever parent! If I was ill she’d take care of me physically and mentally. I had a routine operation in hospital as a young teenager and became dangerously underweight whilst I was there. I was always underweight anyway and I certainly didn’t have any reserves to get any smaller. The food was absolutely disgusting and one day I even had a huge earthworm in my salad. I existed on crackers and cheese for three weeks. My Nan would smuggle Isle of Wight School support/housewife strawberries and cream in too which was probably the only thing that kept me alive. My parents must have been beside themselves with worry as I was under three stone and not healing. Looking back on it I know I would never have mentally coped if the same situation had occurred with my son. They never showed their concerns to me. I was always such a worrywart (and still am) that it wouldn’t have done me mentally any good to realise how ill I was. In the end I was discharged because it was clear staying in hospital was making me worse. Within two months of being back home, and a lot of input from my parents, my mental health and physical health were back to normal. I do remember the “facts of life” chat which naturally in those days came from my mother! She got a book out of the library and let me read it before asking me if I had any questions. I know I never discussed things like that with my father. When my own son got to that age I told my husband he could do it, but my son came up with something wrong that children so often do and we had a perfectly normal conversation about it then and there. Even to this day he will rather ask me the “embarrassing” questions than mention something to my husband. My son knows I am very matter of fact about issues like that and I like to think that that was something I got right. Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? We had the “facts of life” at primary school, but my Mum had already covered that so it came as no shock. I can still remember watching the TV programme about giving birth and can even hear in  my mind the Scottish presenter saying it takes about 40 weeks to grow a baby which is as long as starting school in September until Whitsun holiday. One poor girl was actually sick watching it! In secondary school the PE teachers did “the talk” in just one lesson. Lots of embarrassment blushing and silly questions. Girls and boys obviously taught in separate classes. Nowadays, I know PSHE is on the curriculum far more than Isle of Wight School support/housewife just the one lesson. I don’t ever remember being taught about our mental health and wellbeing in school and I think it’s a good thing that it has been recognised as being something important so that children have the opportunity to grow up as well rounded healthy individuals who can thrive and contribute to society. I did learn a little from friends and it was only through a friend that I learnt fully about periods and had to go and ask my Mum to check the facts. I guess my Mum just thought I wasn’t old enough and didn’t really to know that bit yet. Ironically, when that friend started her periods it was my Mum she came to see what to do rather than her own mum. I suppose my age group did have magazines such as Jackie and later on Just 17. I don’t know that it really taught me anything, but I do remember reading the problem page “Cathy and Claire” in Jackie and knowing that some of the problems my age group were going through were normal. By the time I’d graduated onto Just 17 the problem page was interesting, but bore little resemblance to the safe life I was living. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I was something of a late developer being so small and I was probably one of the last in my year to hit puberty. I wasn’t in any rush anyway, but I did find it annoying that I didn’t have an excuse to miss going in the showers after PE! Actually, I think I probably lied once a month just to look normal. Isle of Wight School support/housewife Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? My Mum bought my first bra long before I needed one. She told me it was a modesty bra, and I would one day have something to put in there. It was something she did to increase my self esteem. I don’t think I really needed one until I was about 16. Getting your period was an incredibly important thing as a young girl and you didn’t fit in with your peers fully until you got it. I had to wait a very long time, but I was very prepared for it carrying around the necessary products for at least 4 years before I needed them. When I did get my first period I remember feeling quite special and at last I was normal. Ironically my mother was away on holiday and I felt quite disappointed that I couldn’t tell her about it, and being so far behind my friends I didn’t dare tell them. I think for a lad, their voice breaking is an awkward but important thing on their journey into adulthood. My brother’s voice broke speaking just two words. My dad came in from work and my brother said “Hello Dad”. The first word came from a child the second started high, then cracked higher and finished down in his boots as a man! He blushed, we all laughed together rather than at him and I think he was quite pleased especially as he got over it in one sentence. I remember my son starting to shave. We bought him an electric razor. A long time later he asked why my husband had never taught him to wet shave. We reminded him that he was always late when going out and electric shaving meant he could multi-task! Isle of Wight School support/housewife Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I do enjoy walking and it is something I can do for quite a long period of time. With my bad back I have to be careful with what I can do and there is a fine line between over exercising and doing just enough. I used to do keep fit, which I did really enjoy. It was good for my mental health too as it was very sociable and I met several very good friends through it. Sadly it is not something I can safely do now. Mentally keeping fit has not always been so easy. I am a worrier so I choose pastimes that I can really absorb myself in. Before I hurt my back I did enjoy gardening. I could totally lose myself in just doing a bit of weeding. Nowadays I do a lot of crafting. I know it has become a bit of a national obsession with making things especially during lockdown, but I was into crafting long before Kirstie Allsopp was on TV singing the praises of craft! I love crochet as I can stand, sit or even lie down doing it. I also love sewing, but I have to be careful not to sit at my sewing machine for too long. I can’t really say what triggered my sudden passion to start crafting, but it has developed over the years and has certainly helped my mental health and gives me a feeling of wellbeing when I achieve something. It can also be counter­productive when things go wrong though. My sewing machine was nearly defenestrated when it kept jumping stitches on a facemask I was making last year, so I have to know when to stop and come back to it or I’ll feel more agitated than when I started. Crafting has also led to something else that has greatly improved and maintained my sense of wellbeing. I enjoy crafting, but I do like to at least have a reason for making something. I discovered a few competitions locally and it Isle of Wight School support/housewife has given me the impetus to take part and try to make things that I would never normally have considered. As I wanted to develop my interest further I found a local WI that was very proactive in crafting and this has made a huge difference to my wellbeing. This has been even more important during the lockdowns as we have kept in touch with each other through “zooming” at least once a week either having a chat or playing beetle drive or bingo. I’m not a massive fan of social media, but it has been an absolute godsend for mental health to keep in touch with close friends. It’ll never take the place of real contact, but in these times it at least softens the blow and makes us realise that people are still there even if we can’t physically touch them. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? I suppose without realising I get a lot of information from the TV and the internet. Being a worrier I do NOT consult Dr Google, he has no qualifications at all! I do, however, look on the NHS site for health issues. I will watch documentaries on health issues such as weight and mental wellbeing. I think the campaign saying “it’s OK to not be OK” has lessened the stigma of mental health issues and also possibly broadened the ideas of what people consider to be a mental health issue. Not that many years ago, people’s idea of what it was to have a mental health issue would not have included anxiety or low mood. If someone was depressed then it would not have been talked about. I think we are less fearful to ask how someone is when not necessarily thinking of their physical health. I also keep up to date with medical issues that affect me through specific magazines (e.g. the national Osteoporosis magazine) or the national recognised websites. Isle of Wight School support/housewife Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I’m more aware of my body now as it ages and the aches and pains are increasing! I have osteoporosis which was diagnosed nearly 20 years ago. I put it to the back of my mind, but I am aware my body will begin to change and the disease may affect me more. I also have degenerative disc disease so I can’t see me “getting away with” no further complications to my spine as I get older. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I expect I will still worry. I can’t see that ever changing now. I will try and maintain what health I have and resist the medication to help with the pain as long as I can. I have a high pain threshold and I want to know there will be something I can take when it gets too bad. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? If you don’t feel good physically then it will affect your external appearance even if you try not to let it. When my back “went” for the second time I tried so hard to carry on as normal and, with hindsight, I should have stopped some of the things I was still trying to do. It was only when a work colleague told me I looked really rough and said I had to go the doctors that I listened and within 24 hours I was in hospital. If she hadn’t told me I probably would have tried to carry on. However, I do think with some mental illnesses it is possible to hide your inner feelings so nothing shows externally. I think the late actor Robin Williams was a prime example of someone who could disguise what was happening on the inside. He said “I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it's like to feel absolutely worthless and they don't want anyone else to feel like that.” Isle of Wight School support/housewife Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? I probably have been influenced unconsciously. I did note fashions growing up and recognised what were popular ideals of beauty. Although being slim has been the popular norm for many years I wasn’t slim, being brutally honest I was skinny and there was nothing I could do to conform to the ideal shape. As I’ve got older middle aged spread has crept in and I wish my GP would tell me now I could eat whatever I fancied without any concerns! My mother dressed classically and always wore clothes that suited rather than conform. My Dad was very thin too. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Before the pandemic I couldn’t possibly leave the house without lipstick on. I have incredibly pale lips and without a slap of “lippy” on I look dead. It has taken months to get out of the habit of popping upstairs to put some lipstick on before I go out. Nearly all of my homemade masks still have a lipstick mark on them although they are boil washed after every use. Before every zoom I still go and put some on! Lipstick would definitely be my desert island item. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? I loved watching my mother getting ready to go out for the evening. Her dressing table was wonderful, full of lots of lotions and potions and her makeup. She had a pot of moisturiser that smelt like limes and I always wanted to taste it, but never did. She also had different perfumes for evening or Isle of Wight School support/housewife daytime. In the evening she would wear Norman Hartnell perfume but during the day she wore Heaven Scent by Helena Rubinstein. It’s not made anymore, but I still have one bottle left and if I’m missing my mum (she died 14 years ago) one whiff will take me back to a feeling of safety. My mother stayed at home with the children once we arrived, but she would still ensure she was made up for the day and wouldn’t dream of answering the door without her face on. She always put on eye shadow and eye liner and, like me, lipstick. That’s probably where I got it from. My father was up and out in the morning pretty much at the last minute! Woe betides if anyone was in the bathroom when he needed to be in there as he always cut it so fine. He would get his breakfast ready the night before so all he had to do was to put the milk on his cereal in the morning. Mum always did his sandwiches the night before too. Mum and Dad also had a teasmade so that would wake them up. I always left for school or later on work before my Dad did so I never really saw much of any other rituals. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I only work part time and at the moment not at all because of covid restrictions. When I was working I would have to be first up even though my husband left for work before I did (he is working from home now). I always had to have a shower and wash and style my hair before going down for breakfast. If I was working I’d always put my face on, lipstick, foundation, eye shadow, mascara and eyeliner. I actually enjoyed getting ready for work and making an effort. Now I am working I’m still usually the first one up because I like to go and make my husband a cup of tea before he gets up. I also need to sort our dog out as he gets too excited with my husband in the mornings. Generally I go back to bed to drink my tea and then get up once my husband has gone to work (along the landing) to his office. When socialising my routine is quite similar. I’ll always have a shower and do my hair etc. Even now, with no physical socialising I will go and make sure I Isle of Wight School support/housewife look OK if I’m face timing with someone. I think it’s a bit disrespectful to look a mess and its better for one’s moral and wellbeing to feel good about yourself.

Of course I have had my off days, and certainly in the first couple of weeks, I couldn’t get through 24 hours without tears overtaking me -sorrow for people that we knew who I feared might not survive, for our lifestyle, our friends, our community, our church, and of course for our country. So much unknown, and so much fear. We had locked down a few days before it was officially the requirement, be­cause we are both over 70, and that was the advice at the time -don’t wait to be told; just do it, so on Monday and Tuesday 16 & 17 March 2020 we walked into town together ( unusual to go together, but there was a sense of something a little momentous ) and bought all sorts of odd things we thought we would need, including toiletries and make up to last 3 months. Why on earth did I think I would be bothering with make up?? We also arranged to have The Observer delivered every Sunday, and the local paper which comes out on Saturdays would be delivered with it, and I set up internet banking so I would be able to pay my credit cards bills even if we could not go out. We have always had a milkman and I booked us into an organic veg­etable bag delivery service. A bit more expensive, but I have been fortunate not to have to worry about a few extravagances during lockdown -no gym fees, no hair cuts every 4 weeks to offset them against. I always keep a good store cupboard, and we still have the Brexit Bunker to fall back on, so when we locked down, we felt we had done all we could to prepare ourselves for what might lie ahead. I do think that helped with my well-being, having that reassurance that we had made positive preparations, chosen to lock down before we were or­dered to do so, and felt we would be able to cope. It also helps that we have a large enough house that we are not under each others feet all the time -we have been married for nearly 51 years, but we have lots of separate interests and we were not used to living in each other’s pockets. I should say we used to have lots of separate interests, because life has closed down, closed in on us and we are at home together far more than we have ever been. The Government You ask for my thoughts on the political decisions that have been taken ­where shall I begin? To set the record straight, I am a passionate Remainer, (now we call, our­selves Rejoiners) and have been on several of the big protest marches in London. I didn’t vote Conservative, I am a Libdem, but in the December 2019 GE I lent my vote to the Labour candidate who, it seemed at the time, stood more chance of getting into this very Tory constituency than the LibDems. Much good that did us, as despite serious splits in the local conservative party after our MP Rory Stewart was thrown out of the Party. The candidate dropped into the constituency by Tory Party HQ, known to no-one, never been an MP before, was elected. The Government’s decisions on CV-19 have been wrong from the very begin­ning. Johnson is too much influenced by Trump, in style and in politics. This country and others had weeks of warnings from events in China and then in Italy, but precious time was lost, and even when the inevitable was upon us, there was no organisation, no strategy. My journal for 3 March records ’ 51 cases in UK now and we know this shit shambles of a govt has no real plans to cope, no mental capacity to organise a coping strategy.’ ( Sorry about the language -that has been one very notable effect of Brexit and CV19 for me!) One of the many problems with this govt* is that cabinet posts were given to Brexiteers, who were loyal to the ideology, and usually far from competent to hold such posts. Decisions have always been Brexit first, anything else sec­ond or third, and that includes coping with CV-19. No clear messaging, de­spite Johnson’s penchant for 3 word slogans. So we had ‘Stay at home, don’t go to work’, swiftly followed literally in his next breath by ‘ Go to work if you have to’. This confusion has been repeated time after time -‘Wear a face mask.’ ‘Don’t wear a face mask’, then ’Face masks will be compulsory in shops ‘ until Gove was seen coming out of Pret a Manger or similar with food but not wearing a mask, and then it was ’Face masks will be compulsory in shops, but not in takeaways ‘. Then ‘You don’t have to wear a face mask if it makes you feel uncomfortable’ . In other words -do what you want. And of course, that is just what Dominic Cummings did, and got away with it. What sort of message is that for the general public? No wonder young peo­ple are holding illegal raves and parties. I don’t approve of them but under­stand their frustrations. With regard to easing the lockdown, it really has been Wealth before Health ­‘Get businesses back to work’, and then this last week ‘Go back to work ‘ sub text being ‘Save the coffee shops and takeaways from going under’. And then there are the lies -lie after lie -often about PPE -supplies, orders, deliveries -any aspect of PPE has had several versions, and even now, we don’t know that we have been told the truth. Lies about statistics, lies about scientific advice, lies about where Johnson was and what he was doing. I no longer trust anything this regime says. If they told me it was raining, I would look out of the window to check. This is not a good situation to be in. And the public money wasted, with contracts awarded, without going to ten­der ( which is allowed under their emergency powers legislation) to inappro­priate companies, whose owners happen to be friends and relatives of minis­ters, MPs and Tory donors. The level of corruption is terrifying in the ease and blatant complacency with which it has been done. The emergency pow­ers assume that relevant companies will be awarded contracts, not one for PPE to a confectionery manufacturer. Govt steps in future months -more of the same I fear. They will urge the public to return to what used to be normal, some will; others like me will re­main cautious. When the second wave of CV19 hits, as I fear it will, it will be everyone and anyone else’s fault, not the govt’s. You will have gathered that I am so very angry about this dysfunctional incompetent govt. * govt -I think so little of them they are not worthy of the full word, and in fact I often refer to them as the Regime, because that is what they are, not a government at all. News We gave up watching any news coverage on BBC some time ago, finding them more a govt mouthpiece than an impartial news service. We watch an occasional BBC LookNorth in NE and Cumbria. Our main source of News is Channel 4 at 7pm, which we find is more in depth and its reporters do chal­lenge incorrect statements from govt ministers. This is probably why the govt has not allowed any ministers to be interviewed on Ch4 news for weeks, but they are shooting themselves in the foot because Ch4 always announce that they asked for a govt spokesperson but none was ‘available’. Ch4 always adds how long it is since anyone was ‘available’, thus making the govt look afraid or guilty, or both. Otherwise, it is the Observer on Sundays for both of us, the Guardian on-line and The New European for me, emails from Inews and other organisations, and also, Twitter. Daughter in Law was horrified when I said this, but I am careful with the provenance and who I follow. I first learned about the corrup­tion involving the Referendum and Cambridge Analylitica from Twitter. Because our opinion of the govt was already so poor we made a conscious decision NOT to watch any of the 5pm briefings during the height of the pan­demic in UK. From what we have heard, seen and read since, we have missed some dire performances by Matt Hancock, and Johnson and the hu­miliation of our national senior nurse, and assorted scientific advisers. We get the gist of the briefing later from Guardian on-line or Ch4 news. No problems with access to the news -but we do sympathise with those who needed sign language . Since this Directive was issued, sign language inter­preters have been present at the briefings ( and the briefings themselves have now finished). It is, however, a sad indictment of the contempt this govt has for people, that it had not occurred to them that sign language was nec­essary. There is a similar issue with the wearing of face masks, in that they prevent people with a hearing loss from lip reading. I don’t have the answer to this -but the question itself did not even register with the govt. Again -uncar­ing and contemptuous of the people whose well being is the govt’s responsi­bility. Work and Home Life We are both retired and so have not been working from home. However, pre­lockdown we led busy and fulfilling lives which have just gone on hold, but we are beginning to wonder if we really want to return to the voluntary activities in which we were so involved. Husband was a member of the Town Council. He is a bit of a technophobe and the problems of accessing Microsoft Team for meetings and the council’s own email system on our iMac were very stressful and far from satisfactory. In fact, we have had two periods of several weeks without access to our iMac, for unknown reasons -but we suspected the problem was caused by the installation of two Microsoft programmes for Husband’s Town Council work. Our new best friend for a long time was a senior Apple adviser based in Portugal. We managed personal emails and internet access with my iPad mini, but no means of writing replies to this MO directive (hence long time taken to reply) and nothing for Husband’s Town Council work. Just last week he decided enough was enough -there were other factors involved -and he resigned as a local councillor. A great shame in may ways, as he had a lot to offer. A tribute from the Deputy Mayor in our local paper last Saturday in­cluded .. ‘He mixes friendliness, kindness, diligence and attention to detail and I hope his example of reasoned and respectful debate will be long remembered in these halls. ‘ A wonderful and well-deserved comment. We are both members of our local methodist church and were regular attend­ers. We had both held various voluntary posts within the church, and alt­hough Husband had stood down from his, I was still on the wider leadership team, with various responsibilities, and I often went down to do things in the building during the week. All that ended with lockdown, and at first, that was one of my sadnesses. I made a list of people I intended to phone regularly ­not all from church, but a lot were. I even turned it into a sort spread sheet so I could keep a record of when I had phoned each person, but I soon found that without seeing the church friends every week, and having no church things to discuss, I had very little to say to them. To be fair, this was also the case with other friends -after you’ve asked ‘How are you?’ when no-one is going anywhere or seeing anyone, what else do you say? We have been participating in a live streamed service on YouTube from Cen­tral Methodist Hall in Westminster most Sundays and in a shorter service also YouTube from an anglican church in the West Midlands which our son and his family attend. The biggest draw at first was occasionally seeing him on screen when he had been recorded taking part in the service, but we have come to enjoy that short simple service every much. I shall not be in a hurry to return to services at our local church when they are eventually resumed. ( Probably mid August, and very short meditational services, no singing, no coffee and chat afterwards. Our Superintendent Minister reminds us that over 70s are still advised not to attend, but it is our own decision. ) As I have indicated previously, we are not used to being in each other’s com­pany all day and all evening, but we do have a large enough house in which to get away from each other…….. and then there is the garden -quite large, and challenging, as much of it is a steep bank, a herbaceous border with shrubs and large-ish stones, about 45 feet across and 10 steep feet deep. Then there are two side borders, another bed in front of the sitting room french doors and a small veg and soft fruit patch. That’s all behind the house. The front garden is also sloping ( we do live in hilly Cumbria after all) and is covered with gravel, planted with shrubs and lavender mostly inherited from the previous owners . I have never liked gardening in the front garden, neither here, nor at our previous house, so this is pretty much left to itself apart from necessary weeding, occasional pruning and the annual lavender cutting back after flowering. I am the gardener and spend many hours work­ing away. It sometimes seems an endless battle against the weeds, brought in by the wind and the birds but it is also my Happy Place, and I would rather garden than do housework. Husband mows the lawn, in which he takes great pride, raking first to remove the thatch, then mowing. He even goes round the edges on his hands and knees with little hand clippers. So during this lockdown, it has been easy to keep some spaces for ourselves. How we will get on if lockdown continues into the autumn and winter remains to be seen! I would like to mention Son here. His wife had what was first described as mild case of CV19, which was then ‘upgraded ‘ to a medium case. She is, in fact, one of the many who are what is known as long tail recoverers. She was ill in mid-March, and is still far from well, with severe chest pains & total lack of energy among her continuing symptoms. At the beginning, the whole fam­ily had to isolate, but Son continued to work from home until he was fur­loughed. For over 4 months he has been caring for his wife, and their chil­dren, including home schooling, running the house, shopping, cooking, laun­dry -everything, and all the while very anxious abut his wife’s health. We think he has been exceptional and used Father’s Day as an opportunity to send him a card telling him so. For us, the frustration has been being unable to help, except by sending treats and surprises via on-line shopping. Technology see also comments above in Work and Home Life. I am the more techy of the two of us ( which is not claiming much!) and make great use of my iPad mini for emails, Twitter and to a lesser extent Facebook. I am also responsible for our church’s social media, so run their Twitter and Facebook accounts as well as my own. What a godsend the iPad mini has been. I took the decision to buy a new one just after lockdown began, using what would have been my Gym membership fees to offset the cost. I use it constantly -probably far too much, and try to limit my time especially on Twit­ter, where a couple of hours can pass without my noticing. We have Face-Timed with Son once or twice, but somehow it does not seem very successful -perhaps because his wife is too poorly ( see above) to par­ticipate fully. We use YouTube on our TV for the church services in which we participate, which is fine. I was asked to install WhatsApp on my phone to facilitate church affairs -but so far all all I have used it for was for chatting with a friend, in a rather artifi­cial atmosphere -a little like our experience with FaceTime, I now realise. Zoom is also fine -for my exercise class and I will be interested to see how I get on in a couple of weeks with a Zoom Church Council meeting. Our church has been holding Zoom coffee mornings but we have not bothered to join in. Shopping and Food Oh what a palaver it was trying to get online groceries! I was so annoyed with Sainsbury’s where I have been a loyal and regular shopper for many years, at our previous house and then when they opened a store here. When I tried to register for online shopping, there was no way of indicating that I was a regular shopper nor that I was over 70, the age group that the govt was recommending to stay at home. They were obviously overwhelmed by the de­mand. I could not even register for Sainsbury’s online shopping let alone get a delivery slot. In desperation, I turned to Tesco -not a store I like and as the nearest branch is about 20 miles away, the carbon footprint of deliveries is horrendous -Sainsbury’s is walking distance form home. Tesco welcomed me with open arms -but having registered, got my club card number etc, there were no delivery slots for the foreseeable future, so that was a complete waste of time. Nothing for it -we had to do our own shopping, with careful precautions. There’s an M&S Food just down the road -our corner shop! I went to their oldies’ hour once every two or three weeks. With milk being delivered daily , and our weekly organic vegetable bag, a breadmaker and just about enough flour and yeast to keep going and a good store cupboard, we managed very well. I come from a not very well off family and was brought up to keep a good store cupboard and to be able make a meal out of whatever you have. This has stood me in good stead throughout my life. The delivered weekly vegetable bag has thrown up a few challenges, and my starting point for our meals is ‘What do we have in the veg bag?’ I have aways enjoyed vegetarian meals -Husband less so, but he’s getting more used to them, partly through the veg bag and partly through concern for the environment, but we both still enjoy a good steak! I was surprised how many veggie cookery books I had accumulated, and what a lot you can do with a bag of chard. Since lockdown has eased, I have ventured out a little more and now go to our Booths supermarket ( northern equivalent of Waitrose) as well as M&S Food. The small local shops in town are open with precautions, so I go to the deli and the health food shop for other items, but I still try to go only every other week, and have been wearing my face mask, despite some stares from other shoppers. Now everyone will have to wear masks in shops so I won’t stand out as an odd bod. We have definitely drunk more alcohol during lockdown -a glass or two or three of wine with dinner most evenings. Husband beings to a wine club so there is always a good selection waiting to be drunk. We did drink quite a lot anyway ( yes, I know -we’re methodists, but lots of Ministers will have a drink these days. I recall leaving a very sticky Church meeting a few years ago and saying sympathetically to the minister that I was having a large cup of tea when I got home, to which he replied that I was welcome to it, but he was go­ing to have a large whisky! ) Entertainment and Leisure A recent addition to my week is an exercise class twice a week via Zoom. This has made a huge difference to me -some structure to my flabby week and some assistance to my equally flabby body. Pre lockdown I was exercis­ing three times a week in an early morning class -7.40 a.m and this Zoom class is the same teacher and a lot of my old classmates, not that we can see much of each other on a Zoom screen, especially on an iPad mini! This is not necessarily a bad thing. I am also enjoying doing a little bit Circle dancing -of one of my main pleas­ures. It is sort of international folk dances, but some are traditional and some have modern choreography -for example, we have recently danced to “When I’m 64’ ‘Let’s get together and feel all right’ and very recently to ‘Que sera sera’ and ‘We’ll meet again’. -a bit too sentimental for me, but you just go with the flow. In our current set up, we are 5 from our regular class plus teacher, so keep­ing to the limit of maximum of 6 persons from different households. The other class members were invited and we offered to rotate weekly, so that all could have a turn, but no-one else wanted to do it. Which is interesting -why not? FOGO-Fear Of Going Out ? We dance usually once a week in the open air, on a nearby village green, which is large enough for us to be away from the main users and not be a disturbance to them, although we have been favourably commented on in so­cial media as an added attraction to the green. There is also a very good cof­fee van, whose owner is known to us. And now so are his Cumberland sau­sage baps and bacon butties. We should have been there this morning, but the rain deterred us and we hoped to go this afternoon,(23/7/2020) but it’s still raining and the grass would be very wet, and not conducive to dancing. So I am determined to use this time to finish off this directive, even though I have spent most of the morning on Twitter exploring the depths of the Russia Re­port and corruption in the govt. Another of my hobbies is Scrapbooking -this is not sticking old birthday cards onto sugar paper pages, but an American concept of arranging your photo­graphs in a more meaningful and attractive way. I am years and years be­hind, especially with the individual books I am making for each of our 4 grandchildren. Last year, I went with a friend to new York and Chicago -we are both members of our local U3A, and both belong to the Art Appreciation and Architecture Groups, so the two of us went off with a packed itinerary of art gallery and special buildings. Lockdown has proved an ideal time to get sorting out the many photos from that 10-day trip and mint them in a special book. So far, I have nearly finished New York -Chicago still to tackle. it is time consuming and enjoyable, but again, our lack of access to our iMac held me up because I couldn’t print any photos for several weeks. Another scrapbooking project was for our bellringing tower. (More about bell ringing below) Luckily, I had brought home a rather random collection of pho­tos, newspaper cuttings etc a couple of weeks before lockdown, and bought a new album to mount them in. That has also taken some time and a bit of re­search as some items were undated, and did not always include names. This turned out to be interesting but it was a mixed blessing, because it reminded me of all the fun times we’d had on outings to ring at other places, meals at Christmas and New Year and any other opportunity, pushing to the back of my mind the occasions when I have come home and wept in frustration at my inability to pull a bell rope at exactly the right time and with exactly the right amount of effort, -and weakening my resolve to give it up. The scrap book was going to be my farewell gesture -more about this below. I often feel that I have wasted my lockdown time. I haven’t learned any new skills nor brushed up any old ones. As I mentioned previously, I am a church bell ringer, and usually ring at the parish church on a Sunday morning before trotting round the corner to our methodist church. I am NOT a good ringer, and have a love/hate relationship with the whole thing, but when we went into lockdown, I thought what a good opportunity to really learn a particular method I had been struggling with for ages. Methods are what we call the se­quences we ring. They are not tunes! Well, have I learned it? No, I have not. In fact, I have been re-assessing what I do with my life and deciding to give up several things, and bell ringing was one of them. So when it was decreed a couple of weeks ago that church bells could be rung again, in restricted cir­cumstance and for 15 minutes only, just before a service, and our Tower Captain emailed me to ask on which dates I would be available to ring, I told him I would not be ringing for the foreseeable future. I see now that I was al­ready hedging my bets, not coming straight out and admitting that I was going to hang up my rope. Last Sunday, I happened to be in the garden, and the time, the wind direction and the traffic noise were all in conjunction and I could just hear the great tenor bell being rung up, ready to start ringing, and I just thought -how can I give it up? Then a couple of chance emails from ringers ….and I now think I will return, if we are ever able to hold evening practices again. Meanwhile, I will get out my book of Methods and try to get my head round ringing Grandsire on bell number 3. I normally enjoy going to art galleries and live relays to our local cinema from National Theatre, RSC etc, but when such goodies have been on TV, I have not wanted to watch them, or be involved. This seems such a missed oppor­tunity, but I simply have not been interested. There is a similar reaction in my reading during lockdown. We are both great readers, Husband sits for hours and reads solidly -he is working his way through his collection of Josephine Tay novels at the moment -beautiful Folio society editions, which are one of his indulgences. He is also reading an A C Grayling massive tome on philosophy in between them. I am a disappoint­ment to myself with my reading in lockdown . My concentration has become very poor, and I am easily distracted -see comment on Twitter above. Would I have been like this if the pandemic had not been so badly managed in this country? Is my outrage the reason for my lack of concentrated read­ing? I do read The Observer and The New European every week pretty carefully, but my box of waiting-to-be-read books sits reproachfully on the landing, and is actually fuller now than it was at the beginning of lockdown, because I have still been buying books that seemed essential at the time, but less attractive now . Don’t get me wrong -I am still reading, but not as avidly as I used to. The books on feminist theology which I thought I would devour while I had no external distractions have not even been opened, but I’ve bought one or two more. The friendship between Wordsworth and Coleridge doesn’t seem that inter­esting any more. I'm about 1/3 of the way through The Friendship by Adam Sisman, and tell myself I’ll return to it eventually. I think I might skip a few chapters because it is really their lives in the Lake District that interest me ­but without reading most of the book, I won’t understand their close relation­ship which led to Wordsworth and Southey taking care of Coleridge’s family when he was off on a trip -in both senses of the word. Currently reading ‘1599: a year in Shakespeare’s Life’ by James Shapiro which is very good and I promise myself an hour with it when I have finished writing this. Other recent books read include Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty -not one I would have picked up, but recommended by Daughter, and very worth while. The author is a teenage autistic boy, pas­sionate and eloquent about nature. This book made me realise that we need people with autism to show us a different focus on the world -Greta Thun­berg, and Dara McAnulty. I think perhaps I was trying to trying to read books that are too ‘worthy’ and what I really need is escapist and comfort reading. I have really enjoyed a bit of a Kate Atkinson fest, with ‘Life after Life,’ and ‘A God in Ruins’. Her ‘Hu­man Croquet’ sits waiting but I am going to finish 1599 first, which I am en­joying very much. I have been gardening a lot, as I have already mentioned, and at the begin­ning of lockdown we were walking round the local lanes and field paths regu­larly. Hardly at all now, and it sometimes hard to say how the day has passed. That is one of the strange aspects of this lockdown-Time is so fluid. Note to self -look for a book on time/space continuum. Some days seem to be endless, and then suddenly, the week has passed and it is Friday again and the church bulletin is emailed to me and I post bits from it on the church Facebook page and print it out for Elderly Friend and one of us walks round to her house to deliver it and have a chat -no longer from the front garden through an open window -hurrah! We get up later -meals are later -usually watch a DVD in the evening. We have an extensive collection of DVDs as well as books and CDs. No wonder we need a big house for two of us, and have been watching whatever takes our fancy. Fairly early on in lockdown, we watched an old TV series which we have on DVD ‘Ever Decreasing Circles’ Richard Briers, Penelope Wilton and Peter Egan. That led to ‘What else was Peter Egan in?’ and we watched ‘A Perfect Spy’ which led onto the Alan Bennet play about Burgess ‘ An Englishman Abroad ‘ with Alan Bates as Burgess and Coral Browne playing herself. Then naturally we wanted to watch Alan Bennett ’s play about Anthony Blunt -the spy whose identity was kept secret because he was Keeper of the Queens’ Pictures. ‘A Question of Attribution’ is a beautiful piece writing from Alan Bennett, imagining a conversation between HM and Blunt. He was talking about one of her pictures which might be a fake -and we are left to surmise what HM was really referring to. Husband is very fond of Morse and Endeavour, and Inspector Frost -but I have seen them so often, that I don’t want to see them again for ages. My personal indulgence is Escape to the Chateau on Ch4 and its sequel Es­cape to the Chateau DIY. They are factual programmes, but highly edited, I am sure, -about how Dick and Angel Strawbridge are rescuing a derelict cha­teau and turning it into a successful business. He is an engineer and ex Lt Colonel and she is a very talented designer. I watched them all when first broadcast, but they are available on All4 and I am so enjoying watching them all again. I try to ration myself to one episode a day. I think the clue is in the first word of the title, and they are indeed my escape and relaxation. You cannot imagine my delight when somehow, without looking for it, I found on the internet some of Angel Strawbridge’s fabric designs. I didn’t even know you could buy them, so of course I ordered a metre which I will use somewhere, possibly in our revamped utility room -I must have watched too many episodes, because I announced to Husband that I thought we should knock down an internal wall in the utility room and re-arrange it. I even of­fered to knock the wall down myself if he got a big hammer -‘Yeah -with your arthritic hand?’ was his reply. How mean -but true. We are not DIYers. Husband has more or less given up an anything harder than changing a light-bulb, so we have had a man in from a local firm to take measurements and give us an estimate -it is bound to be a lot more than I expect. Our Personal Hygiene has not been affected at all by lockdown. We still shower/ hair wash in the way that we usually do. Sheets and towels changed every week. Husband decided this year that he could wear a shirt or t shirt for 2 days instead a clean one every day, unless strenuous activity had taken place ( unlikely) but I think that was before lockdown, because he does his own ironing. ( welcome to what was my world, dearest!) All I can say for myself is that I don’t wear any make up, and seem to be ro­tating the same few tops and jeans, especially now the weather here has turned quite chilly and I need a fleece over a long sleeve mid-season top. But everything is washed just as frequently as it always was. We are a bit per­nickety I suppose. Sleep Oh yes please! I have never been a very good sleeper. I can remember when I was a little girl aged between 5 and 8, not getting off to sleep and hearing one of my aunties talking about it to my dad downstairs. Was I per­haps staying awake to read the nursery rhymes on my bedroom wallpaper was her suggestion. No, there were no words, only pictures. Now, thinking back, I wonder if I was making up stories in my head about the pictures or re­citing the rhymes that I knew to myself?

Both retired, my previous occupation was as an academic in science education; husband was chemistry teacher. No children Written on 16 May We are staying pretty healthy. Husband has regular medication for hypertension and atrial fibrillation he had some years back. I take no medication – except occasional paracetamol for back pain. I had a bad back just before lockdown and went twice to the chiropractor – just a pity I can’t get any appointments now as my back continues to suffer somewhat. However, with doing Pilates 3 times a week – two of these as online Zoom classes – I’m am keeping any pain and irritation under control. Emotionally I have gone down and up – at the beginning of lockdown, I was pretty anxious – mainly about things like – would there be enough food; would the heating oil be delivered; would our friend who seemed to have Covid be alright. I like to be able to control things and any apparent lack of control can make be anxious (unlike my husband who doesn’t worry and thinks I’m worrying about nothing – he’s usually right and in these cases he was). So gradually fell into relaxed routine with lots of exercise, craft, reading etc. Whenever I go for a walk – most days – my mood lifts and I feel very happy. Recently I have got more frustrated and slightly angry because of the restrictions in not being able to do ‘normal’ things. However, generally we are managing well and feel very lucky in our situation – with a large garden, plenty of hobbies and home and space to do them in. Initially, I though the Government seemed to be handling the situation well – being very clear about what is expected and protecting the NHS. However, I (and particularly my husband) have become more cynical as time has gone on and more has been revealed about the underlying bureaucracy and government decision-making. (We both have left-wing tendencies.) For example – extracts from my diary: 22/4/20 ‘Immense criticism over lack of PPE in NHS & care settings, also testing still a problem.’ – this still continues now nearly a month on. 27/4/20 ‘PM back in no.10 – saying won’t sacrifice health of nation – we’ll see – hints of lockdown slowly lifting but real worries over care homes and lack of PPE generally.’ 1/5/20 ‘Jeremy Hunt was most hypocritical on Today programme this morning – claiming how good Health Secretary was in ramping up CV testing, and how important the social care sector is – SO WHY DID YOU DO NOTHING FOR THEM WHEN YOU WERE HEALTH SEC!’. 3/5/20 ‘Covid tracing app is to be trialled on Isle of Wight – we’re sceptical about it working.’ 10/5/20 PM changes guidance – this all now seems confusing. The latest news is about teaching unions being concerned about the scientific evidence behind government allowing schools to re-open, with specific measures being taken, possibly by 1 June. I tend to share the feeling, now more prevalent, that the Government is not handling the situation well – BUT the science is not clear so I can understand the mixed messages. BUT the Government seems to be an inner cabinet, acting for England alone, with little clear strategy. I suspect they are sticking to their right wing tendencies, and the hiatus with PM being out of action for a while with Covid hasn’t helped. The real test will be what happens in Brexit & US trade negotiations – it could be that next year, we will be in dire medical and financial straits through this Government’s handling of the situation. Though the Chancellor seems to come over as doing a reasonable job. It could be that Keir Starmer will really be a good opposition leader and hold Government to account – but not easy in the way Parliament currently runs via virtual means. Let’s just hope Parliament can bring some checks and balances to ensure it’s not a totalitarian right-wing management. I get most of my news from an hour of the BBC Radio Today programme in the morning; BBC News online a couple of times a day; ITV (or BBC) national and local evening news; occasional local papers in print or online. I have read quite a lot of the longer feeds on BBC news – in trying to compare the 1 Spring Directive Part 2 2020 Covid 19 R7467 situation in different countries. I watched the first few government briefings but have stopped doing that for the past three weeks or so – partly because it’s now just a political show to present Government in a good light and see how they manage difficult questions with a typical politician’s attitude. Having daily figures for cases and deaths can be misleading – do people understand that death figures are somewhat historical because they reflect the date of registration rather than the date of death? Because we are both retired, our home life has not been changed all that much. Yes, I’ve been frustrated at not going out to: pub quizzes with friends; my normal volunteering activities; shopping a lot; visiting local towns and pubs; walking in different places etc. But we have been able to keep very well occupied with hobbies, gardening, local walking and cooking. We’ve always been into using our laptops a lot – (that was one of my initial worries – what would happen if we lost internet connection/ hardware for any reason – how would we cope). So we have been doing a lot online. For example, watching theatre productions and lots of other interests on YouTube videos -in fact, via email and facebook I’ve seen so many suggestions that it’s impossible to watch them all (with the good weather it’s been great to be in the garden a lot anyway). One of the most uplifting clips early on was of the Corey band playing Chitty Chitty Bang Bang each from their own home. It has been fascinating to see how people have adjusted to operating in lockdown – for example ITV’s Isolation Stories (15 minute shorts) and Channel 4’s Grayson Perry’s art class have been really good. It is bringing out the creative in all of us. I continue to keep up with friends and family through Whatsapp, text, email and phone calls – just more frequently than before lockdown. Some local friends we happen to chat with when we see them walking their dog in the lane – and I’ve talked to people on the lane I’ve not met before when we’ve exchanged greetings when walking. I’ve used facebook more than normal, subscribing to some more local groups to follow activities in the nearby villages and towns – this has been very useful to see how local volunteering and infrastructure has adapted (it encouraged me to donate to local organisations to help with providing PPE). The one new platform for me has been Zoom – my Pilates teacher managed to get her classes going on this after a few weeks. So it’s good to have some online classes. I have been going shopping about once every 10 days – to a small local town -Aldi and the Co-op as they first open. Initially I was very frugal at home in looking at what we had in cupboards, planning meals carefully and starting to use up things I’d forgotten we had. I was a bit anxious the first time I did a large shop, because of seeing whether social distancing was working in these supermarkets but have now got into a routine which seems to work well. I prepare a clear shopping list – something I’ve rarely done before. (on local facebook page there has been a lot of discussion about how some shops and supermarkets are better than others at enforcing social distancing and that there are a lot of people who either don’t understand or don’t care about social distancing). I’ve managed to get most things I want – except, until recently, bread flour (I make my own sourdough bread). I have been going into a small shop in the next village for some things – they have installed a one-way system and I use contactless payment and hand sanitiser immediately after leaving the shop. We both went shopping this week, as my husband wanted to pick up his prescription and go into a hardware store. It’s the first time he’s been out for some time. But he won’t go shopping again for a while – mainly because of the queueing. I’ve felt reasonably safe while shopping because of the social distancing and using hand sanitiser. I’ve been more systematic about planning meals, being careful in making good use of fresh veg and fruit and using what’s in the freezer (freezing some meat on purchase). So I have a planner showing meals for the next week – something I’ve not done before and my husband really likes. Although I was frugal to begin with, and did seem to lose a bit of 2 Spring Directive Part 2 2020 Covid 19 R7467 weight, our eating habits are now back to normal (as the grocery supplies seem fine). But I’m retaining that planning and healthy eating approach. We’ve not been at all short of things to do. The house has been cleaner than ever. Not really hobbies, but we’ve done lots of things that have needed doing for a long time – for example, all the soft furnishings have cleaned; all the rooms and their contents tidied. We’ve done a lot of gardening – we would normally do this – but much more intensely and tidily. For example, the weeding has been so systematic, and, through local wood delivery to us, we’ve made three more raised beds. I’ve taken up more crocheting – fine lace work. So it’s taken me several weeks to complete a table centre, either just as a relaxing activity on dull days while listening to ClassicFM, or while watching TV. I’m not much good with a sewing machine but am learning – I’ve just made a few facemasks and have been intending to take up quilting. Now I’ve finished crocheting and am mastering the sewing machine I intend to start on that. My husband continues with his DIY and gardening projects, much as he has always done – but more focussed on garden improvements. Again, we are lucky in having the equipment and most of the materials to hand without having to buy much in (we are regular buyers online of some materials that one might have to hunt out in local shops). I go for 3-4 mile walks most days – more regularly than normal – but lucky to be able to access footpaths and quiet lanes from the house. I’ve probably watched less TV and more online theatre / Utube videos and listened to music more than normal. Some online webcams – e.g. Dorset Wildlife Trust’s webcam of owl family – have been permanently open tabs – it’s been fascinating watching pair of owls from copulation to egg laying to hatching and feeding young owlets. I’ve been reading a lot as usual – catching up with my stock of books that are on the ‘to-be-read’ pile and downloading just a few new reads on my kindle – no shortage of reading material – mix of fiction and non-fiction. Our personal hygiene routine has not changed at all – though I could really do with a good haircut now. I have been tempted to ask my husband to cut it for me – but I think that’s too risky – I’ll just let it grow and occasionally hack my fringe. He thinks my hair looks alright. Although before lockdown, there were some days when I would not go out, I would always put on make-up. I still put on make-up and dress as I have been doing (though probably using a more limited range of clothes). My sleep patterns have been similar to normal -mostly about 7 ½ hours good sleep. On days when I’ve done little physical activity, I can sleep less well – either taking a long time getting off to sleep or waking up and then being unable to stop those silly, worrying thoughts. This is fairly normal for me and I don’t think there’s been much of an increase in this (if there is a pattern it’s that I tend to have more disturbed sleep the night before I do early supermarket shopping – so still a bit anxious at times). My solution is normally to read a bit more (something unexciting) or occasionally get up and have a milky drink. My husband continues to sleep well as he usually does – and shows no anxiety. 3"

I am a Training Officer working in public transport. Spring 2020 Directive – Covid 19 The world is indeed a very different place to what we are used to in the middle of the Covid 19 pandemic. This directive was written late May / early June 2020 and already in the UK there have been over 41,000 deaths with a daily death toll, which, whilst reducing slightly is still too high to consider reducing precautions. It is extremely concerning for everyone and at the time of writing this I am “shielding” which means that I must stay at home for 12 weeks, only going outdoors for exercise and keeping well away from crowded places. This is because I am asthmatic and therefore susceptible to contracting the virus in a more severe form. This has put added pressure on our household as I have two sons at home who are both classed as keyworkers. They are normally employed in the public transport industry; however, all the local authorities of Greater Manchester are working together to undertake any tasks that are needed. Therefore, they have been involved in activities outside of their usual ones, such as helping to set up the Nightingale Hospital in April and delivering PPE to hospitals across the region. Whilst we are all worried and are taking the utmost precautions, I do not feel that this has affected our mental health as a family. We are lucky in that my husband is fully retired and I work part time and have been able to work from home throughout the crisis. My employers closed our offices on 18th March (whilst I was on holiday) and almost all staff have been working from home consistently from this date. My employers have furloughed some staff with their full agreement, but this has not applied to my role. We have been provided with laptops at home plus any other equipment we need. Office furniture was offered to anyone who doesn’t have such facilities at home to work comfortably (i.e. desks and chairs). Before Covid 19, we had been moving towards laptops and hotdesking so the changes to cope with the crisis were partially in place. We have meetings via Microsoft Teams and have Skype to “chat” to colleagues. It is all working perfectly in the Department we are in and there have already been talks to suggest that we may never revert to all staff being in the office together after the crisis. On a personal level, I am very sociable and already used Facebook, Facetime, What’s App etc to keep up with family and friends, We live in Manchester and all my husband’s family are in Hampshire so we “speak” regularly via these applications and did so long before Covid. My cousin in Oxfordshire is very similar to me and sees the importance of maintaining contact throughout this crisis. She introduced me to Zoom and we have a family chat via this method every fortnight (which is more often than we would normally be in touch!) and this can involve up to seven households. I think this is something which will remain. I have set up other groups with friends and other branches of the family and again we are in touch just as often, if not more, than we would be without the crisis. I want to “learn” Twitter but haven’t done yet, but it is an objective for some spare time during this crisis. We are very lucky in that we don’t have any financial worries and we live in a house with a pleasant garden. We have a large allotment nearby where we can spend a lot of time and we grow a great deal of our own produce. The weather throughout the pandemic has been for the most part glorious and because we have been able to get out without the risk of meeting other people, we have been able to deal with the restrictions more easily than some. My husband has spent a great deal of time at the allotment, we have grown early crops (helped by the weather) that we may not otherwise have done. We have extended our allotment as a person wanted to give up some of theirs, so this has been a great use of time. I have set myself some targets for the time spent in lockdown, taking up writing on a more formal level (including applying to write for Mass Observation!) and pulling together our travel blogs so that we can have them made into photo books. I have a target of learning to crochet as I have never mastered this craft and have wanted to do so for many years. I am also knitting and sewing as we have another grandchild expected in October. Personally, although we have spent more money in Supermarkets as we are buying treats more often, buying a few more bottles of wine to compensate for not going out and buying far more baking ingredients than we would normally, I have not spent anything like the amount of money that I would have spent under normal circumstances. The reason being that we are not going out to lunch with friends, we are not travelling to Hampshire as we usually do on a monthly basis to see our family and grandchildren, we are not eating out as a couple or a family as we would normally. I have therefore used Amazon etc to send “cheer up” gifts to family and friends, sent books to our younger grandchildren and great-nephews. I found some little wooden heart shaped “pocket hugs” on the internet to send to older grandchildren, family and friends that I am missing. I have also sent postcards and written letters when I would normally pick up the phone or send an email but have continued to do that too. My Mum is 88, luckily very local and although my sister has been doing her shopping, I have been baking regularly (almost daily!) and taking something around as a treat. Her grandchildren have bought her jigsaws, been to see her (standing in her garden) and we are taking her the occasional meal. Because we feel that we are abiding by all the rules we have made sure that she gets out walking every day and, on some afternoons, she comes and sits in either my garden or my sisters garden and we have coffee and cake whilst maintaining social distancing. Mum has been very stoical throughout this, not complaining at all, she just wants to get out of the crisis in good health and with all her family intact, she enjoys TV, crosswords, sudoku and anything else that keeps her brain active and she is coping well. Whilst I feel anxious about my sons bringing the virus home and am paranoid about cleanliness in the home, washing their work clothes everyday as soon as they arrive home, including hi-vis jackets which would usually only be washed weekly, I also feel lucky that we can look after ourselves in this way. As I am not attending my workplace I have been in very casual clothes (including, I am afraid to say, Pyjamas on some of the early days!). Personal hygiene has not lapsed in any way as we are a whole household who love a bath rather than a shower, so a bath is now a daily, long, leisurely affair for all of us to kill some time at some point in the day. But other personal routines have lapsed, I can’t get to the hairdresser, so my hair is no longer “styled”, and I have not used my makeup bag for over two months! I am wearing the same clothes on a regular basis, just washing them and wearing again as I am not really going anywhere other than to the allotment and the local park to cycle or walk. My sleep patterns have altered as we all tend to go to bed earlier now than we would in normal times. My sons are probably not asleep but playing computer games with friends or chatting on social media which is a similar situation for my husband and me. We are probably on our phones far more than is healthy, chatting to friends, following the news, reading newspapers, reading books on my Kindle, following Facebook, texting etc. I have “enjoyed” Facebook, there have been interesting posts and challenges, I have been asked by friends to post photos that mean a lot to me either family wise or travel based, and for a bit of fun I was asked to share what influenced my taste in music. I have benefitted enormously from social media use to reduce any stresses that may exist. I have a general interest in history, particularly local and family history and have been researching this. I have posted some findings on Facebook to be seen by family and friends with photos and have had some positive responses which has been lovely. I have spent more time reading, downloading books to my kindle and am definitely watching less TV. The latest book that I have read was “Beyond Peterloo” charting the life of Elijah Dixon a local man who spent his life fighting for the rights of the poor. I have been baking, learning to crochet, knitting, sewing, walking, cycling. I have done some jobs that I have put off for some time (sorting out the loft!) and have a list of tasks still to be done. Decorating is on the list but has not started as the weather has been too good to stay indoors but if this was to change as the lockdown continues then we would start to decorate. I can see amongst my extended family and friends that it is more difficult for some of them. I have other friends and family who are furloughed, and some are on reduced incomes and are not finding it easy. My sister is home schooling her 13-year-old son, who isn’t enjoying being separated from his friends and is often playing up when he is asked to complete his schoolwork in the home environment. Although this sounds trivial, when it is day after day with a moody teenager it does take its toll. My sister’s employer isn’t stepping up to the mark to make working from home a viable option for some of the employees so at the current time she is taking sickness leave as she cannot leave her son for prolonged periods as no schoolwork would get done. Luckily, we live next door to each other, and she can talk to me and talk through any issues and is not as alone as she would otherwise be as a single parent. At the current time I am not aware of anyone who has needed medical or professional help. Covid 19 has widened my experience of friendships and how fragile they can become when faced with opposing opinions and/or mounting stress. I have kept in touch with many colleagues over the years despite our career paths changing. I made a friend in 1976 and have kept in touch at Christmas time and birthdays but since I took flexible retirement, we have seen much more of this couple and enjoyed many days out, lunches, evening meals, weekends away etc. M and his wife are staunch Tories and we are not, and we have previously had light-hearted banter about our respective politics which hasn’t until now affected our relationship. In our eyes (although never voiced) their politics are about “them” and how everything will affect “them”, whereas we see our beliefs to be more widely encompassing and view politics by how it will affect much more than just us. Now in their 70’s they have a nice lifestyle, but do not travel widely anymore because of health issues (diabetes). They have travelled in the past within Europe and once to Australia and New Zealand but never Asia as they “never fancied it”. They remarked when we were going to India on holiday (and about previous holidays we have had in Asia) that they couldn’t go to these countries because of the poor hygiene, spicy food and the violence of the people (??). They tend to believe safety is an issue simply because the people are poor. We have previously brushed off these comments with tales of our thoroughly positive experiences over ten years of Asian travel. However during this crisis our political beliefs being polar opposite brought on a situation that has caused the end of the friendship and I am still reeling with disbelief that in this day and age people can take such exception to the opinions of others. I now have a much greater understanding of how the actions of a few can cause a mutiny and how those few can very easily be ordinary people!. I have been saddened by this (but not to a point where I would want to resurrect a friendship which is clearly past its sell by date). M had been in touch with us during our holiday, via What’s App to say that “he hoped we had arrived OK in India and were safe” but again laboured the point “we wouldn’t have gone” and did we know “there had been a murder in Delhi ” which was 1,700 miles from where we were in Kerala!! We responded that there had probably been several murders in London, but he was, as relatively safe in , as we were in Kerala. Again, light-hearted banter but getting the point across. The next message was “hope you are still OK. Isn’t Boris doing a marvellous job?” a subject matter where he was fully aware that we may have an opposing view. So, I decided to ignore that one, and the next one, and then we came to a decision not to look at What’s App messages and to enjoy the rest of our holiday without the negativity and as we were travelling we really didn’t have the time to enter into pointless banter. I always blog our holidays on Facebook along with photos, for my Mum who loves to know what we are doing each day. Almost daily there were comments from M, not always positive, saying “we wouldn’t have done … ” whatever it was we had done that day or the day before … but always ending, “but we hope you are having a nice time”. Upon our return we scanned the queue of messages in What’s App which were mostly in the same vein about ”how great Boris was doing” and a welcome home one which said “I bet you are so relieved to be back from that place”. I really felt saddened that he didn’t understand the country at all but still felt it was OK to make derogatory comments and so felt I had to respond. My response included what precautions had been present in India, which I knew hadn’t applied in the UK, my opinions of what Boris was doing or more to the point what he had failed to do such as: block large events such as Cheltenham, attend several COBRA meetings, shake hands with people which belittled the severity of the crisis, procure PPE more effectively, provide adequate testing, report honestly on death tolls across care homes etc. I explained that we had felt safer in India and had felt the situation was being dealt with much more proactively there and now back in the UK we felt very anxious and unsafe. I received a response advising that he was “a loyal Tory” (which I think we had guessed!) and “patriotic to his country” and our opinions of “our wonderful country” were “disgusting and foul” and that forthwith he was “blocking us on Facebook” (at this point, my feelings were quite honestly, thank goodness!!). To cap it all, minutes after the blocking, he used the page of a mutual friend to say that he had had to BLOCK (in upper case, to emphasise the matter!) old friends “because of their politics in the current climate” and that they were “disgusting and foul”. I did write one final message and sent via email to advise that we were not disgusting and foul, as he well knew, or we wouldn’t have been friends for so long. I reminded him that we care about the wider community and the world (but managed to refrain from saying that in our eyes he didn’t) and I ended by saying I thought it was a sad to end a friendship because of politics but that we were happy to accept his decision and we wished them both well.  I was infuriated by the suggestion that we are disgusting, thinking this somewhat harsh as we are far from that and he knows as such. When it came into conversation once that we financially support, on a monthly basis, the education of a young girl in Sri Lanka who hopes to become a doctor but couldn’t afford to travel from her village to a place where she would get a better education in the city, he commented that we could have helped a UK cause. I doubt he would ever consider giving to a charitable cause that assists people outside the UK. Overall his comments were completely unfounded and initially it was upsetting to a degree. However, we are now of the opinion that his friendship is not much of a loss to our social lives and we can easily cope without the far right political banter. It has however made me more aware of how sensitive people can be and how they can have an allegiance to people in power that they put above family and friends. I find that bizarre. The Government – I think the political decisions have all been too little, too late and the handling of the pandemic abysmal in the extreme. When the severity of the virus was initially being recognised in early March 2020, we were on a three-week holiday touring Southern India. We had checked the Foreign Office information extensively before we left the UK at the end of February and there was no restriction on travel, so we left and had a wonderful holiday. This was marred only by what we were reading about “back home” and by wondering if we were going to get home easily and what we would be returning home to. We were extremely lucky that throughout our holiday we were getting information from our airline to confirm that our flights remained on schedule (while most around us were receiving cancelled flight information and were having to re-book). In India (the state of Kerala) the preventative measures in place were far superior to those our family and friends were reporting in the UK. We stayed in five hotels and on a houseboat whilst we were there and in every one, on arrival we had to complete a health questionnaire and sit in a Reception area and be observed for two hours before we were allowed to use the facilities and be shown to our rooms. One of our hosts explained afterwards that had we shown any symptoms of being unwell, coughing, temperature, etc we would have been immediately transferred to a quarantine hotel and had to remain there for 14 days. Supermarkets in India are obviously not on the scale of UK ones and are just large “corner shops” but only two people were allowed in at any time and there were washing facilities outside and hand sanitiser and you had to obey the rules. I was so impressed with what they were doing. At the time of writing this twelve weeks later, the UK is STILL not taking any similar actions regarding foreign visitors. Some quarantine measures will be introduced in the next few days but are so airy fairy and difficult to follow up that it is now almost pointless. We flew home from Kerala airport where the army were in charge, army officials took our temperature on arrival before entering the complex, the airport lounges were divided up so that no-one sat within three rows of seating of another person, and it “felt safe”. The army were present to monitor adherence (although I agree that we could have been asymptomatic and fell ill up to two weeks later) but at least they had policies in place, and these were without doubt encouraging sensible behaviour. In the UK press (The Guardian, 14 May 2020) the Indian state of Kerala had had 524 cases and only 4 deaths. The state spans over 15,000 sq. miles and has quite a dense population of 33 million. By comparison the whole of the UK has a population of 66 million and as at the same time the statistics stand at 237,000 cases of infection and 35,000 deaths with an admittance that the death toll is “probably much higher” as there is little clarity surrounding deaths in care homes. Our stopover at Abu Dhabi followed much of the same rules as in India but on reaching the UK there was absolutely nothing in place. We decided not to join the queues (as there no social distancing in place AT ALL) for passport control and sat and waited until the area was clear before going through passport control. I actually asked an immigration officer at Manchester what steps we needed to take now back in the UK and he very clearly told me that I had nothing to worry about and having flown in from India there was no requirement for quarantine. I totally accept that this pandemic would have been a challenge to any Government, and not rating Jeremy Corbyn it would have been an equal challenge to the opposition. Indeed, it has been to Governments across the world. However, the UK has unfortunately witnessed some catastrophic mistakes made by our cabinet led by Boris Johnson. I outlined these above as the high profile events taking place, missing five COBRA meetings, shaking hands, lack of PPE, testing inadequacies and the care homes issue and in my mind a lack of transparency when dealing with Scientists, SAGE, medical professionals and local councils. I think this is not now going unnoticed (thank goodness). Later in the month of May there was the Dominic Cummings fiasco, he ignored lockdown rules and travelled with his family to Durham and whilst stupid more than illegal it set a precedent that rules did not apply to all. I despair and feel a total lack of trust towards Boris Johnson and his Ministers and it is becoming clear that other leaders feel the same way. We are seeing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to follow suit in both the relaxation of lockdown and the decisions around children returning to school. Local Education Authorities in England are now deciding for themselves and not following guidance laid down by the Government. To be fair I also have decided not to follow any Government guidance as what I am doing, in my opinion, is safer than what is proposed. I do think and hope that Keir Starmer would make a much better leader than Boris Johnson and hope that at the next election he will have a chance. I am following the daily afternoon briefings. I have been frustrated by the inability of the speakers to answer some of the questions. I have also been frustrated by the questions that have been asked, many of which have been repetitive and futile. The Government cannot provide a response for every family scenario and there has to be some common sense applied but this has been made all the more difficult by the guidance which has been so open to interpretation and lacked clarity far more than it should have from the very beginning and the media whose behaviour and coverage of the crisis has been utterly dreadful. The news and updates should be open to all and there are subtitles but BSL should also be used to convey the message to those who need it. I cannot see, as this situation continues, that it will become anything other than a political point scoring exercise with compassion and the safety of the nation falling by the wayside. I recognise that the economy is hugely important and needs to start returning to some state of normality. I understand that BREXIT is an all consuming passion for this Government too but it is very clear that they cannot multi task and at the current time everything should be shelved until we have this virus under control and the deaths are minimal. Now is not the time to concentrate efforts on other agendas. I think Government reactions to advice need to be more timely and honest in respect of the virus, the R rate is still not under 1.0, we do not have a robust test, trace and isolate system. Boris Johnson is showing on a daily basis how out of his depth he is in a crisis, he does not have the integrity to hold down such a strategic post. His character is one of laziness, banter and slogans, arrogance, lies and deceit. What the Government needs at a time like this is accountability, integrity, honesty, compassion, credibility and commitment. Boris has none of these characteristics and there are now flaws and breakdowns within his own party when what should be happening is utilisation of the skills of all professionals, regardless of rank and party to address the crisis in which we find ourselves. I am very worried about how this will roll on and what will happen to the nation under such weak leadership, it is unprecedented."

A healthy body­. Feeling at home in the body . Stamina . Easy mobility . Neither under-nor overweight . Managing stress No particular picture in mind as the appearance of a healthy body varies so much with age, however the picture I aspire to is the trim, physically and mentally active older person. Identity Family of origin (parents, one brother) attitudes to diet and leisure activities have been a major influence, outdoor activities and walking for pleasure, preferably with mountains or hills involved, have been something I’ve continued. My parents and older relatives grew up in 1920s, with parents born in Victorian times. One health ideal was to have ‘chubby’ babies (so they would have enough bodyweight to survive a severe infection pre-antibiotics), and they remembered diseases such as rickets associated with poverty. W7502 My family’s attitude was to get on with life and not make a fuss about minor ailments. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing As babies my brother and I were vaccinated for smallpox, as we lived in a port where an outbreak could start.  When I was aged 4 we both had our tonsils removed to prevent constant colds. Around that time my father was seriously ill with pneumonia and was nursed at home, that was my first experience of serious ill health. My mother was clearly frightened, and during my childhood both parents found the illnesses of others frightening, as effective treatments had often not been developed. It was not so much learning about good health as being frightened of the alternative. Both parents smoked, the associated danger to their own health was not well understood and the dangers of exposing small children to secondhand smoke had not been identified. My brother and I both found it so unpleasant that we never tried it ourselves. My mother did explain about periods; she herself had not known about them until she started bleeding. Both parents were conscious of not becoming overweight themselves and not allowing their children to do so, though that was more about appearances than health. School science and cookery lessons combined were thorough in explaining a balanced diet and what the body does with it, calories, etc. A lady from the Family Planning clinic was brought in to do the sex education, but by then I’d read my mother’s ‘The Modern Woman’s Home Doctor’ on the topic anyway (taken from the bookcase when no-one was looking – not given to me to read). Mrs. Beeton was hot on hygiene too, I particularly remember the advice on creeping up to the bed, throwing back the sheets, and slamming down a cake of damp soap to capture the bedbugs, though I’ve never had the opportunity to try out this skill. I also remember Dr. Finlay’s casebook as a source of health information. Key moments W7502 Puberty happened for me well before I was mentally ready for it, needing a bra at age 10, just horrid to be an object of gossip and curiosity to the other girls when changing for gym. And nasty as a very young teenager for my mother to be focused on whether my periods were regular and dragging me off to the doctor when they weren’t. Growing older I took being healthy for granted until in middle age I experienced severe episodes of mental distress. I knew nothing about mental ill health, but looking back now from a more informed perspective I see that my parents were themselves harmed by the trauma and grief of their war experiences, but did not understand it as a health issue. Mental distress in others was always interpreted as bad behaviour. I also saw that prior to the first severe episode I had been experiencing depression without identifying it. Since the time of my own illness I have been very aware of managing stress and avoiding/defusing the situations and triggers that are a risk for me. Various employments have contributed to my knowledge about health, and also to knowing how to find further information. The internet is very useful for this if reliable websites are used. Patient or disease-specific organisations are good sources of detailed information. I have been aware for some years of the changing ratio of working to pension-age adults, meaning that there are now far fewer working age adults to provide healthcare workers for the increasing requirements of older adults, while increasing levels of obesity contribute to the rising incidence of many long-term conditions requiring regular monitoring and treatments. I have become much more careful about my diet and exercise. I have also had some bone damage in my neck which limited what I could do physically, although this is much improved it did take some years. Leaving a sedentary job was a great help. So yes, I am more aware of my body now and I need to maintain this more conscious approach. Anything that decreases mobility is a risk factor for metabolic disorders. Health, wellbeing and appearance W7502 A positive and friendly mental attitude contributes more to physical beauty than clothes and makeup. Being overweight is a visible risk factor for many conditions, and being in pain can make people look years older. A friend died aged 40 from a cancer caused by tattoo ink; although such a cancer is rare it is nevertheless my first thought when I see someone with tattoos. My parents were always conscious of their external appearance, the importance of smart, clean, and appropriate clothing, and particularly clean shoes, although that was more about status than ideals of beauty.  I retain that awareness though I don’t always live up to it. On holidays we left these requirements behind and got happily scruffy and grubby in the countryside. I would have liked to be taller than I am, since I’m not I knew that body shape ideal was unrealistic for me and just got on with making the best of what I’ve got, which makes a hairbrush essential. Getting ready to leave the house My father always wore a suit to work, it was an event when he bought a bowler hat to go with it. My mother made up her face every day, and could not leave the house without doing so. Eventually in her 60s she became so allergic to it that she could not wear it any more, she experienced that as a total disaster even though she looked better and healthier without it – no underlying red blotches showing through the foundation. To go out socialising she dressed up, matching handbag and shoes. She did not like to be seen wearing glasses. In my twenties I used to wear eye makeup and lipstick, but gave up the eye makeup due to allergic reactions, I still wear lipstick. I do like to look smart but rarely go anywhere nowadays where it is appropriate to dress up. Whatever I go out for, the routine can include putting everything needed ready the night before. Over the years it has meant outdoor wear, depending on the weather, any shopping list or other documentation, sometimes food and drink, sometimes a laptop. It now includes hearing aids, which I don’t need to wear in the house and often forget to take with me, and most recently a facemask, plastic gloves, and hand sanitizer. It may mean setting up a satnav in my car, or checking a route, destination, or business by internet before setting out, as I don’t use a smartphone. I am more focused on having everything I need with me than on what I look like – that’s an area of unconscious competence that I don’t think about."

This is a difficult one, isn’t it? I talk about wellbeing a lot in my job, that we need to ‘prioritise our wellbeing’ that the people we support ‘neglect their wellbeing’ that the experiences they face have a ‘significant impact on their wellbeing’. It’s definitely a useful catch all, and it’s helpful that people will view the term how they want to. Are health and wellbeing different? I guess health has more connotations with physical, and wellbeing more connotations with mental in general. But I do think they both encompass both of these. I suppose I would reflect more on mental wellbeing/health than others, given that this has been particularly difficult for me, while I have so far been lucky to be relatively physically healthy. First five words when I think of healthy-fit, slim, energetic, happy, muscular I guess the obvious person right now is Joe Wicks, with all the PE lessons he is doing. He does also promote himself as an all rounder-not only is he healthy physically, he prioritises what he eats and recognises the importance of good mental health. He seems to have a happy home life as well. Identity I think my gender has impacted my experience of health and wellbeing. There is a lot of pressure on women to stay thin, and unhealthy images of women can be promoted-in the past it was extremely thin models, now it’s more to do with women who have had a lot of plastic surgery. As a curvy woman I can be quite self-conscious exercising; I have never had problems at the gym, but do get quite a lot of regular comments when I am running, most of the time I don’t hear them as I have headphones in though. I think being a white, middle class woman, I have been lucky not to be exposed to other pressures. I have never felt my sexual orientation has had an impact on my experience of health and wellbeing. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I was bought up vegetarian so I was aware that we were partly doing that because fruit and vegetables were “healthy”. I knew from a young age that chocolate was a “treat” as I would only occasionally get it in my lunchbox at school. Fitness has always been important to my parents-my dad would regularly run to and from work, which was about 5 miles each way. When I was around 7 years old my parents joined a gym and started going three times a week, we went with them and swam in the pool while they had their gym session. My dad would also take me running. My parents were always responsible for my health and wellbeing, I never considered it and just did what I was told. I think my parents talked to me about the importance of fruit and vegetables as I was a picky eater, and encouraged me to exercise as while my siblings were into sport, I wasn’t. They always took place at home. I don’t remember getting any health education at school (not that it didn’t happen). I never read about it in magazines or spoke to friends. I was very very skinny so wasn’t really worried about my diet or the pressures of losing weight-this only happened later in my life. Key moments I remember my body hair growing, and getting my boobs. I remember going out to get my first bra with my mum, which was very exciting to me. I also remember the pressures of being ‘normal’-starting your period when everyone else did, developing at the same time. I remember being very anxious that I would be flat chested as I was so skinny (something I shouldn’t have worried about as I’m a 34F now!) I was also one of the youngest in my year, being an August birthday, so I was behind in my year and I stressed out about this. I remember being relieved when my period started at 13 and being happy that I wasn’t the last in my friendship group to get my period (second last). We all announced it to our friends when we got it, and were very proud of it, but didn’t discuss it with other classmates, especially not boys or teachers. I think getting your first bra and period are important for girls. You got your first sex education in year six in primary school, where they take the girls off to one side and give them a pack with all the sanitary products we would need. I remember all the girls were very excited about this and comparing what products we had all got-it was like getting presents! Growing older I’ve had to be very active in consciously maintaining my health and wellbeing as I have had mental health issues my whole life and had four breakdowns by the time I was thirty (8, 15, 27 and 30 years old). When I was a child, my parents took responsibility for this, but as an adult I had to take care of myself. Physically I started my life very skinny-when I went to University at 18 years old I weighted 6.5stone. I have always had selective eating disorder and struggled eating vegetables in particular. I started putting weight on when I went to university and could make my own food (all unhealthy!) As my metabolism has slowed down, particularly in my thirties, I have had to become very conscious of what I eat. I now weight 10.5 stone and am on the other end of the spectrum, with my BMI very close to overweight. I have had to educate myself on healthy food and have been very frustrated that I haven’t been able to stop the weight gain. I have become vegan, but that is more for ethical than health reasons. But being vegan you do have to be more creative, especially when you are as picky an eater as I am! I take vitamin supplements-multivits and iron; b12 and omega 3 daily. I am also a lot more conscious about exercising now; currently I try and run three times a week, and do other exercise during the week (normally at the gym, but not during coronavirus). I’m a lot more conscious of my weight now, and I am unhappy about it. Mental health wise I am much better than I used to be-I still have weekly counselling at the minute (which I pay for myself), and have practised mindfulness and done a lot of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I moved out of London after 12 years, and I feel a lot happier now. I also got a dog last year, something I always knew would help my mental health, but I hadn’t been able to do. She is amazing. I try not to get too bogged down in information on health and wellbeing as I could easily get obsessive about it and stressed out. I stick to the basics-healthy balanced diet (5 fruit/veg a day), and plenty of exercise. My friends share a lot of health information with me, but I don’t actively seek it, other than in recipe books. I am more aware of my body now because I am unhappy about my weight. I can feel my thighs rubbing together, I can see my double chin, I can feel my stomach wobble as I run. I’m also more conscious as I’ve got older-I’ve had a persistent knee injury since I was 30, and I can feel my bones creaking when I exercise. I’m in my later thirties now and I’m expecting to panic about getting older-seeing grey hairs, and wrinkles. I think I would put more effort in trying to stay young. I will be interested to see my attitude to plastic surgery and botox as I get older. Right now I wouldn’t do it, but I think that is softening. Health, wellbeing and appearance There is definitely a ‘look’ that is considered healthy, and it is difficult because it’s just not possible for some people to conform to this. I have boobs, and I will always have boobs, so no matter how much weight I lost, I will always look curvy! There are things I like about the body positivity movement that is happening now-we definitely need more images of what healthy looks like. But I think there is a limit-fat is unhealthy, it puts pressure on yourself and on our health service-we need to acknowledge this. People should be happy in their own skin, but if you are fat then you should also be encouraged to make changes. I’ve definitely been influenced by popular ideals, wanting to look a particular way and being frustrated when I can’t obtain it. I’ve never really thought of my parents being influenced by it-my parents have always been thin and healthy, they have worked hard to maintain this, but I don’t think it is to do with beauty but being healthy. I use hardly any health and beauty products. I don’t normally wear makeup, when I do it would be eyelash curlers, mascara, maybe some blusher and lipgloss-never foundation! Occasionally eyeliner/eyeshadow. My moisturising routine is minimal-I use a facewash when I shower, and I put a cleansing gel on each evening, that’s it. Why would I take beauty products to a desert island? No one is going to see me! My Desert Islands item would be my dog! Getting ready to leave the house I vaguely remember my parents getting ready. My mum wears makeup, so she’d put that on and if she was going out for an evening she’d wash and blow dry her hair and put perfume on, but that was it. My dad didn’t do anything other than shower and shave. My mum has dyed her hair since her late thirties, but that is the only way I’ve ever seen her really bothered about physical appearance. My dad grew his hair out and got expensive smaller hearing aids when he lost his hearing, but that’s the only way I’ve ever seen him bothered by it. I get up and dash out so usually just throwing my clothes on, that’s it. If I’m going out I will shower and dry my hair, put some make up on and jewellery but it won’t take long. The routine has not changed over time; other than maybe I wear earrings more often now."

Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Neither of us has experienced physical or mental health issues during lock-down. In fact I would say the opposite has been true and we have felt better. We have both been more active. The only time we have used a car is for a weekly supermarket shop, this is very different to pre lock-down when we sometimes use a car several times a day, we always seemed to be ‘nipping out’ to get something or to visit somewhere. Mentally it has also been a good time, not when I think about the global or national picture with the virus – that is horrific -but as I have felt very protected and able to avoid harm, I have not worried for myself. I have also found the lock-down period quite calming; we are not trying to fit loads in to our day. Previously we would have been meeting up with people or entertaining at home – although these are fun occasions they do come with a certain amount of preparation / travel etc. all of which can create stress. We are lucky in that we have a large house so have plenty of room, we also have a large garden and the weather has been good so we have been outside most days. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? I’ve had some sympathy for the government but some aspects of their management of this crisis have been shambolic. My sympathy lies in the fact that the government and cabinet was pretty new having only being elected back in December, and naively only had one target on their agenda, Brexit. I know scientists and governments do plan for this type of pandemic but this is something that ordinary people had no idea what the impact could be and, neither it seems, did some of those in Government. So many experienced politicians had been axed when Boris Johnson created his style of cabinet after the election. The ones who are in place now seem a bit out of their depth. Initially when the announcement came from Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, about paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers it was an incredible moment. I think the whole country felt a collective sigh of relief that people were going to be helped and everyone went into the lockdown period with more confidence. At the back of my mind though I kept thinking that Rishi Sunak had only been in post for a few weeks and he had only got the job because Savid Javid had resigned. That resignation had been because he had been asked to sack his advisors – which he refused to do. Those in Number 10, we were told, wanted to have more control. Presumably Rishi Sunak agreed to do that. So who is advising Rishi Sunak?? Do they actually know what they are doing? At times this seems like we are sitting on top of a volcano, just waiting ….. I was shocked when we were told that we, as a country, couldn’t source the protective clothing and equipment medical people needed. It was needed in vast amounts of course but I still can’t understand why we were trying to source it from abroad and that factories in Britain weren’t asked to adapt their production lines to make the stuff. The thought of hundreds of people at home sewing up scrubs from old sheets did help a lot of people feel as though they were contributing. Our local Facebook page was full of people asking for unwanted fabric, those offering fabric and details of people who were sewing and how many items they had made. That was a great positive set of posts. But the thoughts of asking doctors, nurses, support workers to work with makeshift stuff, and our medical services needing to rely on someone dragging out their old machine and sitting sewing until late into the night to create protective clothing from someone’s old sheets is something that just makes me shudder. I think in the coming months we will need to face higher taxes. I think there are going to be huge job losses. So many people work in the hospitality industry but much of it, coffee shops and the like, now seems superfluous and I think post lock-down that industry will suffer. I do wonder what employment there will be to replace it. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I have become a regular news addict! Checking the BBC website now happens two or three times a day, I also read the weekend newspapers in detail. We also regularly watch the late night BBC news programme. I did watch the 5pm briefings for the first couple of weeks and also intermittently after that initial period. I thought they were good and very reassuring for the general public. I thought some of the politicians couldn’t answer the questions well enough though, they can talk but I think the journalists should have been able to press home what they had actually asked; too many times they were fobbed off without a clear answer. The medical and scientific people at the ‘5pm briefings’ were good. This is probably because they were giving us the facts and that is what people want to know. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeon’s briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I don’t have any problems accessing the news. Having an interpreter signing is a good idea, it is inclusive. When I have seen Nicola Sturgeon on TV I do listen to her, (she is able to explain her answers clearly) I also find myself watching the interpreter, I find it fascinating how they can communicate such complicated ideas with gestures. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? We have had it easy. Our income has not been affected and none of my children have been furloughed so I am not worried about that. Neither have we been involved with home schooling so, as I said, we really have had it easy. My partner and I are generally very happy together and really have enjoyed many of the days during lock-down. It has at times felt like a holiday; friends who are in a similar position have said the same thing. Just being together, all day, has made me realise a difficulty though. I have noticed that if we have disagreed over something we have had nothing to distract us from the problem. Before lock-down we would have carried on with everything else we were doing and whatever the problem was would have started to feel less significant. Now though, the problem stays ‘in the air’ -we still carry on speaking to each other – but about other things – not the problem. I have found that I have to shelve the issue for the time being. If I have an idea my partner always initially thinks of why things shouldn’t happen. It takes time for us to reach a place where we are both happy with the decision. This has always been the case but now I do feel I let things go, just to keep the peace. It is, at times, draining. Emotionally I have found that I have felt a little suppressed at times. I keep quiet, to keep the peace. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I have used Zoom for the first time and we have had regular, pre-arranged meetings with two sets of friends and one of our children. With one set of friends we have made a weekly date to Zoom in the morning. We used to meet these people for coffee, now we all have a break from what we are doing, make a coffee and then Zoom. One of the six of us is in the early stages of dementia and this is really noticeable over Zoom as, unless one of us says her name -or asks what she thinks, I can see that she can no longer chip-in to a conversation. It has made me realise how difficult for her partner it must be at home because she never instigates a conversation, only responding to others, even then she often asks her partner for the answer. This was not noticeable when we met outside our houses as there was always the environment or the other people in the coffee shops to talk about. With another set of friends we Zoom over a gin and tonic each week, in the early evening. These are people we would have met probably 3 or 4 times a year, mostly at sports related events. Here the conversation flows much more freely – maybe that’s the gin! It is definitely a more light hearted Zoom meeting. With both meetings we are talking to the groups much more frequently than we would have done normally. Before we Zoom, I do make a mental list of things to ask about as with one of the groups the conversation can dry up. We have also used WhatsApp a lot more. This has been mainly used for sending on jokes, or video clips -some of which are very funny. When all this started there was an enormous creation of jokes etc which were doing the rounds on the internet or by phone. It felt as though it was a bit of a race to be the one to send something on to friends before other people did. I suppose it was a bit of a reaction to being indoors all day and knowing everyone else was in the same situation. At the beginning of the lock-down I feel my partner became a bit too enthusiastic about sending these on to people. Similarly, I noticed that he had to look at his phone the minute a new message came in, even during a meal, and would be quickly scrolling through his contacts deciding who to send it on to. He was made to think about this when a friend sent him a message which asked: ‘Are you too being harassed by people sending messages which may not be always welcome?’ and went onto give some tips what to do about it. The message was very polite -but pointed. I think my partner realised then that maybe this was a subtle way of telling him that our friend was fed up with receiving these messages several times a day. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? I have changed my shopping habits and I now shop once a week, at a supermarket. It has been much easier to plan meals as we have had no last-minute invitations to go out nor have we suddenly decided to go somewhere and eat out. Both of these situations happened frequently before. I now know what is in the freezer and am much more organised. I have tried new recipes. Some of that is because we are now harvesting vegetables we have grown but also because I have had more time to think about food preparation. Friends have also used WhatsApp to send recipes they have tried and want to recommend. We have not eaten any ready meals or take away food at all during lock-down. Our last meal out was several days before lockdown started when we met with some of my partner’s cousins who live in Surrey. As we were the visitors, we left it up to them to choose the venue. It was a nice pub near Cobham, quite trendy. Apart from us, there was just one other couple there and they argued throughout their meal, awful for them as neither of them was enjoying the occasion but quite interesting for us! The cousins couldn’t understand what the place wasn’t busy; they had booked ahead and had been quite pleased that there was a table available as normally this isn’t always possible. They couldn’t believe that people were obviously already taking heed of the advice that was being issued in other countries but not yet in Britain (the date was Wednesday 11th March), the barman said it was really obvious to them that people were stopping going out. On top of this the bill, for the six of us, came to a whopping £230! We have been saving lot money during lockdown. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. We have had no trouble entertaining ourselves, the days have whizzed by. Initially we started on a big sort out and clean of the house but my partner’s interest in this soon waned. He has though gone on to clear large parts of the garden. I have walked more and was for several weeks going out daily choosing a different walk each day. I’ve walked onto the common, along the river, through housing estates, discovering some footpaths for the first time! There were some lovely moments. I was walking down a normally busy thorough fare in our small town; it was deserted. On the ground someone had used chalk to create a lovely arty design, alongside it was written the caption ‘Just listen to the birds’ – it was true they sounded wonderful, normally they probably wouldn’t have been in that part of town or if they were the street noise would have drowned their song. I’ve also researched a family history for a friend, and written all the evidence up. I am really pleased with the result. As I had the time I became much more creative with how I presented the information and have learnt all sorts of new skills on the computer. I’ve also started some sewing, something I have wanted to do for ages. I printed the pattern at home, it was provided free on the website of the ‘Sewing Bee’, a TV programme. I didn’t know this existed before lockdown. I’m making a little dress, it has smocking on it and looks similar to the ones Prince William’s daughter often wears on family occasions. I don’t yet know who I will give the dress to but am happy to be using it as a practice piece. It is so long since I have done any sewing that I have had to remind myself what my sewing machine can do. I’ve been looking on YouTube for short little clips to remind me how to do things. Yesterday I learnt how to make a ‘rouleux loop’ – something new to me! We have watched very little television. We caught up on a couple of films that were available on Amazon early on in the lock-down and the news bulletins but that’s about it. As we have had such warm evening for much of the lockdown period we have often listened to music in the evenings, sitting with the French doors open enjoying watching the night sky. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I have hated the fact that my partner feels he doesn’t have to shave! I wouldn’t mind a beard but the scruffy two days growth makes him look really old. He did however trim the hair on his head himself. We both still showered everyday and wore clean clothes. We have though been regularly in quite relaxed clothing, shorts & tee-shirts. This must be the longest time ever, since I had my first ever job at the age of 16, that I have not bought any new clothes! There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. My sleep and that of my partner has been good. I think going to bed without having to set an alarm because we plan to be out and busy the following day has really helped me to sleep more soundly. We live on a busy road and there have been a huge reduction in the amount of traffic and the reduction its noise, was so noticeable. These two aspects combined have led to me having a much more restful night’s sleep. I usually dream a lot, usually my dreams are quite realistic and I can remember a lot of detail. During lockdown I may still be dreaming but I don’t remember them."

In other words, wellbeing imputes a kind of nurturing of self, that ‘health’, which is a statement, doesn’t.  It’s an emotional description of a state of mind. ‘A healthy body’: lungs, heart, pain, eyes, functioning. An anonymous athlete comes to mind – maybe somebody throwing the discus. I have no idea why. Identity I’m white, female, middle class and was born just after WWII.    I suppose class defines how I see myself to some degree (although I’m ashamed to say so), so that I think being obese or even grossly overweight is something I would never let myself be, although I am overweight. On reflection I’m not sure whether that’s a class thing, or vanity or whether its because I know how bad for the body it is and in fact I don’t think my health has been in anyways influenced by my perception of my own identity, real or imagined. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing Now, young people are FAR more aware of their own personal health and wellbeing than I ever was as a child or a teenager or even going into my twenties. My parents smoked and I smoked when I went to university in 1964.     I never nagged my parents about smoking, but my own children nagged me and my husband about smoking … that was in the 1980s.  I also used to drink quite a lot. My father played tennis quite regularly and placed a lot of store on the importance of being well … I remember ‘mens sana, corpora sanis’ …. But I can’t remember my mother ever doing much physically at all. I suppose the importance of looking after oneself physically gradually dawned on me, there was certainly no light bulb moment and I’m quite lazy by nature so that I didn’t enjoy games or physical exercise and it never occurred to me that there might be a good reason to keep the body as well as it could be.  I took it all for granted. Key moments My mother explained puberty and as far as I can remember everything went pretty smoothly however she introduced me to sanitary towels and they were ghastly. I was immensely relieved when I started wearing tampons.   I used to have a heavy period which could be embarrassing because occasionally blood leaked when it shouldn’t have but it was never that debilitating. I think my primary feeling about puberty – and all its aspects – was embarrassment. I was embarrassed at becoming interested in boys. P7552 Growing older My attitude to health has changed completely.  As I said, I used to take my wellbeing for granted. At one stage we had an exercise bicycle, but I think I stopped going on that very quickly. Through most of my life I have had a quasi battle with my weight and have yo-yoed in a characteristically unhealthy way.   I gave up smoking in my late ‘40s.  At the same time, I became more and more conscious of my own lack of exercise so that I gradually started to do more physically I certainly don’t take my health for granted now and I am much more aware of my all round wellbeing …. and of my body in a completely different way. I am very aware of being 74 and of trying to stay as fit as I can for as long as I can. I started going to a gym when we came back from living in Rome in the year 2000 but quickly realised how very boring it was as well as being incredibly time consuming, so I bought a treadmill. Eventually I got rid of that and bought a rowing machine, but I have a bad shoulder so rowing became painful. What I have now is a cross trainer on which I go six mornings a week for about 25 minutes to half an hour. It is part of my getting up routine and I think to a very large degree has kept me as well and as fit as I am. I certainly have more stamina than most of my contemporary friends. I no longer see my weight as a cosmetic issue, more as a health issue and that has enabled not to panic over it eg I am still overweight, but I’m aware of eating healthily (most of the time). Arthritis is a problem for a lot of people of my age and very occasionally I have a bad back or an aching hip, but at the moment that seems to go away if I just rain back on sweet things (I’m a chocoholic) and stretch my bady. I have cut down on drink a lot so that now – although occasionally I drink a lot – its no longer a regular think. Of course I will continue exercising and eating healthily for as long as I can. Health, wellbeing and appearance I have always regarded myself as looking quite run of the mill.  I’ve never been tall or thin or elegant or blond. I’ve been OK, but I think I probably always had a disparaging attitude to my own physical appearance.  I think my parents introduced me to ideas of low physical esteem – my father used to call me monkey and I can remember my mother admiring the figure of a friend of mine … she never admired my figure. Comparing myself to others always found me wanting. My husband said that I was beautiful but I dismissed that saying something like “you would say that wouldn’t you” !!!! (he wasn’t my parent after all, he didn’t have to say that). Now, I find it quite a relief in a way – my contemporaries and I are none of us conventionally beautiful and if we’re interesting and that shows in our faces, well that’s completely different. I’m very lucky because I haven’t gone grey yet, therefore I can still have some vanity about elements of the way I look which is ok because I feel its based on reality – and I don’t have to compare myself to magazines and find fault. I couldn’t do without some kind of moisturiser and I would need to take an eyebrow pencil to a Desert Island! In terms of ritual, after my exercise and my shower I dry my hair (I wash my hair every day), dress and put on my make up.  I do that every day, whether I’m going out or not. When I go out, I just make sure that my face isn’t shiny but I don’t do anything special. This has always been my routine (without the exercise … see above.)"

Fed up, frustrated and slightly concerned by loss of income as have my own small business and am not eligible for any government support. The Government Initially quite impressed by the overall handling – in particular the Job Retention Scheme which my daughter (E) has been able to benefit from.  Much less so now as they seem to have no idea as to how to get out of the situation and I now feel that we are being ‘fobbed off’.  Feelings became more negative with the Stay Alert etc. message.  Also feel we cannot live indefinitely in limbo land. Re steps.  Heaven knows, -they don’t seem to have a clue! News Brief look at BBC online, The Guardian (online) , The Week (print) No longer re 5 pm broadcasts. Fed up with them as they seem to go nowhere. No re access – thought that BSL was used in some of the briefings – am sure that the ones I saw were signed? Work and Home Life As I am currently busy writing a book (MS due 30th October) I have been using the time to try to get as far ahead with this as I can and maybe finish early … Wishful thinking perhaps.  However, I cannot get access to all the archives I would have liked to use so in some ways the book may be slightly different to the one I anticipated writing. In terms of my small business – this is completely on hold as I work with HE students who are now all at home and my work (dyslexia assessment) cannot be done remotely.  This is a slight financial worry but not too huge as the 2nd semester is always quieter than the first. Lockdown – seen a little more of my husband but only really in that we are tending to go for walks together and eat lunch together whereas in the past I have not always been around.  Occasionally we can be irritable with each other but maybe not more so than normally or other couples who have been married for nearly 45 years! Technology Used Facetime a little more to speak to my sister in Switzerland and elder daughter (R) who should be in Singapore but is stuck in Australia due to having gone there on holiday just before Singapore closed its borders only allowing SIngaporeans to return and R, her husband (J) and baby (T) are only on Work Permits. Have used Facebook occasionally – loathe it but to see what some friends are up to and have used Twitter a bit to try to keep my profile visible.  Dislike both of them! Would never trust news from these sources! Shopping Nothing has really changed.  Have put on a little bit of weight but more to do with exercising less than eating more! Have not shopped for food online – husband does most of the food shopping anyway. Entertainment and Leisure No time for these really due to pressure of writing the next book! However, have tried to watch either a recorded ballet performance or one episode of a serial with my younger daughter E (who lives in the same block of flats and is on her own with a 2.5 year old) once a week just to break the evening up for her – although she speaks a lot to friends via FT in the evenings. Reading a lot of Dorothy Sayers currently Would love to have time for my embroidery or a jig-saw but cannot indulge.  Have plans to do these when the (wretched!) book is finished Personal Hygiene I would LOVE a haircut and to have my highlights done! A very long-standing hairdresser friend (F) does my hair normally and as we don’t see much of each other this is a fun social event. Am going to ask her when she feels that she might be able to come over and do it but she is a stickler for rules so might not want to. I am therefore becoming greyer and bushier by the day. Showering more at home now as not going regularly to the gym as I sued to shower there. No strong feelings either way about this. Sleep I’m a very bad sleeper anyway but this has not been affected by Covid.  At the beginning had more vivid dreams but these seem to have tailored off. I do take a sleeping pill sometimes but try not to make this more than once a week due to fear of becoming addicted. Have a GP friend who is very anti them and so her feelings have rubbed off on me. Husband (I) is waking up even earlier than usual – 6 am is a lie-in for us and says he has had very vivid dreams but cannot remember them when he wakes up properly."

I suffer with anxiety and am autistic, so routine is very important to me. I live with my 87 year old mother who has Parkinson’s Disease. At the start of lockdown, she was experiencing severe sciatica pains making walking or bending impossible. She had to speak to her GP on the phone and he made a home visit to see her. She was prescribed strong painkillers and arranged for social services to assess her and get the house adapted so she gets around it easier. We heard from them within days and someone visited to fit a frame around the toilet and brought her a zimmer frame. A few days later another worker came and fixed a rail at the top of the stairs, raise the bed height and armchair. As lockdown progressed her sciatica pains eased somewhat but she, being 87, remained at home and had various other health issues such as leg swelling and mobility problems. For me this has increased my anxiety about her and my fears of losing her. I think the government should have taken action sooner looking back now.  It was reported just the other day that if we had gone into lockdown a week earlier, we could have halved the number of UK Covid19 deaths. It is easy to blame Boris Johnson and the government for everything though and I feel he has been criticized negatively for every decision made throughout. It’s a very challenging and unknown situation for everyone. I think in the coming months, as long as there isn’t a second wave of the virus (please no!) other sectors of the community and economy will restart.  The problem area seems to be schools. I don’t have children, but I think the government needs to address this more forcefully as soon as possible. Another area of concern is hospitality and entertainment, theatres, cinemas, etc. News I have accessed news throughout the pandemic via TV, radio. Internet (and social media) and sometimes newspapers. In the early stages of lockdown, I did watch the daily government press broadcasts for the latest information. As it progressed though I only bothered when it was going to be a significant announcement.  I also watched the Queen’s historic broadcast and was keen to hear news of the prime minister’s C7593 health when he was seriously ill with the virus. I myself have not had problems accessing the news. I noticed BSL interpreters with Nicola Sturgeon on her broadcasts but not for England’s briefings for some reason. If I was in need of this, I would have been angry that it was not added. Work and Home Life Due to my health issues, I do not work. I volunteer in a shop and obviously non essential shops have been closed. So, for me, although it has not impacted on me financially, it has affected me in other ways. Routine is very important to me so having to stay in with no particular structure week after week has taken a lot of adjusting. I live with my 87 year old mother – no worry of home schooling thank goodness. She is quite frail, so I’ve become more of a carer to her in lockdown. I do worry a lot about her, so I’ve been checking on her a lot being indoors with her. Technology I have always considered myself quite bad with technology and my mum has never used a computer, doesn’t want to, and will not even have a mobile phone.  I have an iPhone 11, an iPad and laptop (Mac). During lockdown I have learnt how to do Zoom and done many art related courses through it. I had never even heard of it prior to lockdown. I use Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. I have been glad to have these resources at this time and have pushed myself to try things via technology which I would not have bothered with otherwise. Shopping and Food During lockdown I have made a physical trip to the supermarket every week.  Buying online was a nightmare especially at the start of lockdown with people unable to get a delivery slot for weeks. So, I went to Asda for our food every week. The first time I went within lockdown was quite an eye opener. I arrived and realised there was a queue to enter the store all around the car park. I hesitated wondering whether to leave it and go back home but realised C7593 there was no choice, this was how it is now. We all stood in the queue 2 metres apart with our trolleys at the ready. Once inside the store it was better than usual as there wasn’t too many people inside.  I just got my items, face mask and gloves on then paid. I remember everyone being very wary of each other and it felt quite hostile and unfriendly. It was quiet with no music playing, just announcements about the rules and keeping safe. My eating and cooking habits haven’t really changed that much in lockdown. I’ve eaten more pasta though. Entertainment and Leisure During lockdown I decided to try and focus on my art/creativity.  At first I felt a bit down and lacking motivation. It was early Spring, so I took some photos on my walks in the nearby park capturing unusual shots of the nature around. I wanted to try to document this time somehow. I then started some Zoom sessions and did a creative writing course based around writing in isolation. I had been going to paint my bedroom but have not got around to it. With the weather being so sunny and warm I have been glad we have got a garden and have used it a lot more. I always have a notebook on the go and use it to note art ideas, ‘to do lists’ and thoughts/plans. I have been enjoying watching my usual programmes notably Eastenders. But I’ve found some TV incredibly boring such as repeats of ancient football matches, cookery shows, property hunt type programmes and the awful ‘Come dine with me’ which my mum enjoys. I have been watching old episodes of ‘Top of the Pops’ from 1989 on iPlayer which has made me feel quite nostalgic as a lot happened in my life then. I listen to music on Spotify including 80s/90s music notably dance music and some current chart music. Personal Hygiene I feel I’ve stuck to my usual personal hygiene habits quite well in lockdown. I’ve not been so bothered about wearing different outfits all the time as no one has seen me.  Also, my hair is usually highlighted every 6 weeks at the salon, so my hair roots are showing a lot. I usually wear mascara every day, but I haven’t been bothering to put that on. I like my routine so I’ve still been trying to stick to it through lockdown with the things I can such as getting up/dressed, eating times, etc. This has helped me with some sense of normality. C7593 Sleep At the start of lockdown my sleep was a bit disturbed but then I got back to sleeping quite well. I have got into the habit of having naps during the day too as I seem to have felt very tired. I have experienced many many strange dreams in lockdown. Some have been re occurring dreams which I get quite a lot of.  One theme in these is a hotel type building and a fear of going up the stairs to the upper floors. There is a feeling of danger and fear surrounding the upper floors. I don’t know what this signifies. I have also had bizarre one off dreams. In one, I was going on a ‘day trip’ to Venezuela for some sort of festival. I do not travel and have never thought about this country, so I don’t know where this came from. I often tell my mum about my dreams when they are strange. One day she said, ‘it must be like going to the theatre every night’. Yes, they can be quite entertaining."

Female, age 59, married . Kingsdon, Somerset . Former public sector middle manager, and historical photo web platform founder Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? I loathe the phrase ‘health and wellbeing’ two words that when joined together bring to mind (for me) an entire industry of lip-service and buck-passing by employers, business and government. I hope that eventually it will lead to better working conditions and genuine interest in individuals, but so far, I see it as a label that is symptomatic of doing less, but making far more noise about it. For example, my former large employer made their well-respected and experienced welfare officer redundant and replaced them with a phone line to some random company. Nobody wanted to talk to strangers so some staff took courses in counselling off their own bat and offered support to colleagues in their own time. Spotting that, the company then promoted their activities as a new wellbeing initiative. I think the limit of their interest was for Human Resources staff to take it in turns to sit on a sofa under a banner saying ‘let’s talk’ during mental health week. As that was in public, in the canteen, no one wanted to be seen to join them on the sofa. But still, they ticked a wellbeing box and they had a nice photo for the recruitment literature. The same employer used to regularly offer workplace health checks for blood pressure, weight, cholesterol etc which sometimes resulted in individuals being referred on to their doctor. Those have ceased too and been replaced with a (compulsory download) company ‘Lifeworks’ App that just reminds us to get these checks done regularly via the NHS. When staff are sick the manager now rings to check on their wellbeing. That sounds nice, but it generally isn’t. The few wellbeing calls I had would start off with ‘how are you’ (concerned voice), but move on to (disappointed voice) that I was not picking up emails. And then move on again to engage me in conversation about various work projects. I was left feeling sufficiently guilty to log in and look after ‘just the urgent’ things while I was really very unwell. The other thing they did during Covid team online meetings was to start off by asking each person how they felt. Obviously, everyone just said ‘fine’, because who is going to tell 10 people on a Zoom call that they are not OK. So, my experience of the rise of ‘Health and Wellbeing’ at work has not been positive. Health and Wellbeing also crops up with regularity in my social feed and in advertising. There seems to be no end of apps promising that they will dramatically improve my health and well-being, either through online exercise routines (first few sessions free) or to help me manage my mental health in various original ways (in-app purchases).  The key word in these seems to be ‘You’ and what ‘you’ can do to improve your own health and wellbeing. It all feels a bit like ‘go cure yourself’ which if it doesn’t work for physicians is not going to work for the general public. The advice given before is often extremely patronising (tips for a good night’s sleep anyone?). They are also (despite using a lot of words like ‘quick’ and ‘five minute’) surprisingly time-consuming. Having invested effort following the self-help path recommended it leaves you to feel a bit of a failure if the problems still remain. I have tried a few, including some quite original ones that I thought looked interesting (NHS audio tracks for a positive mindset) but now I can’t be bothered with them because they suck a lot of time out of the day and just serve to keep you focused inwards when being outward looking might be a bit more helpful. What would actually help is what wealthy people get i.e. quick access to a professional diagnosis and appropriate expert advice to get their health and well-being back on track. Because in many cases the dire effect on someone’s wellbeing is simply that, for example, they are hard up and can’t sleep for worry about how to pay the mortgage, rent or credit card bill. The biggest improvements for the largest number of people nationally would be schemes to help people avoid debt, or get out of debt. Being very hard up is OK for a short while, but it eats away at you the longer it goes on and induces feelings of constant low-level panic, helplessness and defeat. It makes people depressed because they can’t solve it and feel they must be at fault. Sometimes they maybe partially to blame, but everyone who has been poor for a long time will identify with the need, not just for survival, but to have some joy in your life that, for example having an unaffordable holiday will bring. When someone is a carer everyone acknowledges they need a break from the relentlessness of their day – well feeling perennially poor is something people also sometimes need a break from and they need this to help their wellbeing more than any medication or advice. I sometimes wonder if all the money spent on health and well-being was just given to people instead whether that would give a more positive response. After all a surprise £20 in the post would a rather nice present that would cheer people up no end. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Fit, young, slim, perfect, intelligent Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. A 20 something young woman in peak of physical fitness. For some reason the image I see also has long glossy hair, but it does not look like they wear (or need to wear) any make up. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Gender has only been an influence when seeking contraceptive and ante-natal services.  Notice I say ante-natal as my experience was that once the baby arrived all interest was lost in my own health, the focus being entirely on the new little one. A bit dispiriting as you just feel like an empty shell that has served its purpose and is no longer worth anyone paying attention to. I hope that’s improved in the 25 years since my last baby. I don’t think social class has had an impact on my health and wellbeing, the main connection with health and social class is linked with money and ability to pay for better care not with social class. The upper-class poor (I suppose there are some) experience of health would probably be the same as mine. Similarly, the experience of newly rich working-class people will be to afford much better care. That can seem a revelation if they have only used the NHS until they were better off. For example, for a few years we could not get an NHS dentist at all. None to be had. We went private as there was no choice. At the first appointment the dentist talked about ‘having a long-term plan to improving the presentation of my teeth’ What! In my experience dentists simply looked to solve any problems with decay, not to actually make teeth look better than before. Plus, it was all very relaxed and the receptionists were very smiley and nothing was too much trouble. My NHS dentist had photos of the inside of children’s mouths with terrible decay to look at while you waited on ancient chairs in a corridor. The private one was all plus sofa’s with art on the wall and glossy magazines. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? My mother had lots of books about health (or rather illness – you looked things up if you were feeling unwell not otherwise) plus books on childcare. They were hidden away, but we read them from cover to cover anyway as we had already read everything else in the house. There did not seem to be any focus on ‘wellbeing’. If you were well there was no problem was there!  I was aware of books like ‘How to make friends and influence people’ but the main focus on what people might term well-being now was in articles in women’s magazines. Along with the recipes, creative projects, child care advice and house hold tips there were always features about health and wellbeing.  Some of them had scissor markings to show how they could be cut out before your children might get hold of the magazine.  Mum always did that immediately, much to our disappointment. Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Mainly my mother, but also the school nurse and local doctor Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? I remember being taken out into the back garden for a talk by my mother (with a book) after I had insisted to my older sister that babies came out of your bellybutton (well what else could it be for?). I think we went into the garden to get away from other members of the family. Also, I remember being very embarrassed when I had a strange thing happen to my toe. I was very afraid and thought I might be dying, but the rest of the family laughed. (I had never seen a blister before). Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? School was a big source of health information. Vaccinations at school happened regularly and at secondary school there were talks on drugs, smoking, alcohol and so on. At junior schools we had people come in and tell us how to clean our teeth and of course there was the school nurse. Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? I was very thin so a later developer and it seemed that all my friends were going through puberty before me.  Bras were a problem as you have that stage where breasts are showing but a bra is not needed and I just went very round-shouldered trying to hide what was happening. Then I realised I was going to be flat-chested whatever. My solution was to grow my hair to cover my breasts; it took ages. Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? First period for a girl is life-changing. For my own daughter I wanted it to be a more positive experience than mine so at the first weekend of her period I took her out and bought her new undies, some beauty things like tweezers and a mirror, a little bag to hide her pads in for school and hair accessories, as well as a supply of different sorts of pads to try.  We also talked about how to manage a sudden period and tried to answer her questions. But mainly to try and make it a bit of a celebration of womanhood. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I vividly remember my first period. It was a lot more painful and messy than expected, but with an older sister it was not a surprise. I just thought it was so unfair girls had to have them.  My mother must have had lighter ones as she never bought me enough pads and I felt it was my fault that I kept running out. A period always seemed shrouded in a sense of shame. Our pads were burnt on the fire (when the men were not around) or put in the dustbin in the summer (wrapped in newspaper and hidden under other things). I was given second-hand teen bras from my sister, One with pink flowers and one blue. Hated them. I had no further help from my mum about buying bras or transitioning into an adult. It was not deliberate, but just assumed I would ask if there was a problem, which I never felt I could do. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I was never sport as I was so lanky and clumsy and I even failed to learn to swim during school lessons. In the end I taught myself breast stroke by going to the pool in the evenings once I was working and always enjoy a swim. At times I would go weekly but we now live quite a long way from a public pool which seemed very run down and grubby when I tried it. Also, public pools are so busy. I do walk and try to do steps, but that is a bit depressing as the recommended 10,000 steps takes at least an hour and a half. So, unless your job involves walking how is anyone supposed to fit that in everyday? I have only done it a few times when I was on my feet all day. I liked Tai Chi but the classes have now moved to another venue. I was all set to join them again until Covid. I have a couple of health conditions that do make exercise important. One is osteoporosis and the other is pelvic prolapse. I have just had an operation for the latter and am doing daily physio for core body strength, but will never be able to do some movements in keep fit without risk of a recurrence. I have developed my own daily routine that takes about 10 minutes mixing some Tai Chi moves with weights I can safely handle for upper body. I also do lower leg and ankle strengthening exercise every day following a broken ankle. Plus, a 20-minute fresh air walk. So, in short, I do what I can in a self-directed way and am looking forward to re-joining a class. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Dr Internet provides me with most of what I want to know, although I am very happy to hear from experts in person and wish there was someone, I saw on a regular basis so that it would be easier to ask about doubts and worries. My ideal set-up would be to have an annual contact with someone who would say ‘Is there anything else at all that’s bothering you?’ and has 10 minutes to spare to give what I say attention. Often people have little health worries that do need a professional eye, but seem too small to bother a doctor with for an appointment.  For example, my experience of asking a doctor to look at a mole was first a totally dismissive (more or less ‘stop wasting my time’) but at second attempt with another doctor he got out his magnifying glass and had a close look. He said it was a type that should be monitored (I knew that from reading health advice) so measured it and recorded that with strict instructions to come back if it changed so that it would be compared with the baseline just taken. Online I read the academic papers and journals if I can get access and one or two reputable websites. That includes the NHS and hospital information leaflets online, but they tend to be a bit general. Once I have a diagnosis, I refer to the NICE pathways which are useful so that you can understand what might happen next and also what the doctor is on about. Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? About the same awareness now as always, but there is more information to read now. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? My parents seemed to be continually on a medical pathway of some sort once they were retired. Their entire lives revolved around appointments for doctor, hospital and medical related services.  I would like to avoid that for as long as possible because nothing seemed joined up and they never seemed to get signed off from anything, just to gather more appointments for various clinics. I have not thought about how my own approach to health and wellbeing might change in the future, but I would like to avoid that over-medically managed type of life. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to appearance, but are not the only factors. I know some very unwell people and some who deal with terrifying mental health issues that take them to the brink of a breakdown but who look really together. They take great care to mask their issues by paying careful attention to their appearance. Other people may be perfectly well, but don’t prioritise putting effort into their appearance.  It does take effort to be well-groomed, neat and tidy and an ill person will find it harder.  However, making that effort can actually make you feel better too, there is a symbiotic relationship. Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? We are all influenced by the popular ideals of beauty and physical appearance (even should we scorn that we are). Even the most unfashionable person looking back at photos of themselves will see that they still look like they belonged to that era through hairstyles and clothing, not least because you can only buy what is in the shops and fashionable colours and styles come and go.  We are now in the mustard colour and eyebrows era. I’ve never wanted to look like one particular person, but definitely mourned my misfortune of not having the ‘bee-stung’ lips that were so idealised when I was younger. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? They tried to be reasonably fashionable, but clothes were bought on the basis they would last and be practical, they would never buy shoddy to get a quick win for appearance sake. They would aim for smart rather than fashionable in a popular way. When Mum wanted to be more adventurous, she would make clothes herself and was constantly doing so. As children we had some quite ‘out­there’ clothes she had made as it was cheap to do for children who needed far less material, especially in an era of short skirts. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? My desert island item would be Vaseline, to use for lips but any other dry skin too. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Dad was away in the navy so I didn’t used to see him getting ready. Mum didn’t work while we were small. Getting ready to go out together was a rare occasion. We did not see them get ready but Mum would be preceded down the stairs by gorgeous orange smelling Aqua Manda perfume. Dad of course was ready first and waiting in the hall. What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? When young and up to even late twenties I would sometimes try on several things before settling on what to wear even for work that day. I was short of money for clothes and simply never had enough so problem I had was trying to make the same clothes look a bit different by swapping tops and skirts about or adding a jacket. I would raid summer clothes for winter by adding thick petticoat and tights and jacket, or swelter in a winter skirt with a summer top. I can quite understand the attraction of Primark for really cheap clothes nowadays, for young people on limited means they offer up to the minute fashion for not a lot. Clothes were much more expensive when I was young, you can buy a skirt now for less than I had to pay when I earned a 10th of my present income. Hair used to take ages too as I used curling tongs to get a flick in my longish hair or would put it up according to what the fashion was.  I always used to wear mascara and didn’t feel dressed without it. It gave me no problem even though formulas were less good then. But suddenly I found I could not wear it at all without it irritating my eyes and after buying lots of different ones I had to give it up. Eyelash tongs were then my thing but at crack of dawn got more and more tiresome to do and they now languish in the drawer. Now I have a wardrobe built up over the years there are pieces I can pull out from long ago that are now back in fashion, or never went out, or I will buy for an occasion. Plus, fashion is less restrictive. Once if your skirt was the wrong length you stuck out like a sore thumb, now hemlines can be of any length and wearing something vintage is like virtue signalling your green credentials.  I no longer spend much time on my (short) hair. Moving to a rural area has also made a difference. People in the market town don’t dress up to go shopping like we did in our previous urban area.  It would not be unusual to see someone in wellies. Around the village it would be laughable to wear anything else apart from trainers, low heel boots or wellies or sensible sturdy sandals in the summer. Teetering along the lane in heels just looks hilarious, and marks out townies down for the weekend. Preparation for going out into the village takes almost no time (put on footwear, grab a coat), shopping locally takes little more time. Work prep takes more time. Going to London feels like another country and if you don’t want to look like a country mouse it takes much more work. Covid has changed us in terms of make-up (no point in lipstick) and jewellery.  Wearing earrings is a nuisance with having to loop a mask around your ears and rings are equally annoying when you have to keep sanitising your hands.  Before Covid I would never go out without earrings, didn’t feel dressed otherwise and my engagement ring never left my hand. Presently all my jewellery is just going dull from misuse."

Female, age 59, married . Kingsdon, Somerset . Former public sector middle manager, and historical photo web platform founder Health Covid19 has impacted my health because I was due for surgery in March 2020. I had signed the consent forms and was just waiting to be called. My condition is uncomfortable but not urgent so I have to put up with it, but I can feel it getting a bit worse as the weeks have gone on.  I was to be signed off for two months so not a trivial operation. I am worried that if I catch the virus that coughing would make the condition much worse as it’s a soft tissue repair I need. Also, that I will need a bigger operation when the time does come that might be less successful. And finally, that the virus might get to me at the hospital or while I was recovering. Worst case I could cough the operation undone again!  I feel this hanging over me.  It also means I can’t do some exercises so keeping fit is harder. Other health things are also a nuisance. I was overdue for an eye test and definitely need new glasses – and then I broke a pair so I am very keen to get to an optician quite quickly, but no idea when that might be. I’m normally a very optimistic person, but the Covid19 situation has got to me a few times.  One night I just felt terrified for a couple of hours until I could reason myself out of it. Missing physical contact with our grown-up children most of all. The Government At the start I had complete confidence in the government. “this is what we British are good at” I thought. I expected us to have much better outcomes and lower deaths than the rest of the world not be amongst the worst in the world. It seems that we have all been shouting at out TV’s going ‘NO, we need to do X Y Z’.  Things that seem obvious common sense were just not applied. I feel embarrassed and sad and angry too. The ‘Dominic Cumming saga’ which involved the man who was the architect of the ‘Stay at home’ advice taking his sick wife 260 miles to Durham has caused nationwide fury.  One rule for us and one rule for him about sums it up. Some people have been fined for doing similar irresponsible things. On a lighter note it was fertile ground for lots of funny tweets and cartoons. I think the government won’t get any better at managing the situation. Some people will get very rich for the wrong reasons. Others will find their financial situation never recovers from losing their jobs or businesses or the first steps in their career due to the virus. The virus will linger. News I find the balance of news better on Channel 4 than on BBC whose reports seem thin.  We have not caught the 5pm news broadcasts but did see the special one at 7pm. At that one it did feel like a moment in history, quite unreal. There is no problem with access to the news, but access to stats that bear scrutiny has been a bit harder.  Initially only deaths in hospital were reported but then adjusted to include deaths in the community which caused a huge leap. But other respected apps give different numbers and, for example it seems impossible to understand how many people in total are estimated to have had the virus so far. As well as TV news I use Twitter a lot which gives the opportunity for seeing other opinions. I also try to listen to the world service to get an international perspective. I notice that a very small sign language person has popped up in the government briefings. I don’t have any problem, they are not distracting so if people find it useful then I’m very happy that they should stay. Technology Our company was already using video technology, but only just, so we have had to get up to speed quickly.  It’s OK for 121 meetings, but can be very tiring for group meetings, especially if they are for a full hour and are full of people going ‘I’m sorry you’re really faint’, and, ‘I just lost my connection, can you recap?’ The first really big meeting everyone quickly switched to audio only and I did not have much to say. Spotting the windows in the room were a bit grubby I found I was able to clean them very well while still listening in; satisfying multi-tasking. Now etiquette has evolved so that we are supposed to switch video on when we talk so it’s less easy to do, but I keep some sewing to hand, or something to do on another computer as I can’t bear just to sit doing nothing. I did try wearing different hats every time I spoke but got told off. Then a couple of weeks later someone else added a piece of clothing every time they were on screen until they were in full coat, hat and gloves. That time around it was appreciated. Perhaps it because it was a young man doing it instead of an older woman! We tried zoom for family, but its actually better to stick to speaking to one person otherwise you can’t get at what is bothering them, no one says anything personal in a group. We already used WhatsApp for close family and when I hear about very ancient pensioners getting to grips with this and zoom it makes me disappointed that neither my brother or sister will use it. It means we are left with stilted emails and makes me feel they don’t want to communicate with me. I have actually been writing more letters, mainly to older people who I have worried might be feeling lonely in lockdown.  Some of them have written much longer letters back which have been a joy. I have joined a family Facebook group for Australian relatives on my husband’s side of our family, but again my own relatives just don’t use social media, there seems to be a genetic aversion to it. Very frustrating. I put old photos on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram each day if possible and comment on other people’s posts. Managed to build my followers up quite a bit as I have a bit more time to do this. Shopping and food Shopping was a problem to start with supermarkets reserving online shopping for the vulnerable. So we tried to use offer click and collect, but are not accepting any new registrations at the moment. 7.30to 8am is reserved for NHS. 8-9am (Mon-Wed-Fri) is reserved for elderly.  Two metre distancing means a long queue just to get in a store and they advise you don’t come in the mornings when they are most busy.  But later in the day items were selling out. Many items were restricted to 2 per person. Opening times are reduced all stores close at 8pm. Government advice was not to shop more often than you need and try to shop online which was mutually exclusive to what the supermarkets could offer. I quite felt for people with large families who were told they could not have more than 2 of things. At first Tesco tried to tell my niece she had to enter the store alone, but didn’t have an answer for what she was supposed to do with a baby and a small child while she was in the store. She stood her ground and they did let her in after checking with the manager. It has taken a while for everyone to apply common sense. Could not get any onions or potatoes to plant.  Garden centres bursting with plants they are not allowed to sell – at a time when lots of people would be happy to do gardening. Many growers saying they will go bust as they can’t get their stock out to the market. Our village shop stayed open throughout. I used to volunteer there but its only now open 2 hours a day. Between 8 and 10 you can ring and place an order, then next two hours are for collecting.  The only place we can have a conversation is in the queue, from a distance and we are thankful it has been dry. Some shops have been very inventive. Many are taking orders by phone and delivering and guess what, they are finding it’s not so hard to do that rather than make everyone come to the shops, plus these are the shops that are doing well.  Two local pubs are now offering takeaway meals, order online and collect in the car park at a specified time. One of those pubs used to offer very expensive fine dining but now does hearty pub meals and says they are making more money for less hours. Meanwhile both the fish and chip shop and Chinese takeaways are shut ‘for the safety of staff and customers’. It can only be the government funding that is causing them to stay shut when they don’t have to.  The former just announced it will open next week – primarily because a café has now opened doing fish and chips and did a roaring trade on their first day, so suddenly they can see their future trade under threat.  A big mystery is our large hardware store, steadfastly staying shut when they did not have to be at all, and staying shut even though garden centres can now open. They have a huge airy store with only 4 staff on duty at any time. Again, it must be the furlough money and rates rebates that is stopping them opening. Our eating habits are the same, except for trying one of the takeaway pub meals. Missing having the odd meal out. Cooking is the same as always, but the flour shortage is annoying as we always made our own bread anyway. I do feel like cooking more, but have put on a few pounds in weight so that must go first as it makes my medical condition worse. Entertainment and Leisure I have still been working the same hours so apart from losing the commute I don’t have any more time. I go out almost everyday for a walk of at least half an hour. If I have to go shopping, I walk the quiet streets to get that in before doing the shop. On working days, as the weather has got warmer I’ve tried to walk before work as if ‘I’m walking to work’.  I have felt very connected to Spring and nature this year. Walking in the village most days I can see each small change, see which ewes have had a lamb or what trees have come into leaf or what flowers are out.  It’s been a pleasure and got me past a reluctance to walk some places since we lost our dog. It was hard going over those walks the first time, and the memories of our lovely dog made me quite tearful, but I was so bored with just walking around the village roads. We were renovating our house and our kitchen was about to be installed, but was stuck in a lockdown factory. So, we have been camping out much of the time using cardboard boxes and temporary surfaces. It is now fitted and finally all works.  Masses of decorating to do but plaster is in short supply and some trades are not working.  It’s down to who can afford not to work. Those who can have stayed at home. Those who are not getting any money from the schemes are very keen to carry on working. I have got to grips with a sewing machine I inherited, once I found the instructions it was a marvel. I have made curtains, altered clothes and have made a pile of more clothes to alter rather than dispose of. I’ve made dresses into skirts, taken in too baggy tops and mended things too. Plus, I’ve made a dozen washable face masks (with filter pocket) for us and my daughter out of old shirts, a pillowcase and some fabric shopping bags. I’ve also sanded down outside seats, but now find there is no paint to be found. It’s all sold out. I did have a push on sorting out cupboards and cleaning, but with bags of surplus things for charity shops and several bin bags for the tip piled up I’ve had to call a halt. We are watching the usual selection of programmes. My husband always prefers to pick from normal TV than search around iplayer, other channels. We like Killing Eve, This Country, Montalbano, history programmes and travel. We don’t subscribe to any packages partly because our internet is so flaky. It is so disappointing to watch a substantial amount of a programme for it to suddenly crash out. Once that happens it never comes back the rest of the evening. We do each watch utube videos as they are short. Its usually to learn how to do something, or to solve a techy problem. I had been piling up books ready for my operation so have had lots to read. I have been reading some new authors including Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, The Wilding by Maria McCann and Now We Shall be Entirely Free by Andrew Milller. Personal Hygiene Personal hygiene has not changed, but I’m not wearing make-up. I did to start with, but it got less and now hardly any. It would feel weird to put on lipstick when everyone knows you are just in your house. Same for jewellery. I stopped wearing a watch and my engagement ring as they are a nuisance when you are washing hands all the time. Now I have to remember to put in earrings every so often as I’m worried my ears will close up. I’ve dug out brooches, they have been unfashionable for some years, but they are ideal for zoom meetings and you don’t have to worry about the unreliable fastenings of the vintage ones as they can be taken off after the meeting.  As an older woman I do feel self-conscious on zoom and feel the brooches give people something to look at that isn’t my face. I like the way people on TV are having to broadcast from houses and that they look less glossy and made up.  All that perfection was such hard work and it’s telling us it’s OK to appear more normal. I’m washing my hair a bit less and its hard to do anything with it as it’s grown a straggly and an attempt at self-cutting was not that successful. What I do notice is my skin. I ran out of face-cream and simply could not get my usual one. I have bought different creams and even some skin brightening pads and serums and I am using them more, also body creams and its nice to have time to do things like painting toenails. I also have time to do my physio, and try to most days. It only takes 15 minutes but was hard to fit in on days I was working with a long commute. Sleep It took 2 months for the virus to enter my dreams in the form of a woman who was at a party and who refused to leave despite coughing and looking ill. Generally, my sleep is just the same hot flush interrupted event that is normal for me. It’s nice not to have to get up really early, feels like being on holiday. But some days I have got up quite early anyway because I like to accomplish things at the start of the day, preferably before breakfast. Sleeping in puts me in a bit of a bad mood."

Mass-Observer B7306 describes themself as female; age 87; widow; retired manager of Citizens Advice Bureau.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Health and wellbeing My first reaction to the question What does health mean to you? was that it is the absence of any symptom that indicates that the body is not working at peak efficiency. Being in good health means that you can ignore your body and get on with enjoying life. Any indication that here is a physical problem means that attention is switched to that part of the body that is not functioning properly. Wellbeing is simply being able to enjoy life without worry. It implies a balance between the bodily health and a frame of mind that is confident that you can cope with whatever the current situation may be. ’Comfortable in one’s skin’ Five words So the words that come to mind for me when I think of a healthy body are:-Functioning efficiently Pain free Disease free Firm flesh Clear skin I regard obesity as a symptom of unhealthiness. I deplore excessive eating and drinking as likely to create health problems. Similarly I hate smoking, having had parents who smoked constantly and whose health was affected by awful coughs and eventually death due to lung cancer. A healthy body If I think of a healthy body I picture my son at the age of 45. He was full of energy, ate sensibly, paying close attention to his diet to ensure it was balanced and to ensure that he had plenty of energy for his running. He was a keen long distance runner from his teenage years, and competed in marathons. Running gave him time to relax his mind and provided a release from the tensions of a busy life. Then in his 40s he discovered the challenge of triathlons which also required swimming and cycling proficiency. At 45 he completed the Monte Carlo Iron Man triathlon in a respectable time. Physically he was lean and muscular, when he gave me a hug his chest was firm and there was no flabby flesh anywhere on his body. He sparkled with energy and enjoyed his work, his family and life in general. He had a medical for insurance purposes at that age and the doctor commented that he was the healthiest person he had ever examined. Appearances and medical examinations can be deceptive, a few months later he died of a heart attack while out running. His arteries were found to be blocked, although his cholesterol level had always been low. No one could explain his untimely death although I have seen subsequently some research that points to sports stress as a cause. I do not think it is necessary to be an athlete to be healthy. A normal level of activity can be sufficient provided that sensible diet and life style are observed. I consider that some people become unhealthily obsessed with diet. In general if one is not in good physical health I am sure this destroys any feeling of wellbeing. Equally I am certain that poor mental health can lead to poor physical health. Wellbeing This is a concept that has been formulated in recent years. I had never thought of it when I was younger and bringing up a family on a tight budget. I had no experience or knowledge of mental health problems. There were times when life was not easy. I know that at times I felt anxious, and sometimes events made me feel low. However, it did not seem to be anything more than something to be endured and that it would eventually be resolved. I shared my worries with my husband and we got through the difficult times together. I did not spend time dwelling on the effect on my state of mind. Maybe in today’s more self conscious times I would have considered that I was mildly depressed at some points. We were of the generation who were brought up to accept that life could be difficult and that there was no point in wallowing in self pity. My own wellbeing was always a secondary consideration in the overall welfare of the family. If everyone else was happy and healthy, that was my reward for any sacrifices I had made. The absence of any acceptable child care or consideration of maternity leave in the 1960s meant that I had to give up a satisfying and remunerative job when we had children. I found life as a housewife and the mother of small children could be hard work and not always particularly stimulating. I missed the company of the work team and the stimulation of my job. Ideally I would have liked to work part time. I managed to keep engaged with the world outside the home by a variety of voluntary projects, some evening class learning and eventually voluntary, later paid, worthwhile work. We saved hard to buy our first house before we had children and have always been fortunate to have enough money to provide food and warmth. Throughout our married lives we put the welfare of the family first and did not pursue material gains or luxuries. Our wellbeing as parents was being rewarded by seeing the three children grow up to be self confident, well adjusted and happy adults with good careers. I think our own needs were sublimated to the needs of family. When we felt down hearted we talked the problem through and gave one another support. It never occurred to either of us to seek outside help. In retirement and once our children were independent, we became more self indulgent, enjoying more activities and holidays. For us both it had always been important to have interests of our own as well as a joint social life and holidays together. I consider that this independence of interests and activities maintained a healthy lively mind in each of us which contributed to our wellbeing and saved us from getting bored. I have avoided mentioning mental illness. I define this as a diagnosed mental condition which may well be a threat to the wellbeing of the individual. Two of our children have been diagnosed in adulthood as being mildly bipolar. They have medication which seems to be effective in maintaining an equilibrium. Sadly my husband was diagnosed when he was 75 with Parkinsons and developed dementia. For five years he deteriorated physically and for two years I watched him gradually lose his former personality and intellect. This is a devastating illness and difficult to cope with for the patient and carer. I cared for him until the last six weeks of his life. His erratic behaviour required constant vigilance both during the day and at night. I was exhausted and stressed. I was too busy at the time to think about the impact of the toll this imposed on me, but I am sure that by any wellbeing measurement I was not in a good place. His wellbeing was much worse. However I do not regret that I chose to look after him for as long as I could in familiar surroundings. We had been mutually supportive for over fifty years and I wanted him to be as happy as possible, but it was not fun. I retrospect I am surprised that we coped as well as we did, with a lot of useful devices from Social Services and some respite care for a couple of hours from Crossroads each week. Our children helped as much as they could by coming to see us. They encouraged me to take a break, so I arranged for him to be cared for in a residential home for the occasional week. The link between wellbeing and physical health is difficult to quantify but I am convinced that my unexpected need to have a heart bypass was the result of the stress of caring for him. I did not have a heart attack and like my son, I had never had a high cholesterol score. Wellbeing is not an aspect of life that I have ever actively considered. I believe in coping as well as I can with the difficulties that occur. I know that the modern way is to talk about your feelings but I have never found this easy other than with my husband. Maybe because we were so close I have not felt the need to talk to others. I have been a widow for nearly ten years and I have been able to rebuild my life. I enjoy active participation in a number of groups and enjoy holidays with my sister and my children and grandchildren. My son and daughter are very solicitous and check that I am awake each morning, with telephone contact each week. I am in daily contact with a sister by e mail. My wellbeing is nurtured by these contacts. I consider myself to be very fortunate to be currently in reasonably good health and spirits. I like being independent, and have found that living on my own enables me to be completely selfish. I have chosen to stay in the house where we have lived for forty years where I enjoy my garden. This is an essential part of my feeling of wellbeing. The solitude of lock down has been unwelcome but in general I am quite content with my own company. Phone calls and Zoom meetings maintain contact with friends. Influence of gender, social class, ethnicity, sexual orientation I do not consider that I my attitudes or experiences have ben particularly influenced by any of these. My experiences of pregnancy and giving birth are naturally exclusively female. As an educated middle class person I have been spared the hardship which I know less fortunate people may suffer leading to poorer health. I have been grateful for the NHS and never sought private treatment. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My mother had trained as a nurse before her marriage. From an early age we were trained in the importance of cleanliness. Hands were always washed before meals. We were scrubbed and inspected to make sure we were clean. Any cuts were scrupulously cleaned and anointed with Mercurochrome, the red paint alternative to iodine. We were made aware of the existence of dangerous germs which could be transmitted by coughing and sneezing, we were warned never to drink from a cup or glass used by another person. All this information was instilled at an early age when I cannot recall conversations. (I was appalled to be introduced to Postmans Knock at a party when I was five as I considered it to be very unhygienic, and to this day I am affronted when I see people sharing drinks). TB was the hidden killer in the 1930s which my mother warned us about. Up to the age of seven when our lives changed completely* I think my sister and I were kept in a family bubble to protect us from germs, as looking back we were not encouraged to go into other peoples houses or mix with strangers. (* we were refugees in Surrey during the war and lived in a succession of billets with few possessions, sleeping in a coal cellar in 1944 to shelter from the doodlebugs) I had a succession of ear infections in my childhood and it was decided that I needed my tonsils removed (aged 4/5). My mother was so suspicious of the poor hygiene at the local hospital that she persuaded our doctor to operate on me at home, assisting him herself. She prepared the kitchen table as though it was an operating theatre and the deed was done there. I do not remember the operation but relished the extra attention and occupying my parents’ bed! I was told about the birth of babies from an early age,(but not the mechanics of conception), and as I was the eldest of five children was familiar with having babies in the family. So when we received sex education at the age of thirteen at school there were few surprises. The only vaccination I received was against smallpox and we were immunised against diphtheria, at the age of about eight, in 1941/2. Being ill was something we experienced as a norm in childhood. There was a certain glamour about being in bed during the day and having more attention than usual with visitors being solicitous and special tempting food. We did not get up and roam around when we had a temperature but were encouraged to stay quiet and drink plenty of water. There were no antibiotics to effect a miracle cure. Our mother moved into ‘nurse mode’ and monitored us carefully. If the doctor was called he was provided with a clean towel for washing his hands. Unlike my grandchildren, we expected to get the infectious diseases of childhood for which no vaccine existed at the time. I remember having measles, chickenpox and whooping cough before puberty. I waited to catch mumps and rubella until I was an adult. When I was at secondary school there was an outbreak of polio which one of my friends caught. TB also affected some of my acquaintances. Apart from infectious disease, I was prone to get styes on my eyelids which had to be bathed in sterile water. My own approach to illness was conditioned by my early training and experiences as a child, so my children had similar treatment when ill. From 1945, at the age of twelve, I was living as a boarder in a guest house owned by a family friend and going home to Jersey for holidays. I do not think anyone talked about my health, I was responsible for deciding what happened and I do not recall having a single day off school in five years. I attended with streaming colds and hacking coughs. My relationship with the family friend was not one where I would have discussed my health, or she to nurse me if I had been unwell. I do not think I was registered with a doctor and fortunately was never seriously ill. At school we had medical examinations, possibly every other year, I cannot remember. My short sight was identified when I was fourteen and I was prescribed spectacles. I do not remember any lessons which dealt with health other than the sex education lectures, delivered by an outside agency. These were three sessions, male, female and baby. They were discontinued after a couple of years. When I went home to Jersey I remember having a check up at the doctors on one occasion. We did not discuss health as a family. I was prepared for menstruation with sanitary towels by my mother. I already knew about it from an early age. However, menstruation was a subject which was rarely mentioned, referred to as ‘the curse’. A useful source of education was found in the Tampax packets which I was able to use to help younger pupils who asked for advice on using tampons, thinking that maybe you had to swallow them! The concept of wellbeing had not been invented, as far as I am aware. The main threat to my peace of mind was the fear of becoming unintentionally pregnant before we were ready to start a family. I had three pregnancies and was well prepared by relaxation classes. My husband was the first father to attend a birth at the local hospital when our first child was born. The second and third were born at home. They were among the most exciting moments of my life. Throughout my adult years I have had smear tests and mammograms when these became available. I was only briefly on the pill when my husband had a vasectomy. It gave me dreadful head aches, this was in the early days of development (?1969/70). The existence of PMT first became discussed when I was about fifty and I remember going to a lecture (by Doctor Dalton?) on this new development in medical opinion. As one for whom it was a problem, causing migraines, I tentatively mentioned it to my doctor but medication not offered, I think some doctors still believed it was a mental condition. Key moments I was a year younger than the others in my class, so they reached puberty before I did. I was relieved when I developed breasts at about the age of 14 and started menstruating. Menstruation must be a major landmark in any girl’s life. I particularly objected to not wearing a bra when everyone else did. Teenage modern underclothing is designed to mask the immature breasts and must save considerable embarrassment among growing girls who have to endure communal changing rooms. I think that the first bra probably has less significance today as there are teen tops which take the girl through the transition stage. For boys I think the first sprouts of chest hair are significant as are facial hair and changes in voice timbre. Neither of my sons experienced the archetypal embarrassing voice break. Growing older – wellbeing The greatest blow to my wellbeing has been the loss of my ability to drive, it has reduced my independence and the spontaneity of activity which I previously enjoyed so much. However, I use taxis and public transport and have a bus stop on my doorstep and have had to accept the limitations. Bodily health I have always tried to observe any changes in my body and sought medical advice if they persist. I do not detect any change in vigilance as I age. My information comes from reading press and magazine articles (Saga Magazine), radio and with reference to the internet. I have been lucky to keep fit during most of my adult life. My eyes are my weakness and I had a detached retina in 2000 aged 67. The recovery period after the operation to repair this was very taxing: for a fortnight I had to keep my head parallel to the ground, sleeping face downwards and head bowed all day, except for ten minutes respite. Subsequently I have had cataract operations which were less traumatic. I had not had an anaesthetic since I was nine when I had teeth removed to make space, This was a ghastly experience leaving me with nightmares for years afterwards. I was pleased to discover that modern procedures are much less unpleasant. I was 76 when I had a heart bypass, as mentioned above. I was terrified at the prospect and relieved when after twelve weeks convalescence I returned to normal. When I was 79 a hysterectomy revealed cancer at an early stage, following a succession of dubious smears and minor operations, it has not recurred. I am a devout coward and was a reluctant but eventually grateful patient. I monitor my blood pressure at the request of the doctor and try to keep my diet as healthy as possible. At my age I hope to stay mobile and to retain my hearing and sight at a level which enable me to continue to enjoy life. Health, wellbeing and appearance The appearance of a person, particularly as they age, is very indicative of how they are feeling. A spring in the step, upright carriage, glowing complexion and sparkling eyes are some of the indications of good health. Care in dressing smartly and looking after their hair and hands indicates a degree of self care associated with good wellbeing. An obese person does not look attractive to me as I feel it indicates neglect of sensible eating and probably poor health. I am aware that some people are unable to control their weight but it still looks unattractive to me, what ever the cause. I am quite sure that when I was young I aspired to look like Grace Kelly. I had a tiny waist as was fashionable and was proud of my appearance. Although I did not consider myself unhealthy, I found my appearance when pregnant unattractive, particularly as the fashionable dress at the time was the miniskirt! It was difficult to feel attractive, and maternity clothing was ugly and not functional, unlike today. When I was at work in an office I wore ‘professional dress’, a suit in winter and dresses in summer. Although I now wear trousers most of the time, I did not wear them to work. I did not follow fashion slavishly but kept smart and well groomed. As a mature woman I have not felt inspired to look like anyone else. I have never worried about my appearance. It is not something that interests me greatly. My mother tended to choose striking clothes for me which made me feel conspicuous and my own taste was more sober. I do not enjoy buying clothes, but I believe that I should make an effort to be as smart as possible. It enhances my self respect. During lock down I have relaxed my normal dress habits somewhat and tend not to wear jewellery or lipstick at home. My mother had been a very fashionable young woman, but during the war she had hardly any clothes, while in post war years austerity meant that the choice of clothes was very limited and she was far from smart.. This is the period when I remember her best. However, in her mid 50s she was transformed. With all the children at school, she started working with my father in the family jewellery business. From a dowdy housewife she became a very fashionably dressed woman, with hair dressed professionally and expensive make up and perfume, and always in very high heels with lots of jewellery. I found this amazing and excessively extravagant. However, working in a shop that sold luxury goods I suppose it it was perfectly understandable. My father admired attractive women and was doubtless pleased that she made this impression as befitted the business. At the time I was working in the CAB where our clients were not always affluent and I would have been totally inappropriate dressed in such finery! In any case it was not to my taste, or pocket, to appear so extremely fashionably dressed and primped. I have never aspired to be extensively made up but would always like to have a lipstick to lift my mood. However I think my desert island item would be moisturiser. Getting ready to leave the house I really cannot remember my mother getting ready for going out as when I lived at home she hardly left the house. She was too busy looking after the large family. On the rare occasions we went shopping she would slap on a dash of lipstick and powder her nose. This all contrasts with her appearance later in life, long after I had left home. I always put moisturiser on when I get dressed. When I am going out I renew my lipstick and do my hair which I wear swept up in a bun. I put earrings on, if not already in place. If it is a social occasion I may put on a puff of perfume. I have not changed this routine over all my adult years."

Everyday Health and Wellbeing My opinion of health is something that we take for granted until something goes wrong, and  my younger self certainly never gave it a thought. Since I  retired,  I appreciate it every day.  The word wellbeing to me is a relatively modern ideal, that I certainly do not recall hearing when I was growing up. My own reading of it is feeling happy and healthy, so  basically I think of it as an umbrella term for mental and physical health. A healthy body – Free from pain and illness I do like to see athleticism and and smooth movement at any level, whatever the age. To me the most perfect advertisement for this is the tennis player, Roger Federer, a joy to watch. He floats around the court effortlessly, the body working to perfection. Sadly, it appears that health and wellbeing is indeed influenced by gender or class. In many cases girls become less active throughout their teenage years, and unless they develop an interest in fitness and diet as they grow into adulthood, it is possible that their health may not receive the attention that it deserves. This applies to both sexes of course. Good health is something to be treasured, and over indulgence in food, drink, tobacco or drugs will only hamper the process. As far as I can remember, the first time that I became aware of the term health was in the title of a book named  Health and Hygiene. I joined the British Red Cross Junior section when I was 9 years old, and aside from a First Aid Manual, we were given this book. I read it over and over again, and still have it, in fact. My parents and the school were responsible for promoting good healthy ways of living, and I firmly believe that  growing up in the 50s was more advantageous  than  doing so in the present day. Comparatively few people had cars in those days, so we always walked to school, and PE was given due prominence on the school timetable. All through junior school I walked home for lunch, and my dear mum always made sure that I had a good  meal of meat and two or three veg every day. At school we were given  a third of a bottle of milk every day during morning playtime. We had all the usual childhood illnesses like measles and chickenpox, and received polio vaccine on sugar lumps at school.  I lived in Wales, up to the age of seven,  and whenever I was ill, I would be moved into the larger second bedroom. Mum would light the fire, and  bring my meals on a tray and dose me up with Lucozade. No TV in bedrooms in those days of course, so I would happily read for hours on end, and Mum would play board games with me. Being kept at home to get better was no hardship to me at all. A6936 Unlike today, when children seem to mature much earlier, we were blissfully unaware of puberty changes throughout junior school. That was to change on entry to senior school at the age of 11, and during the summer holidays of that year,  Mum told me about some of the changes due to happen to me as a teenager. On the first day at our new school we were herded into the assembly hall to listen to a talk from the Headmaster, welcoming us to the school. Then the boys were told to leave, and were shepherded away under the supervision of the Head of boys' PE. The girls were left to the mercy of the  equivalent head of  the girls' department, a lady who shared the name of a Hollywood actress of the 40s and 50s. She certainly did not fit  the archetypal PE teacher, and was quite flamboyant in her methods. Her first question was to ask the crowded hall of apprehensive 11 year olds was how many girls  had started their periods. The silence was deafening and only a brave few put their hands up. Miss R then asked them to stand up and call out their names. The poor girl next to me whispered in my ear that she had started the day before, but no way was she going to tell the old bag that!!  One of the unfortunates who had put their hand up was forced to confess that she had started at the ridiculously early age of 9 and a half, and this fact  was never forgotten. ( perhaps this was a marker for early maturity, as I recall her boasting, when we were in the fourth year, that she had lost her virginity to a bus conductor in the  upstairs back seat of a double decker during the 10 minute break at the local bus terminus. Whoever said that romance is dead!) After that we were given a talk by the esteemed head of girls' PE about what we were to expect from  puberty but I honestly don't recall any content at all, after that auspicious start. During the first two to three years of our time at the school, we all experienced the changes of puberty, and always took great pleasure in sharing these facts with our friends. I vividly recall my Mum giving me my first bra; size 32A from Woolworths, and it had tiny pink roses on it. Showers after PE lessons were an opportunity to check on each other, as to who was growing the biggest boobs, or the growth of hair in the most unexpected places. Then the excitement of starting periods at the end of the summer holidays, before the third year. I couldn't wait to tell my friends about it, as I was secretly envious of those who had already achieved this milestone. When I got on the bus on the first day of term, a girl that I couldn't stand, the News of the World of our year, was already telling the the whole bus of her own experience during the holidays. She had beaten me to it, but I didn't care, as I would never have gone about it like she had, so I kept quiet. When I got to school, I told some of my friends at registration, and was amazed to find that two others had also started, so the summer of 1964 was momentous for all of us, and I have never forgotten it. Not that  I was in a hurry to grow up, far from it. Like many adolescents, I felt awkward, and as I was so tall and gangly, had clumsiness off to a fine art.. But the 60s were a good time to be a teenager, and they were very happy days. Growing older, as I have said previously, I appreciate my health more than ever. As a life long sport lover, fitness has always been of prime importance to me, so I do everything I can to maintain it. Throughout my life I have held the view that life would not be worth living if I couldn't be active. I have kept a diary since the age of 14, and always write in red the sport or activity that I have done that day. Obviously there was lot of red ink during school and college days,  and then working as a PE teacher. Even then I went to a Keep Fit class twice a week for the sheer pleasure of being part of a class, rather than running it. The Services provided lots opportunity for sport and fitness, and when I joined the Civil Service I cycled to work, played badminton or went swimming at lunchtimes. In retirement, for almost 10 years I belonged to a Community Exercise programme, run by Bristol University, for retirees, which provided classes in aerobics, aquafit and circuits, plus access to all gym facilities. Since then, l have taken out swimming membership at my local pool, so in normal times I go lane swimming most days. The day before my 70th birthday, in December 2020, I swam 70 lengths front crawl in 45 minutes. That was the last time  I was in the pool, prior to Lockdown  3 and I cannot A6936 wait to start again. At the moment , my exercise regime is restricted to walking and cycling, and I have never felt so unfit. That most certainly does not give a feeling of wellbeing, physically or mentally, and I absolutely have to remedy it. I wouldn't say that I am influenced by popular ideas. I do enjoy watching health programmes, relating to diet and exercise, but like many others, it's just a case of reinforcing what I have always felt, and that it's a case of preaching to the converted. I try to eat healthily, but no way am I a paragon of virtue, and I like alcohol and chocolate as much as anyone. I do subscibe to the theory that if you feel good, it reflects itself in your personal appearance. I follow my parents in this, although my Mum was always far more particular with her clothes and hair than I am. Her clothes were chosen with care, and to have colours matching was most important. I do remember them going out together and Dad having to wait ages for her to get ready. He would pace the hall, looking at his watch,  occasionally calling up the stairs asking if she was ready. She always looked smart when she went out, and people were still commenting on this, even when she went into her care home at the age of 94. When I was going through her clothes after she died, just over 2 months ago, I found it very hard to deal with, as I could picture her wearing them, all matching. Regretfully, I have not inherited her talent for choosing the right clothes for the occasion. When I was growing up, Mum tried desperately to encourage me to dress nicely and be ladylike! Bless her, it was an uphill battle that she didn't have a hope of winning. I relish the freedom of wearing jeggings, tops and trainers, and that is my standard uniform. I have long hair and never had a shampoo and set in my life. I did flirt with Shaggers perms in the 80s, but basically my hairstyle hasn't changed a lot over the years. Having to put my hair in a bun when in uniform was torture! My desert island staple that l couldn't live without, is moisturiser. I have dry skin and mild eczema, so would scratch myself to pieces without it. So now in my ripe old age, I stick firmly to my long held principle that age is just a label, and no way am I ever go to act it. I know of people who decided that it was all downhill after the age of 60, but that is not my way of living. I count myself as very very lucky to be part of the Baby Boomer generation, and I want to get as much out of life as possible,as do many others that I know with a similar outlook. If you don't use it, you lose it, is a commonly expressed mantra. Good health is to be cherished at all costs."

I developed a skin problem over the Easter weekend, and after several weeks of buying various items of cream over the counter with no success, I was advised to contact my GP.  Like all surgeries it was closed to patients during the pandemic, so I was very reluctant to do so. I actually waited a couple of days, but when I did  eventually relent, I as was very impressed to be given a triage appointment that morning. I was given a prescription which the doctor offered to have delivered for me . I replied that would not be necessary as l could easily call in at the chemist while on my daily constitutional. She was quite surprised at that, and asked how l was coping living alone, and did l want my shopping done for me as well. I felt really touched at that, but explained  that although my date of birth does not lie, l had always blatantly ignored my age and  maintained that it is merely a label. As l said, I was very impressed by her offer, told her so, and assured her that I would seek help from one of her team of volunteers if I ever needed it. I was even more impressed a couple of weeks later when I had to ring again as another more potent skin condition had emerged. Without hesitation she asked me to come to the surgery that morning as she needed to see the rash. She warned me that she would be in full PPE and that I would need to have my temperature taken at the door, and use hand sanitizer. The normally crowded waiting room had one occupant, and half a dozen chairs were arranged in a  large circle in the middle of the room, naturally well spaced apart. As usual I had taken a book with me, but I hadn't read many pages before a slight figure emerged dressed in scrubs, mask, gloves  and plastic visor. This figure is the Senior Partner in this practice and here she was coming along the corridor to call out my name, rather than using the normal tv screen. I was examined quickly and professionally,  prescribed steroid cream, and told that it would be ready for collection in 10 minutes. I couldn't thank her enough, and told her that I would clap for her during the weekly Clap for Carers that evening. An amazing woman, who told me to stay safe as I left. I replied that it was far more important that she stayed safe. Many people have needed dental treatment during lockdown, which must be especially difficult if in pain. A friend was due to pick up a denture plate from her dentist, just as lockdown started. So she has spent the past two months trying to adapt to eating with three missing teeth! I  have a denture which l managed to drop in the sink quite early on in lockdown, but thankfully it didn't break in half. A chunk of vinyl did fall off though, leaving a jagged edge which kept digging into my gum. So, necessity being the Mother of Invention, I attacked it with an emery board and managed to smooth it down a bit. Not perfect, but not much else l can do at the moment. I can still eat, and play my clarinet and trombone, so why worry? As for my emotions during the pandemic, l assume like most people that I will definitely  not look back on this period with fond recollection. Immediately prior to lockdown, and for the first few weeks, I watched and listened to everything that I could about the pandemic. If I woke up early, I would listen to the radio, until it dawned on me that all this was doing was making me quite frightened and too much of it was infinitely depressing. Now, I don't turn on the television until the 5.00 pm briefing from Downing Street.  I have kept a diary since I was 14, and a journal for the past 11 years. On March 19th I decided to start a separate Corona Journal. For several weeks I wrote pages and pages, detailing everyday news issued by the government, and chronicling my own thoughts. After about two months of that, my enthusiasm waned. I still keep it up to date, but the written content has definitely got less. It seems that we have been in lockdown for such a long time, but of course it isn't. By contrast, the days seem to go very quickly and I always have something to do. The Government I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the government, particularly the Prime Minister. His lifetime ambition was to be PM. Would he have wanted it this way, I wonder. No leader has had to tackle a crisis like this, and I think that he has done as good a job as he possible could. When the poor fella was admitted to hospital with covid I thought the reaction was incredible. Even non Tories were horrified at the thought of the nation's leader being so desperately ill, and a lot of fear was felt through the country. We only have to look across the Pond to see how lucky we are! Obviously mistakes have been made, and there are things that would have been done differently. The government have had to grapple daily with nightmare decisions that none of us would want to make. The Health Secretary in particular has risen to the challenge, I feel, and comes across as someone who genuinely cares. Baby steps are being taken to take us gradually out of lockdown. As always the government follow the scientific advice, but whatever decision they make seems open to critisism that they are moving too quickly, or too slowly. They are damned if they do, and damned if they don't. A delicate balance between the health of the nation, and the economy. We seem to be on the verge of the New Normal. One assumes that this will continue until a vaccine is developed. News The BBC have always been my chosen news broadcaster, and despite frequent claims of left wing bias, I have not felt the need to change my opinion. Throughout the day I listen to BBC local radio or radio channels  2. or 5 live. The Downing Street briefing at 5.00 has been essential viewing throughout the pandemic, much as the 6.00 news on the wireless was essential listening during WWII. To me the most impressive contributors are the scientists, especially Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The authoratative  manner with which they deliver facts and figures with graphs, and above all the way they deal with the trucculent journalists and answer their inane questions, is a masterclass. My friends also watch the briefing, but almost all turn it off when it is the turn of the journalists  to fire their pointless repetitive questions, and spout their totally negative views and criticism at the lone politician on the spot. I stick with it right through, and do my bit and pour scorn on the journalists for thinking that they could do better. To be fair to the BBC, they have now introduced BSL to their coverage of the briefing on their dedicated news channel, which is a very positive development Work and home life From the very start of the lockdown I have counted myself very fortunate to be retired on a pension, and to live in my own house with no rent to pay. My generation, The Baby Boomers are often called the luckiest generation, and the current situation more than supports that viewpoint. I feel very sorry for  schoolchildren and university students who have had their education interrupted. The years between 5 and 18 cannot be got back. For those currently in employment, their future must be so uncertain, and as for those owning their own business, the strain must be intolerable. Two of my relatives and one of my friends are furloughed, and are very anxious to learn whether there will be a job to go back to when the scheme ends. Yes, lockdown has its challenges, but I have not been affected by the issues raised in your question. Technology At the beginning of March, I suspect that those of us not involved in video conferencing in the workplace would never have heard of Zoom. It has become a part of everyday life overnight. I have discovered it due to the efforts of the musical director of two of the bands  to which I belong. He uses it through his work and has adapted the application to provide band sessions twice a week. Normally around 50 – 70% of the bands sign in to these sessions and it has given us an incentive to keep practicing, and it's great to see friends on the screen. My own preferred method of everyday communication with family and friends is still the phone, despite the glut of other options available. My Mum's care home has Facetime, which is ideal for relatives living a distance away, but I  am fortunate that Mum is on the ground floor, so I can ring her, and  at the same time be able to see her through the window. I also  use e mail , texting and Messenger   to communicate with friends, During the first few weeks of lockdown it was interesting to see that many of us started communicating with ex work colleagues by phone or e mail, definitely progressing from the usual hurried message on a Christmas card! Shopping and food My experience of food shopping has been very good. I have a  large superstore of a well know chain 100 yards away, but for many years I have  preferred to use a smaller version a couple of miles away. The week or so before lockdown was manic, as it was everywhere, and shopping became quite a scary experience amidst the panic buying frenzy. However, within a couple of weeks, strict measures had been introduced, and order was restored. I have to admit that I was quite daunted by the sight of a queue snaking around the car park, everyone keeping to the 2m distance rule. Sanistising spray and paper towel was provided to wipe down the trolley handles, then I  joined the queue. I was there  for 20 minutes, but that was no problem as the weather was clement.  The store was very strict about only allowing a certain number of people inside at one time, and arrows on the floor sent out a strong message that progress around the shop was one way only. My immediate impression was the comforting sense of space, and almost everyone observed the social distancing rules and politely stood aside for people. There was a bit of a queue for the checkouts, but again it was well organised, and the cashiers were well protected with screens and hatching on the floor clearly indicated the space that should be kept clear. As the weeks have gone on, I have found that Monday afternoons are a good time to shop as there is no queue at all to get in, and I  can honestly say that shopping is quite a pleasant experience. I always tell the cashier this as I pack my goods, and praise the management of the store. They are doing an excellent job in trying circumstances. My cooking or eating habits have not changed. Entertainment and Leisure At the start of lockdown, I decided that to use the time constructively I would devise a  timetable to be followed each day. Things I don't like doing – housework, grass cutting  and decluttering. The latter had constantly been put off as I was never at home long enough to do it. Now I had no excuse. Exercise Music Reading and writing Evening – TV, phone calls and e mails Needless to say, the timetable structure did not last long. I still do all of the above, but not in the structured way that I had intended. Exercise is no problem as I am a lifelong fitness fanatic. I have had a go at  several on line fitness programmes, and now  I cycle or walk virtually every day, but nothing compares to swimming. Unless I choose to swim in the sea I will just have to wait until I can continue my favourite sport. Indeed I have never walked as much as I do now. I am lucky enough to live opposite a park, and I have grown to appreciate it very much. It has a beautiful lake and wooded walks, and I, and many others, have really noticed, and  appreciated nature this year as never before. This is one of the few positives that I have gained from lockdown. I have always been an avid reader, and am grateful for my well-stocked bookcases. I have read lots of detective fiction, and thrillers, amongst others. History continues to be a passion and a lot of the TV that I watch is historical,  or nostalgia related. Some film channels have been opened up free of charge, so I have taken advantage of that to watch films that I have probably seen before, but still enjoy. The same goes for some of my reading. It's good to go back to happier times, and I love watching  repeats of favourite dramas. Music-wise, I know that some of my friends have been very diligent about practicing, but I have not. I blow very hot and cold, and sometimes devote more time to trying to improve my piano playing, rather than the clarinet or trombone. I still listen to music avidly, and it can lift the mood when the news bulletins become too depressing. As for the decluttering, I have at last applied myself to it during the past few weeks, as I now have a goal. Spending so much time in my house, where I have had many happy years, I have discovered during lockdown that  I would  actually like to move to another area,  sooner rather than later. So a new project has evolved. Personal hygiene The only change I can think of is not washing my hair so often. It would normally get washed every day after swimming, and now it's just every other day. I cut my fringe, and am not bothered about not being able to go to the hairdressers. My hair is blonde/grey and I am glad that I have never had it coloured. On a slightly different tack, I normally  never go out without wearing mascara. I haven't used it for weeks now, as my social life has been somewhat curtailed! When I am outdoors I wear sunglasses anyway, so there is no point is there? I most certainly will resume wearing it though when normal life resumes, as blonde eyelashes look almost  invisible.  Sleep At the start of lockdown I learnt that it was foolhardy to listen to the radio in the middle of the night – much too depressing. If I go to bed too early I don't sleep well, so I normally turn in between 1130 and midnight. I always read before putting the light out. I do tend to wake up quite early, probably around 6.00 and sometimes tune in to the breakfast radio programmes, Sometimes they do send me back to sleep, and that is when I have experienced some very strange dreams. They are very vivid at the time, but quickly forgotten."

So when, as has often been the case over the last year, someone says “Oh well, at least we’ve got our health”, I would take that to mean, at least we are physically healthy. Wellbeing, on the other hand, encompasses both physical and mental health, so to me it’s about taking a holistic approach to health, for example eating a good diet and exercising, not only as a way of preserving physical health, but a way of looking after mental health as well. When I imagine a healthy body I think of the words: slim, toned, smoke-free, exercise, vegetables I don’t think of a specific person – I guess I think of a generic ‘fit’ woman body that we see plastered over social media constantly, so a slim woman in a crop top, leggings, trainers with a white-toothed smile and sparkly eyes. This is what we’re all supposed to look like after our 5am yoga session followed by herbal tea and some overnight oats. My own experience of health has definitely been influenced by my gender – well sex, if we’re being picky, because most of the health issues I’ve had have been a direct result of being female: ectopic pregnancy, impact of c-section and pregnancy, POI (premature ovarian insufficiency/early menopause). Picked up on Sat 30 Jan 2021 All of the above health issues have been problematic for me. I was treated really badly in hospital after the ectopic and in the end had to seek support from a charity and via my employer’s private counselling service. With the c-section, I found it pretty shocking how quickly I was expected to just get on with it. I left hospital less than 48 hrs after I’d given birth and had to inject myself with painkillers. My stitches split a few days later and I had to rush back into hospital. The POI has been the worst tho. I’ve been passed from pillar to post and have had to push so hard to get seen by a specialist. I’m now on the third or fourth regime of treatment, which I’ll be on for the next 10 years under annual review. It feels like such a fight. I know it’s a cliché to say, but if these were issues that men faced, I think they would be taken much more seriously. I learnt about health from my mum. Really, the extent of it was eat healthy foods and get fresh air and exercise. My mum had (and has, actually) a real aversion to me being ill. It felt like I wasn’t allowed to be ill. The attitude was ‘oh just get on with it’. I think that’s partly why even now I find it hard to stop and take a day off even when I am ill. I’ve gone to work with really bad back pain, bad depression, colds of course – I’ve even worked through a painful bout of the shingles. I’m getting better at stopping now and realising when I need to take care of myself. I’ve not really become aware of wellbeing until the last 5-10 yrs I guess. Partly because I don’t think it was a thing. Health was all about physical health, not mental health. I think it’s much better now there’s a general recognition that the two go hand in hand. C3210 I don’t remember being taught much about health at school. A bit in science classes I suppose and we probably learnt a bit about nutrition in ‘Home Economics’. These days I mostly learn from articles on the internet or in magazines and books – but I’m careful about what I read. I won’t just believe any old  hokum. If I’m looking for information about specific conditions I will always look on the NHS website. I think I was first aware of puberty when I got my period – actually probably when my twin sis got hers – about a month before mine. We’d had the ‘period talk’ at school, so I knew what to expect. Mum didn’t talk to us much about it, though I remember her saying she’d show me how to insert a tampon if I wanted. That really grossed me out and I said thanks but no thanks. I also remember furtively trying to shave my legs with my dad’s bic razor. I was so scared about being found that I took it into the little loo with a sponge and did it there. Not very successfully I think! Looking back I really took my body for granted – I hardly exercised and yet really I must have been really slim. I think I must have had a high metabolism, because I used to eat so much junk when I was with friends. When I was at uni I went through a period of not being able to eat. I don’t think it was anorexia because I wanted to eat, but the thought of food made me feel sick. God it must have been a worry for my mum. I remember I used to go to the supermarket and walk up and down, up and down until I saw something, anything that I felt like eating. I guess it must have been some anxiety or something. I was so thin, nearly 3st lighter than now (I’m between 11.5-12 stone now and 5ft 10). I only ever swam once a week, if that. I’ve always enjoyed swimming. When I first moved to London I went once a week. I was eating a lot more than I do now but again, managed to stay around 10st. Actually I think I was walking for about 30 mins a day as part of my commute, so I guess that helped. But I was drinking a lot! Now I know I have to make exercise part of my routine. Partly for my back and general health, but also for my mental health. After I moved to Watford I joined a gym and I was going to 2/3 classes a week and running. It helped me pull myself out of a dark period in my life. That’s why I’m finding the winter lockdown so difficult – after the last lockdown I’d starting going back to the pool 2-3 times a week – I injured my ankle last June so haven’t run since then and with it being winter it’s difficult to fit running round work and home­schooling. Right now I’m really not doing much exercise at all and I can feel it. A has bought some resistance bands and I’ve done a session this morning. I’m also trying to do some yoga. Now I can see the positive benefits of exercise, especially on my mental health, I’m more keen to try and fit it in. I really want to buy a folding exercise bike, but they’re all out of stock. I’m looking forward to the clocks changing so there’s more light. I think I will try running again then. As I get older I know I will prioritise exercise. Even though it does give me a mental high, if I could get away without doing it and sitting and reading a book instead, then I would. But I know I need to do it to stay healthy, especially as I sit at a computer every day for work. I do see a connection between a healthy lifestyle and physical appearance but I try to keep reminding myself that the beautiful people plastered over Instagram etc probably spend a lot more time and money on it than I’ll ever be able to. Also, I like food. I have friends who love me for who I am, not what I look like. So even though we’d all like to have a flat tummy and look like we just woke up from 10 hours sleep, really I’d rather eat the cake and have a laugh than spend all that time and energy analysing everything I put in my body just so I can show a six pack on Instagram. It must be so boring. The one thing that really bothers me about my appearance, and is probably linked to my wellbeing, is my dark circles. There’s hardly a month that goes by when I don’t buy yet another product that will apparently rid me of them. Of course what would really work is different genes and a cure for insomnia. Right now they’re really bad because I’m starting work at 7am every day and get only 4-5 hours sleep a night. They are the first thing I see when I look in the mirror and they make me feel like shit. Also it really pisses me off when C3210 people greet me by telling me how tired I look. Why do people do that? Do they imagine it makes me feel better about myself? The other night I caught myself watching a 20 minute you tube video on how to apply eye make up to make you look more awake. Then I realised that, as it was 11.30pm, a better idea would probably be to stop watching you tube and go to sleep. My mum has never been a big make-up person. She doesn’t wear anything day to day and all she’s ever put on her face is Johnson’s baby lotion. Yet she’s 73 and doesn’t have any wrinkles. It’s the one advantage of having oily skin, she tells me. Well, I share that trait, so hopefully I will also be wrinkle free into my old age. Although really, what’s so wrong with wrinkles? We’re conditioned to fear them, but all they show is that you’ve lived and survived life. The only thing I remember about mum getting ready is her putting a bit of foundation and mascara on – and the hair tongs. She was forever putting her hair in a wave in the 80s because it’s dead straight. Of course now that’s the thing. My mum has had the same haircut the whole time pretty much -just above shoulder length. And if the hairdresser takes a millimetre more off it it’s like the world will end. I have definitely spent more money during the lockdown on beauty products – I guess partly because I’m not going out. But overall, compared with the average woman, I think I’m much less bothered about it. I would rarely spend more than £20 on any one item – in fact the only thing I’ve spent that much on is under-eye concealer. I don’t think a heavily made-up face is particularly attractive – the current make-up trends, with all the contouring and the heavy eyebrows – I think they look pretty grotesque. It’d look ridiculous on me. Now I’m working at home, all I wear makeup wise is some concealer, a little bit of blusher and some mascara. I’d say concealer and mascara are the two things I can’t leave the house without. The only reason I wear make-up when I’m WFH is because of all the video calls. I’ve not worn foundation for a long time. Generally I only wear it for a night out or if I’m going to work in London/at a client’s. The one thing I do love is nail varnish. I don’t often go to a nail-bar – partly because I’ve heard a lot of the people who work in them are trafficked and I don’t want to be part of that. Also because I can’t justify the expense and rarely have the time. I like doing my own nails though and usually go for pretty bright colours. It cheers me to see them. If I was on a desert island, I wouldn’t care about the make-up, as nobody could see me and I wouldn’t have to see the dark circles in the mirror. I have a tendency for dry skin, so I think I’d have to take moisturiser. I used to have short hair when I was at secondary school, then grew it out at uni. It got very long in my twenties but then in my thirties I started to think about cutting it again. Then, after I had my baby I realised I wasn’t going to have time to faff about with hair dryers and straightners, so I got it cut really short. I’ll never go back! I love it short and think it suits my face more. Being mum to a small person, I rarely get much time to get ready if I’m going out for the night (ha! What a dream. None of us have been out for months). So all I do is wash my face. Foundation, eyeshadow, quick eyeliner, bit of blusher then lipstick. I do like a red or bright pink lipstick if I’m going out. I think it can look quite funky with the short hair. Though I’m never sure if I carry it off. What the hell though, I like it."

Since lockdown the only places I have been are work (where I was the only one in my office and the only person who came nearer than 2 metres to me was the cleaner when he suddenly appeared behind me to empty the bin). I had also been to Lidl twice but the social distancing in there was excellent and if I saw anyone coming down the same aisle I moved. As neither my husband nor stepson caught it from me I have wondered if one of them was a carrier. Anyway, my stepson had just been handed back to his mother on Palm Sunday lunchtime, when at about 6pm I started coughing.  This carried on for about an hour and so I looked up the coronavirus symptoms and decided it was definitely a “new continuous cough” and we would need to isolate for 14 days. I asked S to ring his ex-wife as now that she'd taken A back from our flat they would need to isolate for 14 days too. Apparently she just said “Let me know what you want to do about next Sunday” (when we were due to have A back again) and when I said to S that she needed to isolate he said “I can't tell her what to do.” Within another hour I was all achy and couldn't find a comfortable position to sit in. I didn't want any wine (!!) or supper, and went to bed really early. The next day I was feeling worse – aching all over and incredibly tired, and still coughing. When I rang my team leader I explained about how A had just gone back to his mother and that she should be isolating and shouldn't be coming in to work today, and she said she would let our manager know and they could deal with it if she turned up. (She works in  next door to me).  The rest of that first week I felt absolutely awful. My husband continued to watch his car programmes and even went and got himself some lunch without asking if I wanted any!  (I didn't, which he later said he knew and that's why he didn't ask). I felt really unloved but it turned out later that was because he was worried he'd lose me! He insisted on going out every afternoon to look at the sea for his exercise. He has never been so keen on exercise since this lockdown! I didn't even feel like reading, which shows how ill I was. I just watched films – we went through a phase of ridiculous disaster films from the SyFy and Horror channels – 3 Headed Shark, 5 Headed Shark, various Apocalyptic/Doom titles. Some were so bad they were good, some were actually quite watchable and some were laughable, if I'd been in a laughing mood. I slept an awful lot. On Maundy Thursday, while watching an online church service, my cough got so bad I could feel it hurting my throat, and I started to worry my breathing would be affected and I'd have to go to hospital, but when I woke up on Good Friday the cough had got a lot better.  Through all this, I had such a strong sense that God was looking after me, and I was so grateful that S wasn't ill, although he was upsetting me with his apparent indifference. Luckily, his younger son T did a massive shop for us on the Saturday, as we had almost run out of everything. S's main concern was wine, and I think T went to 3 different places to get him stocked up for the next week until he could go out again. (It was a good job for S that I hadn't wanted to drink or eat anything much, or we would have run out sooner. S had tried to get an online shop, but there was nothing at any of 6 supermarkets for the next 3 weeks!) T came back on Easter Monday with a copy of the Times and a bottle of brandy for S's 70th birthday. T didn't come in either time – he stood at the bottom of the first lot of stairs and they talked outside. I was feeling a lot better by that day, and I did manage to eat some dinner and have some wine for the first time in over a week. I had thought about getting someone from work to deliver all the things I'd need so I could work from home, but on the Tuesday a huge fatigue and depression descended on me, and my team leader said she thought I ought to take the whole week off. I had been craving hob nobs towards the end of the first week, as something plain I could eat, and when it turned out T had bought chocolate ones it made me cry!! I lazed about most of that week, still not wanting to read. Then suddenly, at the end of the week I was watching the old version of “Swallows and Amazons” and I felt happy for the first time in ages. My team leader had found out that I needed to get an isolation note and she'd sent me the link to the NHS website to get it. I had to type in my symptoms and a warning came back saying “Phone 111 now – you have the virus”. Obviously by this point I knew I was on the mend, so I didn't ring anyone but just got the isolation note and sent it to work. My team leader wanted me to stay off longer, but by the Monday I knew I was ready to go back to work. I had been in our flat for 17 days and was sick to death of S's car and salvage programmes! S had been raring to go shopping again – and managed to buy a second pack of chocolate hobnobs instead of the plain ones I wanted! When I arrived at work and saw my desk I was so happy I said “Hello” to it. I had felt very supported by my team leader and managers and it was nice to speak to my colleagues who were working at home and hadn't been told I'd had the virus.  (S's ex-wife had come to work the whole time, and my manager had reported her to her manager but nothing had happened. She had offered to keep A for a 3rd week, so that was a bonus for me). I have gone through many emotions since lockdown – firstly I was cross because of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister closing all the churches. They weren't closed in the plague or the wars and have such a strong faith I was sure we would have been safe at church as long as we kept to the social distancing rules. People could have been allowed to choose whether or not they wanted to go. I was also deeply sad about my Mum being in lockdown in her care home, with no idea of how long it would be before we could see each other again, or even if we would (although my faith makes me sure that we will). Then, when I was ill, I was so depressed. A kind of euphoria then took over that I had survived the virus (without going to hospital, which is a huge fear for me, and without S catching it, which was an even bigger fear). Now I find I am fearful of coming into contact with other people, even though I am supposedly immune for a time. I have been appalled by the behaviour of some people in the office and today I was in Morrison's as Mum told me she needed some toiletries and I'm the only person who knows exactly what she needs, and I was shocked by so many customers (and some staff) not even trying to do social distancing. I felt like shouting at them, which is not like me at all! It made me feel really tearful, and when I got home I asked S if we could start online shopping because I am frightened of him going in there, but he said it's always all right when he's there. He seems to think I am mad when I get upset by the lack of social distancing, although he promises me he does it. (He refuses to go into isolation because he's had his 70th birthday as none of his health conditions are to do with lungs or breathing and he wasn't 70 when it started! Also that would mean I would have to work at home, and we only have one living room where the table is too high, the chairs are too low, and he wouldn't be able to watch telly or play on the wii with A while I was working. I wouldn't be able to bring my second computer screen home and I don't think I could do my job without it. (I use a lot of spreadsheets with documents/benefit claims on my other screen). I have found great pleasure in talking to some of my church friends – I have gravitated towards them rather than my atheist friends during this crisis – and listening to the birdsong outside, which is really beautiful. The Government I think the Government was too slow in locking everyone down, especially not stopping flights coming in and out and stopping people travelling about unnecessarily (including themselves, as several pages of today's Times talk about!) I know, from talking to people in other areas, and from what I have observed, that not everyone is following the guidelines, and yet Boris Johnson is always banging on about trusting the public to do what is right – I wouldn't trust the public at all! I would welcome police or appointed inspectors coming into my work and fining all the people who don't observe the rules. (S. says they are not rules as they haven't been made law! I have always been the butt of jokes in my family for wanting to abide by rules and not break them and it seems I still am – although my sister, who usually likes to break rules, has been abiding by them very well in East Barnet and gets shocked when she's out with the dog and sees people in crowds). I have no idea what steps they are going to take next, but the loosening of the lockdown has already meant that on the North Norfolk coast we have been inundated with second-home owners piling into our shops and crowding the beaches. S is upset he can't go and sit on his usual bench looking at the sea because so many of them are around. I think Boris Johnson's days are numbered and if he loosens the lockdown much more and the infection rate goes up he will be blamed – although people should take responsibility for themselves and have some common sense. News In the early days it got so depressing with all the figures I didn't want to listen to it every day, when the only thing you can really do is pray about it. (I was inspired when I read about George VI asking for a national day of prayer before the evacuation of Dunkirk, and look what the result was. No one has enough faith to try anything like this – especially with all the churches shut!) We are getting regular updates at work about any changes to guidelines, and S has a newsfeed on his 'phone so tells me anything major. I read the news in the Times every Saturday (we only get it on Saturdays and Bank Holidays for all the crosswords and sudokus). I certainly have no wish to watch the daily broadcast and am at work at that time anyway. I am surprised that a BSL interpreter is not used for the news coverage. I should have thought with all the technology available these days everyone should be able to access all the news they want. Work and home life I am still going into the office. I was so grateful when I found out that it would stay open for the duration as working at home would be a nightmare for me (and S!) Everyone was so terrified in the beginning we all got kitted out to work from home, including me. For the first time in about 6 years I have a telephone headset (far superior to everyone else's as the earmuffs cover my ears and sit properly over my head instead of only halfway up one side). When our 'phones were changed to work via computers I got a headset and training but I never needed to ring anyone as part of my job, so over the years my training was lost, and when I found my headset didn't even work no one cared (especially me, as I have never liked the 'phone).  But now it has opened up a whole new world, as I am missing my colleagues and managers and it is lovely to see one of their faces on my screen and all I have to do is click Accept and I am speaking to them.  It feels like a miracle to me. One of my colleagues still comes in two days a week, which is nice, apart from the fact that she has started bringing a radio in without headphones. Luckily my team leader popped in last Thursday and asked her to turn it off while we tackled a complicated problem, so I hope that might be the end of it. Another team leader has got so fed up with working at home that she has started coming in on the days when my other colleague isn't in (as their desks are next to each other so they couldn't be in at the same time). Someone came and took photos of the offices last week – I think they are trying to work out how many people could come back and still keep the distance. But I don't think many people want to come back now they have got into a routine. One of my friends came back last Monday but was so upset by the lack of Social Distancing in Council Tax that on Tuesday she bundled up all her stuff and went home again.  Luckily, she did report what she had seen (as I had already done a few weeks ago) so it adds weight to what I have said. There are 4 staff in there (including A's mother) and they stand right next to each other, hang over the back of each other's chairs to look at screens, barge past people in the loo or corridor (which is what happened to my friend N last week) and are extremely noisy, as if they are the only people in the building! Elsewhere there's a man who I saw holding a team meeting with 2 colleagues, chairs in a triangle and their knees almost touching! There's a big note in Reception by the signing in book asking us to use our own pens, and yet there are 2 pens sitting on the book which I've seen people use. I am so lucky to be employed by the council and especially to be working in what is deemed to be an “essential service”. I have no worries about pay and I still have structure to my day by going into the office and sitting at my desk in my nice comfy chair. I had been counting down to early retirement, but being off sick with the virus has changed my views – I'm now asking myself whatever was I thinking?!  I didn't realise a) how much I actually love my job and b) how much I love being in the office and c) how fond of most of my colleagues I am and how much I light up if one of them comes in unexpectedly or rings me up. As far as my home life goes, nothing much has changed as S insists on having A every other week. I was terrified the first time we had him here after he had been in his other home (where we know she doesn't abide by the rules) but now that I have survived the virus and S hasn't caught it I don't mind as I think he prefers being here and so I have been making an effort to play on the wii with him and cook him nice meals. (He managed 10 Yorkshire puddings last weekend!) S says that even though A is 23 his autism means he can switch houses regularly and who am I to deprive him of his son?  But if T does go on her 2 week holiday to Greece in June then she will be forced to isolate for 2 weeks when she comes back and we will be having A for 4 weeks – S told her this today when they did the changeover! I have noticed that S goes out even more than he did before. He loves finding things we need in the shops (he found a bag of plain flour in the Co-op on Saturday!) Again, I wish he didn't put himself in danger, but he is a grown man and he says as I am a key worker he is doing his bit! I am grateful he buys 2 Radio Times at our Post Office on a Tuesday and attaches one to my letter I write Mum every week and posts it first class to her – she usually gets it by Friday if her care home sort the post in time! I am getting more time at home as usually I would visit Mum after work every other day and her friend in another care home once a week, and not get home until getting on for 7. We have discovered the quiz show “Tenable” so are watching that every evening with our aperitif! But I am spending more time on the 'phone – I ring Mum every Sunday morning as that seems a good time for the care home to answer, and I ring her friend twice a week and my church friends every fortnight. Technology We have a work WhatsApp group and sometimes I have to turn the volume off if they are all having trouble connecting to the internet and my 'phone keeps beeping! My sister and I keep in touch on WhatsApp and she rings me every week while she's out with the dog if my nephew hasn't gone with her. (They are isolating together as his father's girlfriend has many health issues and my sister lives alone). A couple of my friends have asked me to speak to them on Face Time or Skype but I would hate that. I've never been much of a fan of 'phones anyway and would rather write letters, texts or emails. My sister has learnt very quickly (and while suffering from the virus!) how to teach all her pilates and exercise classes over Zoom. She has never been much good with technology but is now not only teaching all her classes but taking part in friends' classes and making her own videos which she can upload and sell! Because she has no expenses of driving or hiring halls or going to conventions where she spends lots of money on exercise clothes (and because she's not going out socially) she is saving lots of money, and will probably have a bigger profit this year! I am so proud of her as she would have been one of the last people I know to embrace technology – now she leaves me far behind as she has also been taking part in a friend's quizzes over the internet! Shopping and food I've already said about S's shopping habits.  We couldn't have done anonline shop at any point until a week or so ago when I saw we could have got one on for this Friday. Inthe beginning we only had the usual contents of our fridge and cupboards. A friend at work has a husband who is a chef and he had bought a lot of ingredients that were going to waste, so I bought a bag each of rice, pasta, flour and cheese from him.  We already had a 24 pack of loo rolls that S had bought on a normal shop. Wine was the hardest thing to get when some of the supermarkets rationed it to two bottles at a time, but S was very good at finding corner shops that sold 6 at a time and we were ok until I was ill and we were isolating. As I said, my youngest stepson helped us about that. I was appalled to hear one of my colleagues boasting that they had 189 loo rolls spread over their 3 bathrooms, and his mother had upped their normal weekly online shop so that she had 3 a week from different places! He was speaking to me a couple of weeks ago and said he was knocking off early as the latest online shop was due to arrive and he hadn't unpacked the last one! He did say they are now getting shopping for their 90 year old neighbours, who seem to mostly want wine, whisky and ice cream! I have done a bit more cooking – I've made some quiches and have cooked more when A is with us rather than relying on S. S has discovered how to make really excellent fajitas, so we've had them a few times when on our own. (A is “a meat eater” -his own words – and likes good plain food). We are definitely drinking more, which is not good as our wine habits were pretty bad anyway. I keep teling myself that when I have seen Mum again I will just completely stop, as sometimes I feel I'm just drinking to keep S company rather than for the pleasure of it. Entertainment and leisure I am so upset about all the theatres and cinemas being closed.  I am a weekly reader of The Stage, and the news of theatres going into liquidation fills me with horror.  I love our Theatre Royal in Norwich, and can't wait to go back there as soon as it's safe.  I can't bear the thought that we might lose it completely. I have missed 2 shows that I had booked, but luckily something stopped me making my next booking back in February. I've got a week's leave coming up in June and I'm going to take it so I can tackle some of the mess in this flat. We have books piled up everywhere and they need to be put on the shelves and there are so many other things that need cleaning or sorting and I never feel I have time for these jobs. I hear about so many people stuck at home and finding time to do various new things, but because I am still going out to work every day I don't have any chance to tackle our outstanding projects. I didn't feel like reading during my illness but have since read “The Three Musketeers” and have just ordered some books that were missing from my collection – I had the first 6 books of “A Dance to the Music of Time” but hadn't dared start them until I knew I had the last 6 – now I can start! I was also missing book 3 of a Melvyn Bragg series so hadn't dared to read the second (having read the first not knowing there were more). We are lucky as we have so many books in this house and many of them I've been meaning to get to for years! I have been listening to my set of Gilbert and Sullivan in my car as it uplifts me so much on my way to and from work. My other uplifting music is always Al Bowlly or George Formby and Mozart (which I'm listening to while writing this).  I don't want to hear anything depressing. I avoided “Normal People” on telly because my own late teens were not particularly happy and I don't want to be reminded of what I was like at that age!  I love “Killing Eve” and I binge-watched “Quiz on one afternoon when S had gone to look at the sea and fell asleep! We are still watching disaster films – is this because we need to see something worse than this virus? (I would not be a survivor in a disaster film – I would just be killed instantly. Life has been much kinder to me!) I am still watching “Neighbours” and was so upset when it got rationed to 2 episodes a week! Personal hygiene I am washing my hands much more often than before. And using the hand gel at work when I come back from making my tea. All the time I was ill I still forced myself to have a shower and get dressed every day (maybe not until 12ish some days). I have never been a laze around in pyjamas kind of person. I am still wearing my work clothes to work and my home clothes at home. (Our chief executive is wearing tee shirts at work!) I am shocked that S is making shirts last 2 days when he seems to be out more – he says he's not and no one will see him! We both take unironed clothes off the ironing pile (as it saves me work) if we are not going to be seeing anyone except each other! Sleep S has been staying up until 2 in the morning watching telly long after I've gone to bed, because he has been ill since December and had a dreadful rash which was so itchy he couldn't sleep. Thankfully he has got a lot better over the last 3 weeks since having to visit the doctor and getting a different cream at last. I have then had problems with him waking me up at 5 or 6 with his snoring. It's only a problem when I need to get up for work, and he has been better at coming to bed earlier and turning on to the side where he doesn't snore if I ask him nicely! We've both been having weird dreams – he got up from his afternoon rest yesterday saying his jigsaw of a Lancaster had fallen all over the floor. (He doesn't have a jigsaw on the go). I've had really vivid dreams with terror in them – aeroplanes flying at me through my window, people I love in trouble – but this could be because of the disaster films and because my Mum's home now has the virus (she's tested negative and is in her own room alone) and because I have always been a worrier.  I have found I am grinding my teeth a lot – it wakes me up sometimes. My dentist told me a couple of months ago it's a sign of stress and won't help my gums, so I am trying to stop it when I'm awake."

A healthy body means endeavouring, at my age, to keep fit with a healthy varied diet, with three meals a day, exercise like daily walks, weekly visits to the gym and swimming pool (this year of course these activities have not been open much of the time).My first experiences of health and wellbeing would have been over 70 years ago through my Mother cooking nourishing meals- not always easy just after WW2 with food shortages and rationing. Exercise was important then but as we didn't have a car in the family 70 years ago we all walked more, to school, shopping, We did cycle a lot but that is a good form of exercise; these last few years have seen cycling very popular again with many cycle lanes in our towns, and all roads where possible. We are often told today that our health problems, obesity , is due to lack of exercise and not eating the 'right' food, although I do realise finance comes into what food can be bought in some families, the most nutricous food may be more expensive, also could take longer to prepare and cook and in todays rather hectic lifestyle time can be important.I didn't really think much about health and wellbeing as a child, just accepting the food my Mother cooked, some of which would be called stodgy now! And plenty of walking/cycling exercise as mentioned. I am relatively fortunate as I do not 'put on' too much weight whatever I eat. I don't recall any advice about health at school - but that was in the late 1940's/1950's. We were too busy recovering from the war. We wouldn't have put weight on with sweets as they were still rationed.Key momentsMy Mother told me about having periods. I think she found it an embarrassing subject nearly 70 years ago. She gave me a book to read about adolescent subjects, and when my periods began at age 12 she just handed me products to use. I don't recall discussing bodily changes with my friends, but as mentioned things were not as 'openly discussed' as now. I just coped and accepted all the changes. I do remember having my first bra, but my Mother bought it.Of course as a teenager I did begin to think more about my appearance, what clothes I wore, make­ up, Most of my clothes as a small child were made by my Mother and Aunts, with occasional special outfits made by a dressmaker. I can still remember standing on a chair as our dressmaker - luckily a family friend who didn't charge too much, pinned dresses and skirts, and she also made my first petticoats. Everyone knitted, and I had many aunts who were not married and they knitted for my sister and myself. When I began work at age 15 and had a small wage I began to buy ready made clothes- one beautiful skirt by well known Gor-ray cost under £2. I have a photo of myself wearing it. I also went to the hairdresser more often once I began earning, a lovely experience then in your own individual cubicle. I also purchased face powder, lipstick, rouge and some eye shadow mostly from Boots where I stiJ) shop today..-2-Mass Observation -Autumn Directive (Cont'd) Part 2 : Everyday Health and WellbeingI don't think my parents, back in the 1940's/l 950's were too concerned with Fashion. My Father as a company secretary - white collar worker, had to wear a smart suit during the week and even at the weekends wouldn't have been seen with out a tie. I have old black and white photographs of my sister and I members of my family sitting on the beach in Cliftonville, my Grandmother has a smart hat and dress on, my Grandfather a suit and hat my Father does look to have an open top shirt and shorts, my sister and I have pretty dresses on, but we all look very happy! I do think back then we did all dress 'individuality' as many outfits were hand made, half the population looks the same thesedays. My parents did go to dinner/dances organised by my Father's company and again I have black & white photographs - my Father in a evening suit and my Mother in lovely, sometimes long, ballroom dresses. Even when I started work, at age 15, in an office, I was not allowed to wear trousers, but a smart blouse, jersey and skirt, no jeans and sloppy jumper. I still like to change when going out in the afternoon/evening - now retired I may have been doing housework, preparing a meal in the morning with an apron on.I do try and keep up-to-date with ways to keep a healthy lifestyle, medical advances, smart if not in high fashion, but mainly, in my late 70's, I hope my health will remain stable for a while yet. At the moment I'm waiting for the vaccine and sincerely hope next year life will begin to return to some sort of normality.."

It has been frustrating at times but there has been no choice. I was locked down from March 14th in Murcia Spain and it was difficult to return to the UK with our car and our dog as ferries weren’t running. Here’s a diary of this time 13.3.20 I am spending three months in the Murcia region of Spain with my husband. We have been watching the news about the threat of Covid-19 in U.K. and Spain but there has not been a sense of emergency about the spread to either country although we are distressed to see how Italy is badly hit by the virus. My cousin is arriving on a flight from the Newcastle UK to stay with us for a week and my sister and her husband are arriving on a flight from London later this evening. We plan a week of visiting local historic sights and beauty spots mixed with good food and meeting friends who live here. 21.00 As we are eating with my cousin in a local restaurant, we are told there will be a lockdown from midnight. This is the first we and our local friends have heard of the arrangement. My other two guests arrive to find out about the lockdown and we have a few days with three guests where we aren’t allowed out of the villa except for food shopping or medical reasons. Only one person is allowed out to shop and only to the local shop. We have our dog with us so one person can walk him with 50 metres of the villa. We are lucky to be in an enclosed villa with terraces and a pool because we are confined here with our guests for the foreseeable future. We enjoy outdoor lunches, reading by the pool and board games are pulled out at night. It’s years since we all played “trivial pursuit” and our general knowledge seems no better. 15th March -After a day or two, holiday makers are advised to return home as soon as possible and our guests leave early in fear of their previous flights being cancelled. My husband and I are on lockdown for longer because we have the car, the dog, the golf clubs and three months of holiday stuff to pack into the car to get theferry and our ferry can’t be changed. 20th March -24th April. We live in lockdown for weeks and our ferry at the end of April is cancelled. We manage to book another for the end of May and extend the rental of the villa for another month. 25th April – May We both feel safer in our little bubble of Spain with its strict lockdown rules than in the U.K. where the virus is spreading and the PM is desperately ill too. The U.K. guidelines were put in place two weeks after Spain’s lockdown and, to us, they seem lax. In Spanish shops there are 2 metre distancing markers, masks and gloves and sanitiser and there is a limit on certain items so there is not a shortage. On the news and from friends we see the U.K. is running out of toilet rolls of all things and hand wash. Didn’t we all wash our hands before this? People are stockpiling and U.K. shops are allowing it. We hear the key health workers get to the shops and they’re empty. Every evening at 8 there is music played and clapping from the roof terraces around is for the key workers in the crisis. There are not many people around us as they are mainly second homes and nobody can travel but we hear the music and applause from nearby streets and don’t feel alone. I come to Spain every February to write and enjoy warmer weather than in the U.K. but I find for the first four weeks that Ican’t settle to it. The world seems to have turned upside down and we listen to news for hours just waiting to hear something positive. Eventually we accept that this isn’t going away anytime soon and I start writing again. I write more than normal and finish my current book edits and write a novella too. The novella is about a diphtheria epidemic in a few Northern villages during the winter of 1944 and I empathise with the fear and helplessness of my characters as their children go to an isolation hospital. I discover through my research, that the ‘strangling angel’ of diphtheria was a real threat during the war years and killed more children than German bombs. The vaccine was eventually rolled out in the U.K. so by the end of the 40s this threat had been eradicated. I find myself wondering how long it will take to creat a vaccine for covid-19. My husband is 72 and I’m 68 so we both need medication and we are aware that our travel insurance has run out so it is a worrying time. The travel insurance people agree to extend cover for us and our car but we both need to access medication. Luckily, the local pharmacy orders our tablets without a prescription just on sight of the tablet boxes and we can pay for them ourselves. My tablets are aromatise inhibitors to deter cancer from reoccurring and we pay €92 for a month’s supply but feel grateful we have what we need and relax more about our extended Spanish lockdown. That is until we hear that our ferry has been cancelled for a second time. We decide that we cannot risk another booking and plan our route back through France and the channel tunnel. 11th May -Soon after the lockdown is partially lifted on 11th May, we make our minds up to leave and set off for home on 18th May. We must travel through Spain and France making three overnight stops and we are nervous at the thought of the journey but we want to get back to our own home and nearer to our children and grandchildren. We leave armed with masks, antibacterial wipes, our own sandwiches and a great deal of trepidation. We have 1600 miles to cover over four days before we reach our own front door and all three countries have suffered from the virus so nowhere seems safe. When we arrive home we will self isolate for 14 days and wait to see if we have managed to stay clear of the virus. 22.5.20 Home at last . 5.6.20 Our self imposed quarantine is over but we still can’t see our children or grandchildren. Thank goodness for technology. Govt. They’ve made mistakes but this is a new state of emergency and some of their actions have been excellent. Furlough pay, loans to businesses etc -good. PPE equipment -dire I think the govt is desperate to get the country back to work and the schools open but they have done an excellent job in scaring people into staying home. NEWS – I listen to the daily briefing from the govt. I take their data and latest updates with a pinch of salt. We didn’t know how ill the PM was until later. The Dominic Cummings debacle and the Prof Neil Ferguson breach of his own rules has been depressing. I listen to some BBC and SKY news. I ignore social media because there is always some sort of scare story circulating. BSL interpreters are the best response NS has made. We should have all acted as one nation for lockdown lifting and she has her own agenda. I’m retired from education but I write and do this at home. I’ve written more. Technology I’ve taken exercise classes with my own instructor in real time via zoom. Iaccessed classes in Spain so I had more access than if she had been teaching in my gym. I like not having to drive to a class. Time saving! I’ve spoken to friends and family regularly usingwhatsapp and facetime. I use facebook, twitter and instagram a lot already to promote my novels but ive been on it more. Shopping and Food We shopped in maskes in Spain and followed social distancing In UK we’ve used click and collect to miss out on the shhop exposure. I’ve bought clothes, toiletries and Books online We have started a HelloFresh delivery where the ingredients of three fresh meals are packaged with the recipe and delivered weekly. This is because I was bored with cooking the same old stuff and we get more variety. We used to eat out two or three times in the week. We haven’t used takeaways at all because im not sure how safe that is. Personal Hygeine We have both kept to the same routines. We dress and don’t have pyjama days like my grandkids do. We have both grown our hair over five months (no choice)and my husband has grown a beard but trims it. we havent gone feral. Sleep Terrible at first -Sleepless nights, weird dreams then exhausted and an early night but waking up at 3. I’d just get up and write. My worst vivid dream was that I’d told everyone Iwas fed up with living and I wanted to die. They all agreed and we went on a jaunt in a convoy of old cars to a dignitas place. I was in the car with my current and my ex husband and both were happy with my choice. I kept saying should I do it? and they both said yes you’ve had a good life. Myfriends and family came along in the cars for a sort of a wake rather than a funeral and a party was going on. I couldn’t tell them I’d changed my mind. Nobodywould listen. We were in a strange old house with no locks and I was frightened of sleeping in case I was injected. Iwoke up and didn’t want to go back to sleep in case it started again. I felt unwanted, invisible and surplus to requirements. Since we got to UK we have both slept much better. Relief at being home I tihnk."

Together 32. DOB 65 Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing The challenges of COVID-19 mean that in recent months, there has been a lot of reflection on health and wellbeing in unprecedented circumstances. But what about health and wellbeing in everyday life? 1.7.21 I’m writing this almost a year after the Directive came out because I seem to have stop getting the Directives to my email, and I didn’t chase up if they were still happening in the wake of the Covid hiatus earlier in 2020.  It is very interesting that coincidentally I’ve just finished reading a cross party report on Health, Wellbeing and the Arts, published in 2017, for work. A key arts organisation here is part of a Pan-Island governmental scheme under a Creativity and Wellbeing remit.  This reading was background homework to be able to facilitate this process and support that organisation.  I therefore have a much more focussed view of Health and Wellbeing than I would have last year or even last month! I notice a lot of interesting co-incidences like this in my life. We learn about health in many different ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? The fitness and energy to be able to fulfil work requirements, day-to-day tasks and stuff I want to do. What does “wellbeing” mean to you? Emotional health and the feeling of agency in life; to make decisions and to feel like I ‘count’ and am heard, scope to contribute and engage. This then aligns with the physical in terms of health. G4466, Female, Married, Orkney, PhD How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. I can only really engage with this in terms of my own self.  So for me to be healthy: . I need physical and mental capacity to do what I want to do, including ability to keep myself healthy . Resilience . Hope Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? Entirely. I would also add ability. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Health – from childhood Wellbeing – in the last 5 years or so and in the last year in a working context Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Parents Grandparents School GP Local hospital Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Home G4466, Female, Married, Orkney, PhD Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? School – Secondary Sex Ed – pretty much that is it There was no internet when I was a kid, or a young adult! Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? Not sure I identify with the construct of ritual here.  First bra was fun because it was new clothes, first period was an abject nuisance and continued on that way until I had a coil fitted in 2009.  The absence was fabulous.  Menopause is proving worse. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Yes – I run and do yoga and did regularly do Body Combat.  I’ve also trained in the performing arts so have danced and performed etc Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Yes – quite recently the combination of returning to F/T work and menopause has impacted on my ability to find time and energy to do exercise.  I suffer from onset Cluster Migraine and chronic fatigue.  Covid put paid to Body Combat. Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Government report most recently. BBC Newsfeed, The Guardian. G4466, Female, Married, Orkney, PhD Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? More, and that is saying something because I’m an utter hypochondriac! I hurt more and can do less. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? Not conceptually. On a personal level I suspect I will yo-yo between anxiety, depression and anger about the deterioration of it. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Not much No Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? No Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I like soap. I take Vit D and iron – so it would have to be those, without iron I would suffer from pernicious anaemia so would probably die on a Desert Island if boredom and a hatred of direct sun hadn’t already killed me. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Yeah, my Grandparents couldn’t leave the house without a wash and changing into better versions of the things they already were wearing!  I could never see the difference to be honest. Mum and Dad really scrubbed up to go to the Garden Party but wouldn’t for theatre, concerts or much for dinner parties. Dad used to put his work stuff in carrier bags – usually from boutiques I’d bought stuff from or M&S (where did they come from because we didn’t really shop there?) G4466, Female, Married, Orkney, PhD What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? Don’t do either much at the moment! Over the years this becomes less and less important, as long as I’m in layers so I can accommodate for heat and being cold – my temp fluctuates quite alarmingly. Comfort is the aim these days.  Comfort is essential.  Leggings feature quite a lot, tunics too."

She manages to run, cycle and kayak for fun, sometimes with her children and husband, and sometimes alone or with others. She does some voluntary work but isn’t afraid to say “no” if too much is asked of her. On the other hand, she’ll always jump into action if there’s a crisis.  She’s cheery and doesn’t worry too much about things. She’s fairly tall, leggy and slim; her face is jolie-laide and she wears uncompromisingly short straight hair and black-rimmed glasses, so not a conventional beauty, but confident. Identity I’m not conscious of my experience of health and wellbeing being influenced at all by my circumstances, except maybe being brought up in post-war Britain. I suppose I’ve always being conscious of my figure, and I still am. Growing up “Well-being” wasnever really a thing whenI wasgrowingup. “Health” would justbe about not eating rubbish (not that there was any on offer in our house) , not slobbing around all day (some chance!) and being told to sit up straight, or stand up straight. I’m not aware of any health education at all, except basic nutrition (what foods contain protein, carbohydrate etc.) in 1st year Domestic Science at grammar school, and basic sex education (just the mechanics of female reproductive system) in 1st year Science. Key moments There were two coming-of-age moments in the first years of grammar school -needing a bra, and starting periods. I was very jealous of girls who wore bras, or brassieres as Mum called them; she let me have one during 2nd year, in 1963 when I was 12, a cotton affair with circular stitching on the cups to enhance the minute contents. My periods started in 3rd year, in 1964 when I was 13, and there was great pride in parading down to the toilets at lunchtime with a sponge bag, coyly announcing “I’ve got to change something”. I had to buy my own sanitary towels on the way home from school, from a chemist by the bus stop, and carry them home in the plain brown paper bags Page 2 Everyday health & wellbeing H6675 F 69 married Kinghorn, Fife Former building society cashier they were always sold in. I suppose it was to be discreet. It wasn’t at all discreet. Neither was the method of disposal at home: I was given some old copies of the Evening Standard to keep in my bedroom drawer, and soiled towels were to be wrapped in a sheet of paper and then carried downstairs to be thrown on the living room fire.  I guess that’s what Mum had done when she was a girl. I remember her telling me that most of her sisters, and her mother, used washable rags, but she was much more fastidious and saved most of her Saturday-job money to buy sanitary towels. This was in the late 1930s. Another key moment in growing up was losing my virginity, when I was 19. By this time I was away from home and had no need, or wish, to confide in Mum. Her greatest fear seemed to be teenage pregnancy and the disgrace it would bring on the whole family; she would point out any local families blighted by this stigma. At university 1969-72, in my girls’ hall of residence, we pretty much knew who were the “girls who do” and the “girls who don’t”. Growing older You keep fit naturally when you’re younger, as you run around doing your life.  It’s relatively easy to keep that up when you get older, but you need to be more intentional about it. I started going to weekly Keep Fit classes just for fun when my children were small, and began going to a yoga class. In 1986 just to get an evening out.  Now yoga practice is essential to keep me supple. Feeding a family keepsyou concentrated on healthy food choices,andI’ve never gotout of thehabit.  I plan our meals on a meat/vegetarian/fish three-day rotation, and keep a record of what we have each day so that we don’t have the same main meal twice within any calendar month. After I suffered a complete physical collapse in 1993 and was subsequently diagnosed with ME/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which I still have, I have been aware of a decline in my physical and mental capacity so I have to be more deliberate in exercising both body and mind. It only works if you enjoy your chosen methods, which for me are yoga, walking, Scrabble, logic puzzles and piano-playing.  Covid-19 lockdown has provided the opportunity to walk an hour a day. I am as aware as ever of my physical appearance as we still sleep naked, and we have mirrored wardrobe doors so I have to look at myself frontways-on and sideways-on every morning as I walk around the room to get to my dressing-gown. Health, wellbeing and appearance “How are health and wellbeing related to external appearance?” you ask. If you feel well you look well, and you stand and move better. My yoga teacher A (79) has perfect posture and composure and always looks well because she moves well. “Have I been influenced by popular ideas of beauty or physical appearance?” Yes, of course; who hasn’t? This would apply particularly to hairstyles, I think: the Cilla Black back-combing/ fringe/kiss­curls of the 1960s, the Afro perms of the 1970s, the shorter-styled-but-still-permed look of the 1980s and 1990s, the short spiky cut of the 2000s, the short and spiky but with mad colours too in the 2010s. There is much more scope for individuality as you get older, because we grannies are comfortable in our own skins by now. Something I have discovered this very week (January 2021) is a setting on Zoom to enhance my appearance; my skin has never looked so smooth and dewy as it looks now when I am on screen talking to the family or to the rest of the Bible Study group! My parents had no opportunity or disposable income to be influenced by fashionable ideas at all. Page 3 Everyday health & wellbeing H6675 F 69 married Kinghorn, Fife Former building society cashier They were born in 1922 and 1925, so were teenagers in the 1930s and during the war. Health and beauty items I wouldn’t want to be without? It would be horrid not to have toothbrush and toothpaste, or lip balm. But I think the one Desert Island item would have to be all-purpose moisturising E45 cream -good for face, hands, body. Getting ready to leave the house I can’t remember any going-out rituals which Mum and Dad had on a daily basis. Dad would, on a Sunday night, clean his shoes, press his trousers and clean out the budgie’s cage. Every day, after cooking lunch, Mum would wash her face and put on a clean dress or blouse for the afternoon. Occasionally, if going out somewhere really posh like a dinner-dance, she would put on a very little face powder and lipstick. She used Lacto-Calamine lotion as a foundation, and no deodorant, just talcum powder. I have a mirror by both back and front doors, to check (and spike up) my hair and put on lipstick before I go out, although lipstick is less good with a facemask! In recent years, say since I was 50, I’ve used foundation, blusher, concealer and eyebrow pencil every day. When myhair isn’t salon-coloured, I’ve used hair crayons to addcolour -pink, purple, turquoise, blue -but Boots has discontinued the make I used to buy and I am making my last stub of pink last a very long time. Older skin needs some colour in the hair, or else if you’re grey like me then you just feel you are disappearing from the neck upwards. I have always painted my nails, toes and fingers, since I stopped biting my fingernails when I was 33."

I have used the headings you suggest, but have separated “work and home life” into “voluntary work” and “family life” which is more appropriate for me. Health Thursday Feb 13  Problem with my teeth:  to dentist who advised one crown initially, plus more work to follow  Tuesday March 10 Had crown .tted;  planned to return for more work to be done.  Ha!  Thursday 16 April  The .rst of 13 DIY .llings to try and hold my crumbling tooth together: the “emergency dental repair kit” from Boots online works .ne as long as you hold the bits of tooth together .rmly for about 5 minutes after “glueing”.Husband has done the dentistry: it would be impossible to do by yourself.He has also taken to tying up the entire tooth with dental .oss, like a parcel;  the dental .oss stays on until the next time we have to redo the .lling.  This is part of my anatomy I had hoped he would never have to see: the inside of somebody’s mouth is rarely a pretty sight. Wednesday July 15  Dentist reopened but not for any aerosol work, so I didn’t make an appointment. Tooth doesn’t hurt and I don’t want to have it exytracted;  I’d rather wait and see if we can save it.  Tuesday Feb 18  At last an appointment at the local hospital ENT department to remove earwax, which the practice nurse can no longer do. Very thankful for the appointment , where they “hoover” your ears, as I have been deaf since before Christmas.  Very apprehensive in the waiting room, which was crowded:  becoming aware that close contact with people is not ideal.  Friday March 13  Husband and I started taking our temperatures every day, as one of the signs of Covid 19 is a raised temperature. Saturday 25 July  News bulletins full of advice about obesity and how it is detrimental to health(no surprise there, then) and seems to be a factor in Covid 19 complications and deaths. Husband and I worked out our Body Mass Index - both happilyin the middle of the “normal” range. Thursday March 5  Started to go in and out of our front door instead of the back door, so that it’s easier to go straight into the cloakroom and wash our hands the minute we enter the house  Monday March 16  Daughter K phoned, tearful at the prospect of being stuck in the house for ever with her two-year old and small baby. Friday March 20 Reports herself “a bit emotional” Monday May 4  K was prescribed with anti-depressants to help her cope  Thursday March 19Sunday April 5  Daughter A reports herself “philosophical and positive”A reports her 9 year old daughter “moody and fearful”  Daughter J  Thursday March 19  Husband went to a blood donation session but didn’t stay as they all had to queue up in a small anteroom close together.  Monday March 23  Diary entry: “This feels like the start of a very long war, and all our instincts tell us to do what we can’t now do (getting together, meeting to pray etc).  I was dismayed at the thought of no weddings, and funerals to be attended only byimmediate family. Thursday March 26  Really concerned about this funeral business.  Decided to update our funeralplans in case none of the family can attend; sent them a document containing all our passwords, and reminders of where all our papers are, in the event of our deaths with none of them here, or with no time to tell them.  Friday March 27  Upset all day at the thought of not being at the bedside of a dying loved one;9 years ago this week since my mother died, and 3 years ago next week sincemy mother-in-law died.  Both of them were frail and in care homes, and were on “end-of-life” care for several days before they died, so we had enough time to hold their hands, tell them everything we’d meant to say before, sing to them and talk to them about the old days. The experience had been asgood as it could be, and it’s awful to think that not everyone can have that experience because of Covid 19. Friday April 10  Distressed at seeing mass graves in New York, and a .eld hospital in Central Park.  Tuesday April 7  Feeling guilty at secretly enjoying the freedom and “holiday feeling” of lockdown, when so many others are hard-pressed and distressed. Tuesday April 21  Diary entry: “Who will I be when this is over? Needing to rethink all social contact?!”  Wednesday May 13  Diary entry:”The .rst time I’ve felt miserable”. Felt tetchy and low all week, asthe realisation set in that this situation could go on and on. Monday 18 May Diary entry: “Concerned about sliding into unthinking torpor” Tuesday 19 May  Ridiculously thrilled to be in the church hall, tidying things up, emptying bins etc - all the tasks that would normally be a chore. Monday June 15  Decided on a “shake things up, make some plans” week. Husband and I decided that we would make scarecrows for the annual village competition;  we won last year and had previously decided not to do one this year so we didn’t feed our competitive spirit. Thursday 23 July  Loved this quote from the .lm “Marvellous”, watched this evening, starring Toby Jones and telling the story of Neil Baldwin of Stoke-on-Trent:  “I wanted to be happy, so I decided to be.”  Tuesday March 24  Husband’s hernia operation, scheduled for March 31st, postponed;  theyphoned. He was going to postpone anyway as he felt it not to be su.ciently urgent. Tuesday August 4  Hospital phoned: hernia op scheduled for August 20.  Need to self-isolate for a long fortnight beforehand, so immediately.  Decided to self-isolate together.  Rethought plans for shopping and meeting family.  Husband will be tested for Covid-19 at the hospital on August 8th, get the result on 19th and, if all is well, go in for day surgery on 20th.  Saturday April 18  A bout of cystitis; phoned NHS 111 and was amazed at swift and helpfulresponse when they must be so busy.  The extensive question-and-answersession about possible Covid 19 symptoms took longer than the rest of the phone consultation; prescription quickly sent through to local pharmacist and Husband picked up the meds later in the day.  Friday May 29  Phone appointment with locum GP about recurrent dizzy spells:  she thoughtit was probably BPPV, a sort of vertigo which is helped by a GP performing the Epley manoeuvre which is apparently some sort of head-waggling.  It’ll obviously have to wait until we can have hands-on consultations!  Tuesday June 16  News of friend E (93) in a care home:  no visitors for months, until she declined so rapidly that she was put on “end of life” care and her daughter was allowed in for daily visits. She perked up so much that she is now backto her old self, so her daughter isn’t allowed to visit!  Wednesday June 17  Friend M back on medication for anxiety and panic attacks  Tuesday June 2Thursday June 25Tuesday July 14Friday July 31Saturday August 1  Swam in the sea - chilly but lovely!  Thursday June 18  Had to measure Husband’s legs for new surgical stockings, a job the practice nurse would normally do  Personal hygiene Entertainment and leisure Saturday March 14  Decided to cancel eyebrow-waxing appointment with K at her salon, as she’d just returned from holiday in Spain where Covid 19 was rife.I have actually managed to pluck my eyebrows as much as is necessary; having discovered that grey/white hairs don’t show much,  I probably won’t go back to the salon at all, thus saving £8 every 4 weeks  Thursday March 19  Husband bought hair trimmers from Sainsbury’s:  a No. 8 leaves you with25mm of hair all over, which is not far di.erent from the short spiky style I have anyway. Wednesday April 8  Husband cut my hair, some with scissors and the rest with the trimmer.  Very impressed with the result - posted it so hairdresser could see it.  She was impressed too! Tuesday June 16  Husband cut my hair again; we’ve decided that nude hairdressing is the thing, so the bits of hair don’t stick in our clothes. Monday June 29 Nude hairdressing for both of us. Saturday July 11 More nude hairdressing. Tuesday July 21  Our hairdresser reopened for business, with appropriate precautions.  We didn’t feel the need to rush for appointments, as we were managing perfectly well by ourselves. I probably wouldn’t go back at all except I like the girl and want to give her the business.  Monday March 23  Beauty salon owner brought round ordered supplies of cosmetics and sun cream;  £238 well spent, I hope.  Saturday March 14and fortnightly thereafter  Repainted toenails multicoloured, like I always do, all year round. Repainted .nger nails.  Friday March 20 and daily thereafter  Started a daily walk for about an hour (much more than usual, just because we have previously been busy going to other places and doing other things)  Tuesday March 17 and daily thereafter  Making the most of having every evening together, decided to play 2 games of Scrabble which takes about an hour altogether.  Vastly improved our scores and vocabulary over time.  Wednesday March 18 and thereafter  Started listening to “The daily service”, on BBC Sounds, at lunchtime onweekdays: not much to talk about with Husband when we’ve been togetherall morning!  Friday August 7 Tuesday August 11  Signed up for Oxford Centre for Life-Writing’s “Life-writing for immeasurable events” Submitted .rst piece of writing. A good brain-exercise and the tasks are very varied (as well as being optional).  It has been a joy to have more time to do the things I’ve always done in a more hurried manner: cooking, baking, letter-writing.  I wrote longer letters, more frequently, to the family, often including pictures, or poems I’d read. Started reading poetry on the loo every morning. Watched primary school choir rehearsals, taken by Daughter A, on Vimeo. Carried on listening to “The Archers”; after the .nal pre-recorded episode on Friday 1 May, special lockdown episodes started, just Mon-Thurs each week, on Monday May 25. What else did I listen to? No real change from usual routine: Radio 4 Today Programme 0600-0900; PM 1700-1800, the Six o’clock news 1800-1830, The world tonight 2200-2245. Watched more TV than usual, because we were in every evening. Watched usually for an hour, a programme we’d previously recorded.  Caught up on things we’d had recorded for months: the Royal Institution Christmas lectures; documentaries about the workings of supermarkets; feature .lms; “Elizabeth is missing” starring the incomparable Glenda Jackson, who won a BAFTA for her performance of an elderly woman with Alzheimer’s (like my Mum)Enjoyed reruns of historical documentaries: Mary Beard on everyday life in Rome; Lucy Worsley on everything Tudor and victorian; Andrew Marr on post-war Britain; Michael Wood on the history of Kibworth, Leics, through the ages.Made the most of the Wimbledon fortnight with the BBC coverage of past matches.Alan Bennett’s Talking heads monologues, with new actors recreating the 1980s classics.Got into more detective series: Cardinal, set in Canada; Van Der Valk, set in the Netherlands; Wisting, set in Norway.Had time to immerse ourselves in drama series: Wolf Hall (repeat); Twin; Mrs America; Hidden; The nest; Flesh and blood; Devs; State of happiness; Line of duty Still waiting for an invitation to the neighbour’s hot tub, which is under a gazebo in the garden, festooned with fairy lights! Technology Wednesday March 18  Managed to get this Zoom thing working, having a conversation with H and M in the morning.In evening, had a Zoom call with all three daughters and oldest grandchild, laughing until we cried (with relief and joy?) at antics of granddaughter who knew how to change backgrounds, put up silly photos etc.  Sunday March 22  Husband ran his Bible Study group on Zoom 0900, having helped a couple of members (by phone) to set it up.1100 and 1900 Our .rst Church services on Zoom and Facebook.  Sunday March 22 Friday July 17  Started daily Zoom calls with all three daughters and their children, at 1630 for half an hour. Mutual decision to limit Zoom calls to weekdays, as the family are out and about more now at weekends  Wednesday March 25  Started running Bible Study group on Zoom:  8 out of 10 members happy towork that way.  It has been running weekly ever since, with me updating theother 2 by email after each session.  Monday April 6  Friend J (81) phoned to say she is learning new things on her tablet every day!  Monday April 13  Family quiz on Zoom in evening.  Thursday May 7 andFriday May 8  Joined new Facebook group with cousins to share memories and photos of our parents, who were 19 siblings  Friday May 29  Registered for online banking;  too slow to wait for them to answer the phones these days (20 minutes).  Wednesday June 3 and Thursday June 4  Enjoyed watching a few Aberdeen Festival of Music classes entered by our grandchildren, all entries being recorded then played to the audience on Zoom, with live adjudication  Saturday June 13  Daughter A put on a live Facebook concert of songs from the shows, with husband I as piano accompanist; part of a series.  Thursday July 9 andfortnightly thereafter  Our .rst Messy Church session on released on Facebook, Husband having learned how to use i-movie in order to make videos to upload to Facebook.  Friday July 17  Husband learned how to use GarageBand to upload songs for use in church services online, and how to make multi-track recordings of his singing  Friday August 7  Family concert on Zoom, organised by granddaughter A (11).  We all performed - instruments, dance, recitation, songs - including a video of grandchildren F and E (two and a half, nine months old) jingling bells while daughter K sang “Jingle bells”. Granddaughters A and L (11 and 9, living inBirmingham and Aberdeen) had choreographed and rehearsed a dance routine via Zoom.  Sleep No change in sleep patterns or dreaming, although I was waking earlier than usual during most of March, mulling over what was happening in the world. This is not helped by the fact that, to detract from tinnitus, I keep the bedside radio on all night, on BBC Radio 4/World Service. Shopping and food Monday March 16  Feeling that the world was about to close in on us, Husband and I had a tripinto town to look at lightweight vacuum cleaners in Curry’s;  I stocked up withtoiletries at Boots and Superdrug, and bought some costume jewellery (earrings) in Next.  Monday March 16  Visited the new Foodbank premises and took in some boxes of donations from our church.  Impressed to see they now have fridges and freezers so can stock a wider variety of food.  Thursday March 19  Husband to Sainsbury’s for weekly food shop.  Bought hair trimmers for DIYstyling.  Friday March 20  News bulletins all about panic buying of toilet rolls, pasta, .our…. and supermarkets setting aside special hours or days for di.erent special groups of customers to shop. Some rationing of supplies to ensure enough for everybody.  None of this a.ected us directly.  In truth, it’s quite exciting and makes you feel as though you’re playing at being in WW2;  we have plenty offood and supplies generally, and can easily manage with alternatives to the items in short supply.  Wednesday March 25  Much discussion, in our Zoom Bible Study group, about shortages, where to get sanitiser etc. Dismay that Boots aren’t letting you browse around the shop for toiletries or makeup.  Thursday March 26  Diary entry: “[Husband] to supermarket. He found no queues, and enough stu. on the shelves; bought treats for Aldi and Sainsbury’s sta. and, this afternoon, for chemist and Co-op sta. in Kinghorn” as a thank-you for all their extra work, and to compensate for all the abuse received from frantic customers  Monday April 6  Ventured to our local Post o.ce and chemist: limited customer access, with chalk marks on the pavement outside to space out queues; the chemist on restricted hours, and only admitting one customer at a time, with a one-way system around the shop, and a screen at the till.  Quite nerve-racking, tryingto think about every move you make.  Thursday May 21  Husband managed to buy two packs of vinyl gloves, some dried yeast AND 2bags of granary bread .our, none of which had been in stock for at least 2 months.  Tuesday June 30 Tuesday July 21  Ventured into Kirkcaldy, our nearest town.  Hardly anyone around in the high street or the shops.  Ventured into Holland & Barrett;  wore a mask for the .rst time. Second visit to Kirkcaldy; not so nerve-racking as all the shops andassistants are used to the new routines now.  Used contactless credit card payment for the .rst time. We have bought Safeky devices so we don’t have to touch door-handles or press buttons with our hands.  Friday July 11  Heard that L is to rent the empty shop unit in the high street, as a warehouse for her newly opened business in the next town, where she supplies goods in bulk, and customers take their own containers to .ll them. She started the business in November 2019 and has been busier than ever since lockdown started.  Saturday July 18  Used a cafe for the .rst time in months. Husband went in to order and collect, and we sat outside.  Tuesday August 4  Registered for Sainsbury’s online shopping as we have to self-isolate for two weeks before Husband’s op;  shopping this way is relatively easy and painless, so we might carry on like this for a while.  News I seemed to be glued to news bulletins even more than usual during the early weeks of the crisis, because events were moving so quickly both in UK and around the world. BBC Radio 4 programmes in the morning until 0900, then again at teatime 1700-1830, then at bedtime 2200 onwards;  BBC News channel on TV at 1300 and 1600. We started watching the live 1700 daily brie.ngs from London and did so for about a month, then there wasn’t so much day-to-day change . I’m afraid I started to think, “Oh, there can’t be much to say today” when a less senior member of government was put up as the main spokesperson. Questions from the assembled press, who were in the brie.ng room at the start, were pertinent; some of the repetition in the screened questions, and the standard answers, later on was tedious. We also sometimes watched the daily brie.ngs in Scotland; I think the sign language interpreter adds to the experience. I don’t know anyone personally who has had di.culty accessing information. Husband used information from BBC website to make his own graphs of infections and deaths in UK and in Scotland (and is still doing so August 2020)Husband signed up for The Times daily coronavirus update by email (and is still doing so August 2020) I make brief notes in my diary about major news stories of the day, so can trace the spread of the virus and concomitant interest, changing into alarm, developing into panic, leading to political action.

Mass-Observer H6804 describes themself as female; age 64; widowed; doctor and psychotherapist.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2: Health and well-being Female, 64, widowed, Blackheath London, doctor and psychotherapist. Number: H6804 Health, wellbeing and the healthy body The word health means to me able-bodied, energetic, everything working as it should. It also means mental health, although that is not what I immediately think of when I hear the word. The word well-being covers both mental and physical health, but health tends to refer to the body in my experience. I haven’t really thought about health in terms of energy before, but I realise that, for me, that is a very important part of feeling healthy. It may be that all my body parts are functioning normally, but if I feel lethargic, not wanting to do anything, that feels unhealthy and affects my well-being. Energy is so important in life and our ability to engage with it. When I think of a healthy body, these words come to mind: Fit, functioning, energetic, agile, fresh. Freshness is particularly important with older people and it often comes down to the colour of facial skin. Fresh healthy people have fresh healthy complexions, usually pink rather than the grey of less healthy people. Their faces are relaxed rather than tense, their eyes bright. It is more obvious in older people, as there are starker comparisons, but you can see it in children too. The child who is alert, energetic, bright-eyed, as opposed to the child who is grey-faced, slow, their body subdued. Identity As public health doctor I know a fair bit about how identity affects health. I am advantaged in health by being female and in an affluent class. That I have lived most of my life as a straight woman, in a respected profession, that I have had the requisite husband and children, and live in a nice house, that I do not have to worry about money. All these things support my health and well-being. As a widow, things are different. Although research consistently shows that single women and married men are the healthiest people in our society, loneliness is a big risk factor for health, and there are many more women who live alone than men. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing My mother was a nurse and she took her responsibility for our health quite seriously. She was one of the first mothers to make sure we had fluoride toothpaste, when the research was first coming out. She knew what to do when we were ill, and that gave me a sense of security. I don’t remember her talking much about diet or exercise – she didn’t exercise herself, outside the home, but was very active in the house and garden – but nobody did back then. She became a good cook over the years, having been ‘not able to boil an egg’ when we first moved to England from Malaya. In Malaya all the cooking was done by servants.  We didn’t really talk about health back then. Other than my mother always wanting my father to stop smoking. There were lots of rows about that. And when research came out to suggest that hair dye could be carcinogenic she stopped dying her hair overnight. So she was very concerned with health, and kept an eye out for new research and developments. I don’t remember learning about health at school. Key moments My first memory of puberty was noticing that it now hurt to sleep on my front, as my breast buds were tender. I remember thinking, oh, I’ll never be able to sleep on my front again. And I never did. I was late to menarche, I had my first period when I was fifteen, and my second a year later. By that time everyone I knew had ‘started’ so it was not a shock and was something of a relief. My mother always told us not to shave our legs, as it would just make the hair grow back thicker and stronger. That was not good advice! I had very hairy legs and was embarrassed by them. At one point my mother took me to have electrolysis instead of shaving. It was an act of real kindness, I know, especially as it was expensive and she worried all the time about money. It involved a needle going into each follicle to kill it. It was incredibly painful and it took an hour to clear a square inch. So that didn’t last long. There was one very painful memory, now I think about it. When I was sixteen we went on a touring holiday to France. I brought a friend with me. It was very hot and nobody had ever told me about deodorant. Some years later, my sister told me how my mother had laughed with her about how I smelt during that holiday. I was incredibly hurt. I couldn’t understand why she would just let me smell and laugh about it, rather than buy me some deodorant or help me in some other way. I think maybe it was because she didn’t really sweat and never used deodorant herself. I don’t know what people of her generation did about that. I don’t think my father used it either, but I don’t remember either of them smelling of fresh sweat. Growing older Being in the medical profession, and specialising in public health, I have been well-versed in the determinants of health. I have always had an eye out for my health, but have not always acted in the most healthy ways. I smoked for about ten years, during my twenties, cut down to five a day before my first pregnancy, and gave up during my second. I drank a lot in my twenties, first at medical school, where it was more or less mandatory (and very enjoyable) and then afterwards for several years. Again, I cut right back when I was about 30 and never drank that much again. It was when feeling rough from a night’s drinking was still evident on the second day that I thought, enough, I don’t want to feel this way. I have tended to take health advice with a pinch of salt and have preferred to live on the basis of ‘everything in moderation’ rather than making dramatic changes to my lifestyle. I’ve always taken a reasonable amount of exercise, walking and tennis mainly, and enjoyed that. I have tended to keep an eye on my weight over the years, cutting back if it goes up, treating myself more when I’m slim. I like food, but I don’t like feeling over-full, so I rarely overeat. My partner was not health conscious, and he did most of the cooking, so for many years I ate food that had a lot of salt and butter in it. But these days people think that the whole fat issue has been a major cause of the sugar issue, and the difference in healthiness between saturated and unsaturated fats has been challenged in recent years. I feel my moderate approach has been vindicated several times. As I get older I am more aware of my physical body, in particular the injuries and aches and pains. I do yoga now, and I have learnt to do muscle strengthening exercises to combat the reducing bulk of my muscles and reduce injuries. I have regular massages, which I first started having to treat injuries, but now view as essential maintenance. I have noticed that my skin and hair have become drier as I’ve aged and I have changed my hair products and I moisturise my skin regularly. I also use a serum and anti-aging face cream, something I never did when I was younger. Some years back I came across a school of thought about eyesight, that wearing glasses damages our eyesight, and I had had first-hand experience of that. I learnt that a combination of eye exercises and relaxation exercises could make a real difference to my eyesight. I no longer wear glasses. The aspect of my health I have invested most in, though, is my mental health. Having had a difficult up-bringing I have had a lot of psychological issues to deal with. Starting when I was about 40 I read a lot about psychology, I did some training in neurolinguistic programming and I became a career and workplace coach. About fifteen years ago I joined a spiritual school which has a strong psychological component and that has been revolutionary for me in my life. It is an ‘embodied’ approach, which means that you work through the problems that you have stored in your body as well as your mind. I would say that I am as mentally healthy as I’ve ever been now. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item?"

Below are some questions we would like you to think about. Health Please describe any physical or mental health issues you or anyone you live with have experienced during the lock-down period. Have you required any medical or professional help? If so, please tell us about this. How would describe your emotions in the last few weeks? Please start each part of your Directive reply on a new sheet of paper with your MO number, gender identity, age, marital status, the town or village where you live and your occupation or former occupation. Remember not to identify yourself or other people inadvertently within your reply. It is best to use initials instead of real names. I don’t think lockdown has had a particularly bad effect on my health, mental or physical. To begin with lockdown was a relief in many ways – everyone was in the same boat, all the bits of me that tell me what I should be doing fellsilent as I couldn’t doany of them. As a single olderwomanI felt more in the swim of things than I usually do and that was nice. I live in a small group of houses and we would see each other for socially distanced cups of tea sometimes. The Government What are your thoughts on the political decisions that have been made? Oh please! It has been a complete shambles! Every decision has been taken weeks after it should have been, the people in charge are so inexperienced and they look like frightened rabbits most of the time. I have no confidence that anyone really knows what they are doing. We have to wear masks in shops from Friday. This all started in March, why now for goodness sake? And it doesn’t improve – there is no sense of shame. Things go wrong, like going into lockdown too late, but nothing changes. We implement quarantine rules for people arriving in the country in June, when we should have done it in February. The logic is largely absent in these decisions and frankly I feel very insecure. Most people are make their own rules, based on their own judgment and assessment of risk. What steps do you think the British Government will make in the coming months? God knows. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? I watched C4 news for the first few weeks, and got headlines from the daily guardian email. I’ve also kept up with world statistics through a website. I haven’t watched the news forseveralweeks now and if I stumble across a radio interview with a minister I usually have to switch off, it’s so excruciating. Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. I did to begin with and it felt like a group of six formers were telling us what to do, people who looked completely out of their depth, including our prime minister. I stopped watching after a couple of weeks and just picked up the headlines afterwards. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I think BSL interpreters should be used. Or text perhaps. Work and home life Have you been working during the lockdown? Or maybe you have been furloughed? Please share your experiences. I am a psychotherapist and I have continued my work online. I am used to doing this anyway so the impact has been minimal. How has lockdown impacted your home life? Have you been home schooling children? Has it affected any relationships with people you live with? How have you managed these challenges? I did feel frightened to start with, being on my own and not seeing anyone. I continued to see one of my daughters, who lives locally and also lives alone. It felt that was ok because we weren’t connecting with anyone more than someone who lived with another. My other daughter came to stay for a month during May, which was lovely. I did tell her that I would like her to come. There was a sense of guilt I remember, about being safe at home whilst others put their lives in danger and were under terrible stress, and about having a safe income whilst others were losing theirs. I wrote this in my journal about a month into lockdown: ‘Some days, Imay be walking across the heath, or pottering at home, a sense of enormity comes over me. When the pandemic first started here, and organisations started to send people home to work, many of us stopped going to pubs and restaurants and shops, and then the official lockdown began on the 22 March 2020,mymindcouldn’ttakeitin.Ichangedmybehaviourradically,asdidmostothers,butsomehowIcouldn’t getmyhead roundit.That went onformaybethree orfourweeks, andgraduallyI startedtoadjust.’ I wrote this poem around May, several weeks into lockdown. Bewildered It is ok not to be ok, he says, as we berate ourselves for our good fortune. It’sall good,she says everything’sfine, andher eyesfill with achild’stears. The sun shines like summer, day after endless day, while they build porta-morgues in car parks, jump onpatients’ chestsin ICU, nurses cry and doctors set their jaws. We are good girls and boys, staying at home, keeping our distance, wearing our gloves and masks. We stand back on narrow paths and smile at each other. We know the drill. These others have toed the line as well, but now they go by train to cramped workplaces where two metres are the fabric of dreams My young neighbour predicts the weather for energy traders and is buying a three million pound house down the road, while I keep paying into the food bank, also down the road. Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? I was lucky to be used to connecting with people online and used to zoom, skype, facetime etc. I did join an evening class which was on outlook Teams, and it was so awful I withdrew from the course. But on the whole I’ve been fine. I have noticed quite a lot of people my age struggling though, having to update their laptops, struggling with understanding how to use the technology. I have a client who has never managed to sort hers and we now meet outside and go for a socially-distanced walk instead. Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? I’ve found that people have got in touch who I haven’t heard from for some time. It is as though we have more space to think and to consider who and what we value in life. I have also dated online! I quite liked it as it is easier and so reduces the pressure of initial dates. Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I rarely use these at any time and this has not changed during lockdown. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? To begin with I didn’t want to go into shops, and it was more or less impossible to get groceries online or delivered for quite some time. So neighbours and friends cooperated with each other, if I managed to get a click and collect shop I would get things for others and vice versa. I also started to order meals from Hello Fresh, a company that delivers the wherewithal to cook meals – the recipes and ingredients all arrive in a box on your doorstep. That has been really useful for a while. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I’ve been doing quite a lot of online classes, most of which I was already doing in person. Yoga, watercolours and poetry writing. I also have meetings with my spiritual group and have done a whole week’s retreat online in April. It worked fine. In fact I rather liked being at home and the autonomy it gave me. I could turn my video off and go and make a cup of tea while still listening! I could mute people I didn’t want to listen to. A whole new world. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? Probalby has not changed, but I do notice I’m less concerned about how I look and how I dress. I just can’t be bothered, and when I did some online dating it felt like a real stretch to think of something nice to wear. And then another outfit for the next date! Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. Yes I had a lot of strange dreams to start with, but these eased after a few weeks and I sleep fine now.

What does 'wellbeing' mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine 'a healthy body'? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person.To me health is your physical condition and its resilience to external factors.A healthy body is one where it is sufficiently nourished to be able to function and do what its owner commands. That doesn't mean it has to be in the peak of fitness but instead operate in the 'Goldilocks' zone of being fit enough to do physical work yet not overly so that you're a pile of muscles and at the other extreme you don't need to have ribs showing either.As for wellbeing; that is the internal comfort or happiness that provides you with a calm mind. So you are free from stress and worry that could impact on the way you view the world.First five words TonedAthletic FitSlimBare (i.e. exposed - as in beachwear)As for a person... the only image that comes to mind is the final image in the evolution of man. Someone who isn't overweight or overly developed.Failing that Charles Atlas and only cause of the image of him holding the globe springs to mind and not because he was healthy.IdentityHow do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all?An odd question.Yes social class would have had a bearing (both positive and negative) but I don't believe any of the other qualifiers had any influence on me at all.Everything I have done has been done by my taking part. Sometime the origin of any ideas may have appeared from others but the onus has always been upon me.Growing up and learning about health and wellbeingWhen and where did you first become aware of 'health' or of 'wel/being'?Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wel/being when you were younger?Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place?Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways - from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example?I suppose that the main person responsible for my health was my mother. I was always cared for and mum would worry if anything untoward occurred. I believe that this and her mental health issues meant that I kept away from mentioning anything as I didn't want to cause a reaction; not that mum was violent but Mum could cause a scene and could provoke a response from others if triggered.The only time I can recall the broader topic of health being broached at home was when the AIDS (don't die of ignorance) leaflet appeared through the door. My mum said I should read it and that was that.We had PE (Physical Education) at school and there must have been a health section at some point or it could have been part of this strange series of lessons where you either baked or did hairdressing; generally it was differing actives each week.Other than that I can't think of any interest in health and wellbeing. I know that in the last 10 years I finally managed to learn to swim. Something that I lacked and could be described as an apathy or possibly the lack of opportunity once the compulsory school swim lessons had ended. Apart from gaining a skill I had hoped that regular exercise like this would do me good. So that was me thinking about health - it was a natural progression from activity to an outcome rather than the other way around.Key momentsAs an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men?These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example?How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you?I have tried to remember this and I cannot. I can recall the acne and attempts to control it and the hours spent in the bathroom continually removing contaminants from my skin and trying to keep it grease/oil free.As for shaving I think I initially used either my brothers or my dad's stuff in the bathroom. I think I may have used a lathered up bathing soap before using my brothers shaving foam as I didn't want to reveal any trace of what I was doing. I was left to my own devices fornearly everything so they became things I had to improvise around as I didn't want to draw attention. Life was taxing enough with my mum having mental health issues and constant walking on eggshells so as not to initiate any manifestation of it. This does seem odd when written but it was the unusual landscape I was in and I understood that.Growing olderThroughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life?Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now?Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change?I commuted for a long time and because of the distance from the train station I used to walk a lot. Even after I had left home I went round nearly every night so the mileage was maintained.Now I seldom walk that way and now where I work is just 6 minutes' away on foot.I try to make up for this by walking into town to shop and by not using a car this has turned one expedition into several visits. This is quite noticeable in the number of shoes I used to get through. I usually wore out a pair in 2-3 months with the walking I did. Now they last longer.My only vice is my sweet tooth and I've gained a strong liking for Mars Bars. I have now tried to have less sugar in my drinks. Since we changed the location of the office just before Christmas we had to downsize a lot. A box of 1000 sugar sachets was abandoned and I took that home - I can confirm that the amount in one sachet is less than one teaspoon so my hot drinks are nowhere near as sweet.Health, wellbeing and appearanceIn your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance?Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way?Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn't live without? What would be your Desert Island item?I have never been overly vain. Yes I don't want to look 'out of place' but I also had no inclination to look attractive. Some people can wear anything and it looks great. I have a layout that doesn't lend itself to any particular style.My father used to go to the local working man's club at the weekend (usually the Friday and Saturday). He always turned out smart in a clean shirt and freshly shaved.With my mother illness she never really tried with her appearance. I can recall once to my surprise whilst I was very young her wearing lipstick. It was so out of character and usually was a sign that a schizophrenic episode was near.As for a desert Island item; I would say a toothbrush as I'm always dealing with plaque issues (and I may cheat here my saying tooth cleaning equipment as flossing seems to feature). But that selection is health based so I would also say a flannel as it makes for short work when washing.Getting ready to leave the houseDo you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time?I've tried to recall this. My mother due to her health issues stayed at home. My father invariably left for work during my early years and had retired whilst I was still at school.I do recall him going out to collect football coupons in the evening (Wednesdays to Fridays). A waterproof mac and a helmet and a bag was needed as he went off on his scooter.Often he would return dripping wet as it had rained heavily. The water running down his face and dripping from the lip of the helmet.As mentioned earlier my dad did go to a local working men's club. He was a small man and very lean. Something he didn't have to work at. This meant he was always a bit 'dapper' in his appearance (shirt/tie). There was always a smell (scent?) in the air when he got ready but I can't think of what it was. It could have been a soap smell from shaving but it was always there when he got ready.My routine is partly designed so as not to forget things.So after raising and washing etc. I dress with all my pocket items on the bed. Crucially this has to be coupled with a routine for my return from work in order for these things to be in the right place for the following day. The tricky one is my lanyard that has to end up beside the bed - it's not fun having to return back when half way to the office because you had left without it.I did once talk with a work colleague about routines and preparing for an evening out. I referred to them as the three S's which I confirmed stood for sh*t, shave and shower. Something she had correctly guessed. She on the other hand told me that she had the similar abbreviation known as the three F's. This I was told stood for face, fingers and f*nny."

I’m working from home and the work PC is on an old computer desk so giving me a 2foot space to work in. I’m find the day to day routine samey and very tiring. Others on the street were furloughed and spent their time gardening leaving mine looking dreadful in comparison (it was never going to win awards anyway). I get nearly weekly briefings from the office manager as conference calls. Notably last week was mental health week and we didn’t get a briefing – which is quite ironic. I have thought more about mortality and the loss of my parents. This sometimes affects me but I try to move on as there’s little I can do about anything. It doesn’t help that I’m totally alone here and often the only other face I see is my own reflection in the bathroom mirror. I’m very conscious of mindfulness. I responded to an artist friend online who was finding the day to day existence troubling. I replied that initially we all tried to maintain a form of normality but as time went by the ‘new normal’ takes over. It all becomes very beige and timeless (especially if you’re by yourself). So in order to be conscious of the moment and less inside your head we need to do small things in order to experience the present more. Little things like consciously noticing the texture of the chair as I raise or lower myself helps to focus the mind to the present. The Government I think it is easy to demonise people and I’m conscious that the Government gets criticism that’s underserved along with some that isn’t. I do believe that there was indecision at the start but from then on they’ve tried their best in the face of ever changing advice. Some of the plans take time to gestate but it is obvious to me that there has been a lot of thought gone into moving the population in the new future. Not everything will work out but all angles are being covered just in case (and we would complain if they weren’t). Some will argue that we are not being told but I believe we are being slowly manoeuvred because the population at large is unable to process more than one message at a time (there is a lot of stupid people out there). This coupled with the way the initial instruction was hammered home means there is a reluctance by some to move forward. We were asked to stay at home to ‘flatten the curve’; not to hide away forever. News Through what forms of media are you reading and/or hearing news of latest developments? Have you been watching the daily Government press broadcasts at 5pm? If yes, please tell us what your thoughts and experiences of this have been like. Have you or anyone you know experienced challenges with access to the news? There is a petition underway to the UK Government and Parliament to include a British Sign Language Interpreter in these briefings. BSL interpreters are used for Nicola Sturgeons briefings in Scotland. What do you think about this? I used to watch the daily briefings but I now just get the headlines from the BBC (preferably the Red Button service) or from other news services via YouTube. From the very start this was obviously going to take a year at least and any prediction of otherwise was based on an unsubstantiated hope and it didn’t take long before desperation for a news story by the media resulted in the reporting becoming a game of finding an ‘angle’ in which to spread despair. So instead of imparting information without bias it became criticism and rumour. One incident I did find annoying, we had “top” political journalists (Robert Preston and Laura Kuenssberg) asking questions they knew could not be answered due to the ministerial code. But because they wanted the headline they went and asked them. So they decided NOT to ask useful questions about the governments’ approach to the virus or anything constructive and insightful. I cannot recall the order of the questioners but even more criticism should be aimed at who asked second after learning that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. The act of repeating the same question/approach demonstrated that they wanted glory and a possible award nomination later. As for the BSL interpreter. I acknowledge that this group of people need to have access to the news but I suspect that the inclusion of one will slow the proceedings of the Q&A and raises accuracy issues from live signing. A BSL overlay is on the BBC News feed and on the BBC YouTube channel and is uploaded directly afterwards. There are also written reports online and the RED Button service (whose termination of service was postponed) does by nature provide written content. The inclusion of a BSL interpreter by Nicola Sturgeon is no surprise as it became obvious that she was playing a media game. All accessibility angles are covered and by also having her press conferences earlier than the daily one allowed her to reveal the contents of the COBRA meeting she was part of first. Work and home life Our office was disbanded to work from home and I’ve been doing this the 24th March. Some of the testing and construction staff have been furloughed. Since I work in a design office we are able to operate outside of the office but it has made things very awkward. We have to book a time slot to enter the office to collect any printing which thanks to our network security requires you to physically enter to present your ID to the printer. The Network speed has been volatile and it took a while to get the headsets for Skype meetings to work properly (and not everyone has been successful). I’m now working in a 2foot wide space and use the stairs as a filing system with paperwork all over the floor. There is now no separation between home and work as the PC and other materials are in the living room with me. My partner has been asked to shield and since the house is small she has gone to her parents were they have plenty of space. As a consequence I’m all alone here and it is lonely. Initially it felt like she was in another room but now it simply feels empty. Anything I put down never moves making everything seem frozen. A sort of timelessness invades everywhere. I had hoped to do something more for myself as I’m allegedly gaining by working from home. Instead I’m spending longer on the work PC due to its lack of speed and an unspoken pressure of being ‘seen’ to be online. I’ve now consciously decided to scale this back and I’m only recording (not claiming) an additional ½ ­1 hour extra a day. Mostly because I feel that any of my efforts are not being appreciated and I have noted snide remarks by a work colleague who wants to raise their profile. Since I’m working on his scheme I’m not going out of my anymore to accommodate him. No extra books have been read or any useful DIY jobs undertaken. I do have a boiler service due that will necessitate the rearrangement of the stuff brought from work – the joy never ends… Technology Many people have been learning to use new forms of technology during the crisis. What has your experience been of this? Have you been keeping in touch with friends, family and/or work colleagues with tools such as FaceTime, Zoom, HouseParty or WhatsApp? If so, what has this been like? Have you re-connected with people or have you found this a challenge or a pressure? Have you been using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date or escape from the events? I use Facebook but seldom interact with it as the platforms I view it on are fairly uncooperative. The version on my mobile is more of a random news post generator as it refreshes the page after every interaction. Also I definitely agree with the well-known conclusion that opinions are like assholes; everybody has one (and there’s a lot of people on social media). As for Zoom, I investigated it and found the site to be confusing as it is aimed primarily for corporate use. However a society I assist with at their events have paid for a membership and we all joined in for a group watch and quiz. A second get together then followed and worked quite well as we discovered more features. Shopping and food What have been your experiences of buying groceries either in shops or online? Have you experienced any challenges? Have your eating/cooking habits changed or stayed the same? In the early days it was quite mad. Since my partner was also here (before relocating to her retired parents as they had a spare bedroom with bathroom to make shielding easier) I ensured that we had a couple of weeks of basics on hand and since I had access to the warehouse at work I brought home a few of the cubicle style toilet rolls (we have hundreds of them). Since then it has calmed down a lot and I go in the evenings. Now the issue is clothes (socks/shoes) due to the limited supermarket options (I bet Asda wished they didn’t have George as a separate store) and WHSmith who has such short opening hours it is beyond ridiculous. As a consequence I have decided to subscribe to the two magazines I usually purchase. I had contemplated doing this previously when I had a run in with a WHSmiths supervisor who had publically accosted me and suggested (falsely) I was taking their stock without payment and when corrected didn’t assist me with the problem I was there for. So this was the decider. The other problem is collecting my partner’s prescriptions. They will not deliver despite having a poster for the service in the window and advertising it online. Also the carers that the Government recruited have never contacted us once. We got a letter with identification instructions but there has been no telephone calls and hence no support of any kind. As for diet; I was pretty good at the beginning but as time passed I feel into poor habits that I’m trying to address. I also had not exercised as much I should lately but I have compensated slightly by gardening. I have an unruly garden and due to the amount of trees it’s more akin to forestry work. Entertainment and Leisure We would like you to share your experiences of how you have been entertaining yourselves. Have you taken up any hobbies, learnt new skills or games, or increased your exercise? Maybe you have completed some DIY jobs? We would also like to hear what you have been watching, listening to and/or reading. I had increased my time in the garden but lately scaled back due to the very hot weather (I’m fair skinned and much prefer a cooler climate). I’m still slightly annoyed that the neighbours who have been furloughed could achieve far more whilst I was stuck working from home. I actually spend less time on things I used to do before because I have to do more things and because I have to nursemaid my brother through all his admins issues most nights. I have also failed to watch any of the backlog of films I own but I have watched a huge amount of YouTube across a wide number of topics. Personal hygiene We are interested to know whether your habits of personal hygiene have changed in recent months. Has the regularity of your washing, shaving, personal care been any different since the period of lock-down? If so in what way and how do you feel about this? I have tried to increase the frequency of my teeth brushing. Something I wanted to do and since dentists were closed it seemed a good idea. I still maintain the same general hygiene standards I have always done (with additional handwashing). One thing I had been doing is a fungal treatment for a toe. I try to shave more often as it makes the whole process easier. I have a body hair trimmer and I have used it to tidy up areas around the ears and around my neck. I did try to trim my hair above my ears as well but it was obviously not going to work as described so I abandoned that idea. Sleep There have been many reports of people experiencing insomnia and nightmares in recent weeks. We would like to hear about your sleep and those of your family or people that you live with. If you have experienced difficulties, what have you been doing to help relieve this? Have you had any interesting dreams? Please describe. This is one area where things could improve. As already mentioned it’s all becoming very timeless at home. Sometimes (well often) I can fall asleep on the sofa and wake in the early hours (the latest/earliest being 5am). I do have some drinking chocolate that I have at night but it doesn’t have any different result from the coffee I would normally have (I never get any ‘buzz’ from coffee). My sleeping hours seem to have shifted resulting in my later waking which obviously moves everything along as a consequence. I’ve had a few strange dreams but nothing directly related to current events. Sometimes I dream about my parents (my mother passed away a year ago)."

Wellbeing for me means that my mind is in good order and I feel good about myself and what I am doing in life. The first 5 words that come to mind when thinking about a healthy body are: Slim Trim Strong Fit Alive I don’t have anyone in mind when I think of these words but I do think of a sort of holistic vision of the countryside where a healthy unpolluted environment means healthy people. Identity I don’t think my idea of health and wellbeing have been influenced by any of the aspects you mention. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I probably became more aware of it in my 30s (in the 1980s) when there seemed to be a plethora of fitness/aerobics video tapes and the ‘Green Goddess’ on tv. I’ve always been fairly active, walking, horse riding, cycling, swimming so I didn’t really give it much thought. My parents didn’t talk about it.  There was no need to we didn’t have a car, you had to walk, cycle or catch a bus to get anywhere and we did a lot of that. M-OL6762 Female 64, Married Walkern, Library Manager I think we were taught basic health and hygiene in biology class and domestic science.  That was pretty much it. There have always been magazines and books on healthand fitness and diet.  A Lot of it is common sense.  I chose not to smoke, I stopped taking sugar in my tea about 40 years ago. I try and eat a balanced diet and get some exercise. I’ve never obsessed about my weight or how I look but I know it is a problem for some people. Key Moments I vaguely noticed that I was growing hair where there wasn’t any before.  I thought I was abnormal and kept quiet about it hoping that it might go away.  I can’t remember being too fussed or anxious about it. I was 10 when I had my first period out of the blue.  I hadn’t a clue what that was all about. My mum didn’t explain it to me. I remember her talking to my dad about it and it felt like I had been excluded from some big secret.  That was a shock to the system but I don’t think it really impaired me in any way.  I was just very innocent. I just got on with it. Girls in my class at junior school seemed to know far more about it than me but I wasn’t really interested. Growing older I’ve always done some exercise at some point throughout my life.  I’m not great at doing exercise for exercise sake so I incorporate it into my day e.g. cycling from work, walking somewhere instead of cycling or taking a bus or car. I’m aware that I have put on weight since I hit the menopause.  Nobody tells you but it is almost like you’re ok one day and the next, someone comes and rams a great big tyre of belly fat around your waist. Getting rid of that is my next challenge.  More cycling for me, I think. I think you definitely need to get fitter and stronger as you get older.  You need to be able to support your body weight with your arms. I would like to fit into my clothes more comfortably and look a bit smarter but apart from that I haven’t really been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance.  I’ve never been a beauty and I’m grateful for that.  It must be so hard for someone who was stunning when they were younger to get older and less attractive.  Anyway, I think there is more to beauty than meet the eye.  I think a beautiful soul is more important than a beautiful face. I use cheap and cheerful face and body creams that’s all. Baby oil is probably my favourite. Nothing fancy or expensive. It’s all snake oil anyhow. I just use the creams and oils to moisturise my skin rather than to achieve some miracle of beauty. M-OL6762 Female 64, Married Walkern, Library Manager My parents weren’t well off enough to bother about being beautiful. My mum was beautiful when she was younger and pretty when she was an old lady. She always wore makeup and wore it well but she wasn’t obsessed. She would always‘put her face on’ before going out but that is what her generation did. I could never be bothered with loading up with lots of make-up.  I’m far too lazy and it doesn’t suit me anyway.  I’m like my mum in many ways but that is where we differ. Getting ready to leave the house When I was very small my mum’s ritual was to make the ‘snappin’ (sandwiches) for my dad and my brothers who were at work.  She used to make the sandwiches and wrap them in the waxed paper that loaves of bread used to be wrapped in.  The wrappings would always be saved for the ‘snappin’. When I was older, my mum qualified to become a teacher. When she was teaching she would always have Weetabix for breakfast.  Her ritual was to put boiling water on the cereal and then milk and sugar.  It gives off an awful smell which I used to hate.  Getting ready for work was always a rush with everything last minute and nothing prepared in advance..  She always found time to ‘put her face on’ though.  Shealways used to say ‘little dabs of powder, little pots of paint, help a little lady, look like what she ain’t’. Like mother , like daughter.  I don’t prepare in advance. I’m not quite so disorganised but it is always a rush to get lunch prepared for work and get washed and dressed and out.  I hate working to a timetable set by other people so I’ve been rebelling against this from school days and throughout my working life.  Tea, talk, breakfast, out of the bathroom by 8.30am in the car by 8.45 to arrive at work by 8.55am for a 9am start.  It hasn’t really changed much over the years. When I worked in London, I did pretty much the same but much earlier so as to get the train for 7.30. I sometimes put on a bit of mascara but that is all. We don’t socialise much so I don’t have a routine for that."

MASS OBS NUMBER 3412; FEMALE; 61; MARRIED; RETIRED TEACHER; MONPAZIER, FRANCE. Five words which come to mind to describe a ‘healthy body’: fit; energetic; glowing; strong; happy. A particular person that comes to mind would be N, one of my sons in law. He is tall, broad and good looking (not to do with his health, just the way he is!) He used to play rugby pro­fessionally, until a shoulder injury stopped him. He still plays touch rugby on a weekly ba­sis. He works hard at maintaining his health and fitness -doing regular work-outs, going for runs several times a week, competing in the Elephant Epic -a gruelling cycle race held an­nually near Lusaka. He obviously enjoys being fit and healthy -both he and my daughter take their health very seriously, in terms of exercise and a good diet, but not to a point of obsessiveness.As a couple they are an excellent example of people happy with their bodies and way of life and I admire them immensely. I have to say at this point that I have a problem with the word ”wellbeing”. What does it ac­tually mean, apart from being healthy? After all, if you split and reverse it to ”beingwell” then it amounts to the same thing. In terms of whether my health and wellbeing has been influenced by my gender, ethnicity etc ….it’s not something I have ever considered. Does being a white, middle class female have a bearing? I guess it must, or you wouldn’t have posed the question. I imagine it has more immediate, or tangible relevance if your origins follow a severe, or specific regime or traditions. My background meant that, growing up, although we hadn’t a lot of money, there was enough to ensure we had a healthy diet; in addition, my brothers were diagnosed as coeliac at the age of 18 months and the doctors advised my mother that it would be easier (and avoid any risk to them) if we were all brought up on a gluten free diet. Just as well, as I have since also been diagnosed as a coeliac. As, 60 years ago, there wasn’t the range of gluten free products available that there is now, we didn’t have much in the way of cakes, biscuits, sponge puddings, pies and tarts. Our diet was pretty healthy -lots of fresh fruit and vegeta­bles, cheese and meat, milk puddings, but no processed foods. We were also strictly limited to sixpence a week to spend on sweets. M3412 My parents had responsibility for our health when I was younger; not only in terms of what we ate, but also exercise. My father was a very keen cyclist and I loved bike rides with him around the Surrey countryside. He would also go off by himself on his bike and discover places for us all to go to for walks -The Devil’s Punchbowl, Hurt Wood, Blackheath. We loved climbing trees, scrambling over rocks on holidays to Cornwall and Wales, swimming in rivers and the sea. I can still hear my mother’s voice imploring him and us to be careful! But these outings were adventures to us. Lots of playing ‘French and English’ -throwing pine cones at each other in the woods -and general exploring and walking. We didn’t have specific talks about health in terms of food and exercise -we learnt simply by being and doing. We also had all our inoculations as babies and young children, plus reg­ular dental checks and eye tests. And I did the same with my children. The idea of sitting down and talking to them about their health when they were young was just not something I or my husband did -we simply showed them a healthy way of life and they learnt by example. My mother was what you might call a well-endowed lady; so as soon as I showed any sign of breast development, she took me to a department store where I was measured and fitted (to my intense embarrassment) for my first bra. My mother was always very open and straightforward in answering questions about puberty too -no euphemisms, but no intense talks either. She gave me a great little pamphlet book: You And Your Body, which ex­plained all the pubertal changes to expect. As I could discuss most things with her easily, there was never an issue about periods (at the age of 13). Again, I followed her example when it came to such aspects of my daughters’ puberty -open discussions (helped by the fact that my husband was a doctor), but no ‘heavy’ talks. The girls still ring my husband for any medical advice, both for themselves, their husbands and their children. I’m assuming we did have some sort of health education at school -but I think it was only as part of biology lessons and not something specific. I don’t remember learning from magazines, and the internet didn’t exist. The only other person who had a profound influence on me and was my ‘go to’ for anything I didn’t want to discuss with my mother, was our neighbour, B. She was in between my generation and my mother’s and became a surrogate ‘big sister’ and confidante. Whenever I’d gone on too long about being dissatisfied with my appearance, or hair, or weight, she used a great expression of her mother’s: ”And my arms don’t come down to my knees!” A nonsense phrase which would make me laugh and put any little worries into perspective; after all, I was a perfectly healthy teenager at the time. You ask whether outward appear­ance relates to health; I think it relates, when you are young, to your feelings of happiness or otherwise -so I suppose loosely to mental health. I’ve never been conventionally pretty or beautiful (although I’m not ugly either!) Of course as a teenager I wanted to be as lovely as M3412 others, but I had such a great family and good friends, who liked me as I was, that my confi­dence was never dinted by not being so. I do remember B though once buying me a pair of jeans that fitted, instead of the baggy, second hand clothes I used to wear -to actually show that I had a figure! And when I look back at photos now, I realise I had nothing to worry about -I looked fine. My parents were neither of them influenced by popular ideals. My mother always looked smart for going to work, but after she retired she went in for ”comfy” elasticated waist trou­sers and what I considered to be hideous velour tops! And my father had the wonderful atti­tude of not caring what anyone thought of his outward appearance. He was very tall and slim, with incredibly long legs and used to wear very short shorts, and pink or orange long trousers. ”Ifthey’ve got nothing better to look at, I feel sorry for them” was his mantra. My brothers and I might feel embarrassed by his appearance at times, but he never did -for which I respect and admire him. I remember my mother getting ready to leave the house for work; she would sit at her dress­ing table in the bedroom and put on her make up: powder, eye shadow and a bit of lipstick, plus a squirt of ‘WhiteLinen’ perfume. My father didn’t have a specific routine, although he used to use after shave daily. When I talked to my eldest daughter about this directive, she has a similar memory of watching me get ready to go out -a little make up and a squirt of perfume. I’ve never gone in for heavy make up, but I do like to use blusher and lip stick before going out in the day time, plus eye shadow and mascara for the evening. I use a cleanser, toner and moisturiser daily -it used to be Estée Lauder, but I have recently changed to Clarins. If I was on a desert island, I don’t think I’d bother with make up -but I might like a good moisturiser. I’m lucky to have inherited good skin from my mother’s side -not too many wrinkles, although always more when I look at photos of myself than I thought were visible! I have always tried to keep healthy -walking and swimming (and some cycling) being my favourite forms of exercise. Like many women, I am never satisfied with my weight -I could always do to lose a few kilos. But I find I don’t have the will power to do work-outs or exercises as such. I used to belong to a gym when we lived in England and would have sessions there, followed by a swim. I also used to go to Pilates twice a week, which was ex­cellent. Since being in France, I have maintained the walking (energetic dogs don’t give me any choice in that;) I am lucky to live in the middle of the countryside, so walks are in the forest. I fully agree with the idea that being amongst trees and the tranquility of the country­side is excellent for your physical and mental health; whatever the weather or whatever my mood, a walk in the forest restores me to equanimity. I keep meaning to join a Pilates class in the village, but have never got round to it. And I have tried online classes, but do not en M3412 joy them; I need the discipline of paying up-front and having to go to a specific place. How­ever, we do have the luxury of an outdoor swimming pool in the garden so, in the summer, I swim every day -usually about 500 / 600 metres in about 20 minutes, ie: properly, not just bobbing around. As I grow older I am certainly more aware of those bits of my body which are feeling their age; I have arthritic problems with my knees, which have required injections and physio. And last year I had breast cancer diagnosed. Luckily, living in France, mammograms are every two years, not three as in England; so it was caught early and treated with lumpec­tomy, chemo and radiotherapy. A serious illness like that definitely makes you re-assess your whole outlook on keeping healthy, but also makes you acutely aware of the frailty of the human body and how suddenly you can be struck by disease (I had no symptoms or awareness that anything was wrong.) I cannot now relax or take my health for granted. I hope that the treatment was successful; my first post treatment check up and mammography was fine and clear, but I worry and no doubt will continue to do so for quite some time."

Male, 37, co-habiting with partner in Cardiff. Working in policy for a UK charity Part 2: Everyday health and wellbeing I associate ‘health’ with capability and a sense of freedom to do the things I would like to day to day. ‘Wellbeing’ for me is a bit broader and is a sense of being physically and mentally well, at ease or satisfied. I suppose that is quite a broad definition but I’m sure the words mean different things to different people. When I think of a ‘healthy body’ the first words that come to mind are the factors that I associate with good health and wellbeing: exercise, sleep, eating well, and removing stress. I don’t think of any particular person when I think of a healthy body. If I think a bit longer about it the image that comes to mind if one of those ancient Roman or Greek statues of a very well toned, muscular person doing some sort of activity. I’m quite aware that my initial images and word association with ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ are mainstream, not disabled etc. I’m not totally sure if my ideas of health and wellbeing are influenced by my social characteristics. My ideas are socially influenced, so they must be connected in some way. I probably first became aware of ‘health’ when I was young. My mother was a nurse and I remember a lot of discussion when I was in school (probably about 6 years old or so) about drinking my milk, exercising and so on. Food was an important part of my upbringing as I’m from a mixed British and east Asian background, and food is particularly important in east Asian culture. There’s a lot of focus in that culture on balance. And I’m fairly sure I was told to ‘eat my greens’ and to eat healthily. ‘Wellbeing’ seems like a slightly newer concept, and a bit more holistic. I’m trying to recall when I first heard it and think it could be early in my adult life, either as a student or when I started working. When I was growing up in the 80s/early 90s I obviously didn’t have access to the internet. We had a fair few books at home and I also had older siblings, who occasionally had magazines. I can’t really remember talking lots to friends about health. I think I pieced things together. My home life was quite conservative and religious and I don’t remember talking to my parents about puberty or the facts of life. I think I picked these up from a mix of friends and school sex/body education. I remember feeling like I knew a bit less than other kids. I also don’t really remember when my voice broke or when I had my first shave. I have a vague memory of borrowing my dad’s -or older brother’s -razor and shaving cream to have a go. I was a bit tentative about the whole thing and didn’t have a practical demonstration from either my dad or brother. M3462. Male, 37, co-habiting with partner in Cardiff. Working in policy for a UK charity I feel like I was a bit of a late developer in life. It wasn’t until well into my 20s that I started taking more responsibility for myself and growing up, especially emotionally. I was quite bookish and probably a bit insulated. Around that time I wasn’t very happy and put on a fair bit of weight due to overeating/drinking and not exercising much. I wasn’t keen on exercise/sport when I was young although I was okay at running. That wasn’t really a popular sport at school though. In my later 20s I took up running and ended up getting very interested in it, running half marathons and a marathon. I knew I needed to do something and running seemed like an easy sport to get into as I lived very close to some parks. I grew to really enjoy it and it helped me get fitter and feel less awkward about myself. I started running with my partner at the time and when we broke up my serious running tailed off a fair bit. I carried on, including more races, but I wasn’t so enthusiastic about it. More recently I’ve got into road cycling with the same enthusiasm. It’s a lot more social than running and I like going further and seeing sights and nature. The cycling has been affected quite a bit by the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic but I’ve acquired a smart turbo trainer so I can carry on cycling from home. I’m sure my future attitudes and approach to health and wellbeing will change, especially as I get older. I said at the beginning about how I associate my health and wellbeing with being at ease and free to do what I’d like. I’m sure I’ll have to adapt as I get older and things get more difficult. There are some signs of getting older and ageing affecting my health a little bit. I still look quite young for my age but I’ve noticed small wrinkles forming and a little bit of thinning hair around my hairline. I know these are quite superficial parts of my health but they’re just little reminders that we all get older and gradually our health fails. The Covid-19 pandemic has also affected my sense of freedom and being at ease. Not being able to travel much or socialise so much have been tough but I’m sure it’ll make me appreciate them even more when those things resume. I don’t rely on many health/beauty products but I regularly use them: the usual toiletries but also a moisturiser (one for winter and one with a mild M3462. Male, 37, co-habiting with partner in Cardiff. Working in policy for a UK charity SPF for summer) and I have a shampoo I like. Those are just parts of my routine and I’m used to using them but I feel like I could adapt and/or use different ones if I had to. I have a little beard trimmer that I like as it lets me keep a little bit of stubble but also keep it neat. I don’t have a particular routine for getting ready for work or socialising. I do broadly the same things: wash, shave/trim facial hair every few days and a little spray of aftershave. Thinking about it, my routine hasn’t changed a lot during the Covid-19 lockdowns. I’ve been working at home most of the time but still getting properly ready and dressed for work. I always used to work at home a couple of days every week and I prefer carrying out my routine even if it’s just to stay at home. I don’t particularly enjoy slobbing around without having showered or got dressed."

Male, 36, co-habiting with partner in Cardiff. Working as a policy manager for a UK charity. Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health In my household neither of us have had any particular needs for physical health support. My partner has a low-level ongoing health condition that makes her a bit more vulnerable to the virus so we’ve been conscious of that throughout and I’ve tried to do the bulk of visits to shops and collecting her prescriptions. We’ve both actually found the lockdown a bit easier for us to keep up a healthy lifestyle as we’ve been planning our meals more due to visiting shops less frequently, ‘rationing’ fatty foods and alcohol, and going on more frequent walks and doing exercise. We’ve both actually lost some weight during the lockdown, which is something that tends to happen to me when I’m feeling more settled. Mental health has been a slightly different issue. I was having two counselling sessions a month anyway to help with various long standing mental health issues. I had a bit of an unscheduled break at the beginning of the lockdown as I was very busy and didn’t get around to scheduling a session, but they were very helpful for me in just processing what was happening. The uncertainty of everything has been quite unsettling. I know we both found it difficult at home as we approached dates/anniversaries/etc and accepted that we wouldn’t be taking holidays we’d planned/hoped for. Apart from that we’re both quite laidback at home. There have been some tensions over issues to do with the house, which jobs we’re prioritising home, and our plans for the future. But overall I think it has shown that our relationship was already in a decent state before the lockdown and we also have some privileges with stable jobs/income, a spacious house and garden, and living in a busy urban area with a lot of parks, shops and spaces nearby to keep things fresh. Government I didn’t have a very high view of the UK Government before the pandemic and I’ve an even lower view now at the time of writing, about 5 months since the lockdown started. For me the key decisions were taken too slowly and there seemed to be a bit of a breezy overconfidence in how well the UK was prepared for the outbreak. This was best symbolised by Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, downplaying the risks of the virus early on, saying he was still going around shaking hands with coronavirus patients, and then apparently contracting the virus. My partner has a health condition that makes them more vulnerable to the virus and I suggested they start working at home at the beginning of March, and the lockdown didn’t start for a good two or three weeks after that. I think many more people with these conditions should have been instructed to do that. Overall the UK Government seemed to me, and still seems, too fixated on keeping certain economic interests going over the health of the population. There has been a lot of overpromising and underdelivering too, on things like the track and trace system and on testing levels more generally. A lot of government attention seems to be on managing public opinion over putting in place the steps needed to control the virus, so the track and trace system in England is reportedly only finding under half of people’s contacts but the UK Government is pushing the ‘Eat out to help out’ scheme to encourage people to eat at restaurants Monday to Wednesday. The scheme reminds me of the wartime measures in World War Two where the public were encouraged to do fairly low value actions (like donating pots and pans supposedly for making into weapons/planes) to keep them onside. I’m sure I’m not the only respondent who will mention the incident where Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s main adviser, was spotted breaking lockdown rules the government he worked for set but facing almost zero consequences for doing so. For me it was quite symbolic of the state of the UK Government overall: that rules are just for the little people and there to be ignored for the elite, who claim to be anti-establishment. I resent Cummings more every time I learn more about him. News Living in Wales I was irritated by the UK media’s lack of attention and inaccurate reporting of the virus in Wales. Many journalists said things applied to the ‘UK’ or to ‘Wales and England’ when they really meant England. They seem so oblivious to world outside of London. It also means people in Wales get inaccurate information about what’s really happening. I know, for example, that the tracking and tracing scheme in Wales is much, much better than in England and many fewer people have died from the virus as well. But the figures all seemed to get lumped together with England, so people probably think the Welsh Government is not doing that well either. Having said that, I’ve seen opinion polls that rate the Welsh Government’s response to the virus much more highly. Definitely in my area of work I’ve seen the Welsh Government do some very good and effective things in response to the virus that are much better than what’s happening in England. I know a lot of people in Wales are hearing more about the First Minister and Welsh Cabinet from the press briefings on TV. The brief for this directive mentions the BSL interpreters appearing at the Scotland briefings with Nicola Sturgeon, but Wales has been doing it as well. I like that the devolved governments are being more accessible with their communication and making sure deaf people who use BSL can get the same health information as everyone else. It says a lot to me that the UK Government briefings don’t use BSL interpreters. Work and home life Both I and my partner have continued to work during the lockdown. I was very well setup to do so anyway due to my role, and the fact I’m quite mobile in my job anyway and have a work laptop and mobile. Before the lockdown I’d be working from a few different offices and my home anyway, so this was just an extension of what I was already doing. It was a big process of adapting for my colleagues in London though as many hadn’t done so before and they often live in quite small living spaces where there isn’t a lot of space to work separately from the more domestic spaces. That’s a privilege I’ve had and I don’t forget that I have a proper small office space in a box room in the house (and my partner has a dinner table to work on in a separate room and we’re both working in our favourite working spaces in the house.)  In a strange way I’ve quite enjoyed having more time together with my partner (e.g. lunch times together) so when we see each other properly in the evening we’ve already talked about work during the day and can think about other things. I’ve also felt less rushed because I haven’t been travelling to offices or meetings for work and have been able to use that time for lying in, spending more time preparing meals, or doing other things. We only have a cat at home and no other pets or children, so that’s another struggle we haven’t had. Working around childcare commitments has been really big for some colleagues/friends, especially those who have children younger than teens who are a bit less self-sufficient. They’ve had to be quite flexible and work at slightly odd times of day when the kids are in bed. People sometimes seem to joke that ‘working a home’ means pretending to work but my experience has been very different. Due to my area of work I’ve been equally busy as when my work has peaked in the past in normal times. There has been little let up although at the time of writing in August, with the school summer holidays coming and a heatwave just passing, everyone seems to have slowed down a bit more than before. Some friends have been furloughed and I know many were keen to carry on volunteering their time to other organisations or causes. The weather during lockdown has also been good overall, which has helped everyone feel at least a little bit better. Our relationship at home has been okay although I’ve felt quite anxious at some points during the lockdown and both my partner and I have gone through phases of feeling a bit fed up with being restricted and by life seeming a bit more monotonous than usual. I started to really miss seeing friends and family, and being spontaneous and going for a pint in the pub in the evening. As the lockdown lifted a bit across Wales we have been seeing friends in parks and visiting family in gardens and that has been really enjoyable. I’ve really savoured those experiences and don’t want to take them for granted again. We haven’t been very quick to relax our own personal lockdown, so while pubs/restaurants have opened indoors now we haven’t been yet but have had some takeaways. A friend of mine commented about life during the lockdown that rung true for me, particularly in the early stages. He said every morning felt like a Monday and every evening like a Friday. Technology Access to technology has made a difference to me during lockdown. As I mentioned before, I was used to working remotely before and with colleagues across GB I was used to video calls etc. We have probably had more meetings during the lockdown than before, probably because London based colleagues are more used to having lots of contact with each other. We’ve started using Zoom rather than our official work platform (Skype) because it seems to work a bit better and we can use it for external meetings more easily. Apart from that I’ve used Whatsapp a bit more to stay in touch with people I would’ve contacted anyway. I’ve sent a few ‘welfare’ messages during the lockdown, just checking on friends and family and especially those who I know live alone. Things during the lockdown seem to have gone through phases. Early on a lot of people were trying the Houseparty app, which we tried a couple of times, but that has tailed off. We’ve also had a few notable events happen, like friends’ birthdays, where we’d normally meet in person so we’ve been trying to replace that with video calls. It’s not quite the same although I have to admit sometimes it’s quite nice for me as a bit of an introvert to be still at home while socialising. Some of our best times during the lockdown have been over technology, whether celebrating friends’ birthdays or catching up. We’ve also listened in to a DJ that we both like who used Twitch to broadcast a set of songs, including a video of him DJing and a chat box. That was great for us and had sentimental value as we used to see that DJ at a pub that has now closed. The pub was where we met each other for the first time, introduced by a friend. Shopping and food We’ve changed our shopping habits during lockdown and made some smaller changes to our food. Before the lockdown we’d usually visit our local shops quite regularly, even every few days, and we have a good spread of shops within 5 mins walk including a corner shop, ‘world’ food shop, a fruit/veg shop, and a small supermarket for other things. During the lockdown we switched to making one visit to each shop for the week, which I made so that my partner could stay away due to their health condition. It’s not been a huge change as we’ve tended to plan our meals a bit before lockdown. But it has removed a little bit of flexibility that I used to enjoy, but that’s not really a big problem. I really enjoy cooking a range of different cuisines, and trying to cook new ones, so the lockdown has given me time to do more cooking and to perfect some techniques. I realise this might not be typical but I feel lucky to not have financial worries and to have time. I dislike supermarkets at the best of times and rarely visited, and have not been to one or ordered online. I can’t even remember the last time I did either anyway regardless of the coronavirus.  I find them too big and they seem to have lots of versions of the same items, and I find them a bit crowded and stressful. Our eating habits have been largely the same as they would have been but lunches have changed, given we’re at home rather than in our offices or on the go. Working at home has given me a lot of consistency in my working location, as I mentioned previously, so I’ve been able to plan things out a bit more. For lunches we’ve eaten slightly more elaborate meals, just things like salads or soups, but been able to spend a bit more time preparing. We’ve baked a little more, including bread and flatbreads, and some cakes/desserts. That’s mainly because we’ve had a bit more time for processes like dough proving as we’re staying in the house anyway. One thing I’ve liked doing is using up old ingredients that have been hanging about and many of which are past their best before dates. This includes dried noodles and pasta, flavoured oils, old packets of tea etc. It has been like having a clearout but without having to throw things out. I hate food waste and I have to admit it has been slightly stressful for me after the shopping day to try to find space for everything and to worry a little bit about not using up everything. We’ve stocked up a little more on some things like tinned tomatoes, coconut milk and tinned beans/pulses just as a little nod to pandemic preparedness but we haven’t gone overboard. We drank alcohol quite often but lightly during the early stages of the lockdown. I remember our first day working at home together was on St Patrick’s Day and we had some Guinness cans in the kitchen and stood around for while as if we were in a bar. There was something novel and almost amusing about it. Since the early stages we’ve tailed off a bit and have found that we’re drinking less than we would in a pub. There we’d have had a couple of pints each but at home maybe we’d have a couple of half pints each. Speaking to friends it really varies but some seem to have been drinking a lot more. We were both keen to support local businesses as well, so we got some beer/wine deliveries and more recently I’ve been cycling out and returning with a bag full of drink from an independent shop we used to visit before lockdown. Those and some orders to independent food shops (bakeries and delis) are the only food and drink deliveries we’ve had. Somehow also we’ve both managed to lose weight during the lockdown. I think it’s a mix of the new structure, fewer opportunities to snack because we’re not popping to shops on a whim, and going out of our ways to make sure we do daily walks and exercise to stay fit. Entertainment and leisure We’ve gone in phases with our entertainment and leisure habits. We’ve been watching films/programmes on a range of platforms and channels, mainly on-demand like Netflix, BBC or our TV recorder box. We haven’t really branched out a lot, just been watching more of our normal shows, a mix of films, documentaries, food programmes etc. Friends, family and colleagues have been sharing recommendations, so we have watched a few things we wouldn’t usually have watched. We’ve missed watching cycling coverage as the races have been cancelled or delayed by the lockdown. It’s usually a big part of our spring and summer to watch a lot of cycling races, and a few times we did watch some older classic races on YouTube with friends who are also into cycling watching at the same time. That was earlier on when things were still a bit novel. We’ve been watching a few complete seasons of programmes due to having some extra time and I have to mention the Tiger King series on Netflix, which I’ll forever associate with that surreal time at the beginning of lockdown. It was a very odd show about an eccentric man in the USA and seemed just right for the slightly unhinged times. Everyone seems to have forgotten about it now. We also watched a TV adaptation of Normal People, which was a nice escape. Early on I had some aspirations to develop some skills, like continuing with my French learning that I’d been doing on and off for a while and maybe some practical skills. It was hard to focus particularly for a few months earlier on as my mind was often racing and on reflection I was probably in survival mode thinking about our food, safety, hygiene measures etc. I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts, some factual/documentary and some lighthearted cultural ones. I haven’t avoided the coronavirus episodes and have found them informative/useful even though I’ve more or less stopped watching news programmes on TV.  I’ve also been carrying on with reading similar things to what I read before, a lot about culture and history. It has been quite a nice mental break to think about broader things than just the lockdown, such as other countries and periods of history. We’ve taken some of the extra time at home to start and/or finish some DIY jobs. Nothing heavy, just painting, deep cleaning some parts of the house, sanding/treating wooden worktops, and a lot of sorting through old stuff and boxes. We had a mini infestation of carpet moths during the lockdown so learned quite a lot about controlling those and have (fingers crossed) got rid of them now. We also have a garden and have spent quite a bit of time tending to that and my partner looks after the plants and some edible things that we’ve been growing (e.g. herbs, courgettes and cucumbers). One thing we’ve done very consistently throughout lockdown is evening walks. Early on the Welsh Government regulations were for one exercise per day, so I tended to choose between an early bike ride or a walk. The bike rides were interesting as the lockdown had changed the city quite a lot and actually made cycling quite enjoyable as there were almost no cars about. I saw the city centre all deserted during rush hour and also other areas that would normally be busy. Our walks have started at home and been about 30 mins or so, with some longer ones at the weekend. We’ve got to know our neighbourhood really well, including places like back lanes and cut-throughs, little quirky buildings, and have admired some house/garden arrangements that we’ve looked at for ideas about our own. At some points we also foraged some blackberries, raspberries and plums that were growing from hedgerows or over back walls into lanes. We have a few standard routes that take us in different directions so we vary our route depending on the weather or how we feel. The weather has been quite good for most of the lockdown. I can only remember a handful of rainy evenings, and that has made being inside a lot easier. Personal hygiene My personal hygiene habits have stayed largely the same during lockdown. Having worked at home before I knew that washing and getting dressed were a good way to wake up and get into the right mindset for the working day. I’ve been dressing slightly down during the lockdown, including shorts for more formal meetings on Zoom. But overall I know from previous experience that it’s a good habit for me to dress for work and then change into more casual and relaxed clothes at other times. It helps separate my work and home lives. I don’t shave every day anyway but tend to keep my face stubble trimmed every couple of days so it’s neat and I shave around the edge to make sure there’s a clean line around my stubble and the rest of my face. That’s largely the same as before lockdown and I’m possibly even doing it more regularly now, partly due to having more time in the morning and also being on video calls. You get to see how your face looks much more often than when you do face to face meetings. The most notable change has been with haircuts. I know a lot of people struggled with not getting theirs done and there were a lot of interesting DIY jobs attempted. I was no different and I had ‘panic bought’ some hair clippers right at the beginning of lockdown, probably before other people had thought it through. I’d fortunately had a haircut, I think in late February, so it wasn’t until a few months into lockdown that I really felt it needed a cut. I’d usually go to my hairdresser once every six weeks or so. He’s not a fancy one, very cheap in fact, but it was still a challenge to try to recreate it at home. My partner helped with the back of my head but I did a lot of the front and sides, mainly so I could show my partner what look I was after for the back. I was a bit nervous about doing it as I didn’t want to mess up my hair given it’s relatively short and I spend a lot of time on video calls. As part of my work I sometimes appear on the news as well, so I didn’t want to look silly. The haircut was actually fine in the end and bought me a lot of time until the hairdressers reopened! It was very strange going back. He’d had a refurb during the lockdown so his place was looking very good. It was still weird in July sitting in a room with people I didn’t know for the first time since early March. Sleep and mental health I slept relatively well during the lockdown. I was having some very surreal and vivid dreams early on, that I think other people were having too. I can’t really remember them but a lot of them were mashed up versions of real things that had happened during the day mixed with worries or thoughts I’d had during the day but hadn’t expressed. There were some bad dreams, not quite nightmares but where things were going wrong at work or I was catching the virus. Even more regularly than that were dreams about people I knew and loved getting sick and/or dying. I don’t think it needs an expert in dream analysis to figure out where those were coming from! I’ve had some sleep disruption on days when my mind was racing, usually coinciding with my trips to the shops as those were my closest encounters with people during the week. I used to get a bit irritable on those days as I got more anxious and would sometimes feel like I was buzzing and on edge when I got back, like I’d been through a really dangerous experience. I suppose my body and subconscious mind felt like I was. My mental health more generally has been up and down. I had some pre-existing mental health difficulties before lockdown. Nothing really medically treatable, just really low moods sometimes and/or general anxiety. I’m glad that I’ve been accessing counselling for a long time as it’s given me the skills and experience to cope with the ups and downs. So I haven’t felt thrown by the outbreak and the changes despite not always feeling great about things. Some basic things have helped. I’ve kept a diary throughout the lockdown and it has been good to feel like the time is being recorded and each day is unique. Exercise and getting out on slightly longer cycle rides has been good both for physical and mental health, seeing new surroundings, visiting beaches or nature further away or just getting out on my own to recharge. I’ve gained some sense of achievement from the little things as well: cleaning, sorting or fixing things at home; making a nice meal; or getting through the tough days. I know I have a lot of privileges compared with many people and I don’t take them for granted."

But what other people inadvertently within about health and wellbeing in everyday life? your reply. It is best to use initials We learn about health in many different instead of real names. ways, and it can mean different things to different people depending on their circumstances. In this Directive, we want to find out what health and wellbeing means to you (and what it meant before COVID-19) but particularly where your ideas about health and wellbeing came from, and what has influenced your own experiences of health and wellbeing in everyday life. Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. I think being healthy means having a body that works and is fit enough to do what you want it to. Wellbeing is probably more about mental health and mood. A healthy body is fit, functioning, active, strong, flexible I’d probably think first of an athlete, but I don’t think you have to be an athlete to be healthy, I think as long as you look after your body and keep in reasonable shape you could be considered healthy. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I think women’s sexual health hasn’t had nearly as much attention as men’s and it’s quite common for women to have health problems that the medical profession just hasn’t a clue about and isn’t interested in, and women just accept it and suffer in silence because they’re used to it. I think if men had endometriosis or painful periods or pain during sex they wouldn’t rest until they had the problem sorted. But women experience all of this all the time and there’s very little interest in tackling it or even educating GPs about it. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”? Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? No one really talked about health or wellbeing when I was young (in the 80s and 90s). My mother worried if you didn’t eat, and she dieted a lot herself but we weren’t told about healthy eating or exercising. I think we covered health in PE classes in school. It was mostly about getting enough protein and which fats were good or bad. I remember having a ‘health test’ of some sort where they measured your pulse before and after exercise and pinched you to measure body fat. The girls worried about the body fat and I don’t think that was a good thing to do to us in front of everyone. Mental health was never mentioned. A couple of teachers at school were rumoured to have had ‘nervous breakdowns’, which seemed a very dramatic thing that was only whispered about but we had no idea what it actually meant. In my head it involved complete collapse, possibly screaming! In fact it was only much later in life, looking back, that I realised they’d just suffered from depression or something. I was quite an angsty teen and I think these days I’d have been sent to a school counsellor or something. In fact my parents did occasionally ‘threaten’ to send me to a psychologist. But I did take this as a ‘threat’ rather than an offer of help, and possibly they did partly mean it as a way to scare me into being normal. Looking back, I think my only problem was that I was a very introverted person living in a noisy house and I liked being alone. A counsellor might have been able to explain that to me and my family and save me many years of thinking there was something wrong with me. There must have been lots of kids at my school with issues but it just wasn’t a thing that was talked about. I’m not sure the school saw it as their responsibility to look after that part of our lives. Key moments M6082 As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example? How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I’ve always been a very ‘in my own head’ person and fairly unaware of myself from the neck down so I barely noticed puberty. But I do remember getting a bra, and the girls in the school changing room laughing at it because it was so tiny (I really didn’t need it). I remember another girl being laughed at because she developed quite early. I had no idea about shaving and my mother never talked to me about things like that. I had to ask her which bits to shave! When I got my first boyfriend at 16 I still had hairy armpits and he didn’t care at all. This was the late 90s. But there was no internet or social media so we weren’t comparing each other to models etc. In a way I think the internet is great because kids today are much more clued in about sexuality and diversity and consent, but I also think we were lucky because our body image wasn’t so affected by things like porn and Instagram. I found my periods an annoyance and couldn’t understand why I was supposed to feel ‘grown up’ when they started. It didn’t seem like something ‘special’ to me. It felt monstrously unfair that I had to endure them and boys didn’t. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I’ve never thought much about my health or wellbeing. I’ve been lucky in that I’ve never been overweight or had any major health issues, mental or physical. But I’m in my 40s now and starting to notice aches and pains and sagginess. I walk a lot, because I enjoy it, but also to keep fit. And I garden a lot but my garden is on a slope and I’m becoming aware that when I’m older it may be too hard for me to manage on my own. I put on about a stone during the first Covid lockdown, and put some effort into losing it and I’m aware that my weight has crept up a little bit over the last decade and I suspect this will continue. I never thought about mental health until my husband suffered from depression 5 years ago. I’ve since had quite a stressful job myself and did consider counselling at one point. I think if things got worse I would go to counselling. Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? I find external appearance a bit of an annoyance and one that’s particularly onerous for women. I hate having to bother with makeup and wear it as seldom as possible. I’m not very interested in fashion or hairstyles and I spend very little on beauty products. I’m interested in being slim and flexible, mostly because it makes life easier, and I’d put more effort into that than into my face and hair. My mother has spent most of her life on a diet and has always been slim and has bleached blonde hair, and my sister trained as a beautician and they and my cousin all love shopping for clothes, so I’m considered a bit odd in my family. My dad complains about and laughs at the millions of products my mum uses, but I know he likes her to be blonde and look nice so I think it’s a bit hypocritical and I wouldn’t put up with that from a man. My skin is a bit dry and I use moisturizer every day and lip balm most days, and I use a lot of hand cream. So my desert island product would be Nivea Face, Hand and Body Cream. I have a very basic makeup kit that I’d happily live without. I think one of the best things about Covid has been not wearing makeup. I like perfume but I’m as likely to wear it at home just for myself as out in public. Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I remember my mum getting ready to go out because her perfume would fill the house and I loved that smell. She always seemed very glamorous. She had sliderobe wardrobes with mirror doors and would spend ages doing her hair and makeup. She still has several drawers filled with more makeup than you could ever wear in your life. If I need new makeup I still raid them rather than buying stuff. She loves buying products. My dad would shave with an electric razor but he never used any products. I think he even considered deodorant girly. If I’m going for a night out or an important work thing I’ll wear makeup but I wear very little and it takes me about 5 minutes. When my hair was short I’d curl it a bit, when it’s long I straighten it with straighteners but that doesn’t take long either. I like looking nice but I wouldn’t go to the trouble unless it was for something important. I’m aware that people are nicer to you when you look nice, particularly men, and if I go to a pub where all the girls are dolled up and I’m not I feel a bit self-conscious and frumpy, but most of the time it’s not worth the effort. In the future I can see myself going grey because I wouldn’t be bothered keeping up with hair dying. But I might also feel more self-conscious and end up dying my hair and wearing more makeup, I don’t know yet.

Health, wellbeing and the healthy body What does “health” mean to you? What does “wellbeing” mean to you? How do you define these words? Health to me means ‘in the absence of illness’ and includes both physical and mental health. Wellbeing is the padding to health. Like cushions on a comfy sofa. The sense of being in a position to enjoy life without mental or physical illness. But I think wellbeing encompasses much more than just an absence of infliction and needs to be expanded to incorporate physiological needs such as enough to eat, somewhere safe to live, heating, hot water, enough clothes to wear, access to sanitary products. In addition, a sense of belonging and access to companionship which has become even more apparent in the last year.  What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term.  Mobile, strong, free from illness, functional, radiant. Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Identity How do you think that your own experience of health and wellbeing has been influenced by your gender, ethnicity, social class, or sexual orientation? Do you think your experience of health has been influenced by these or other aspects of your identity at all? I am a white, female, middle class, straight(ish) child of the 80’s growing up in North East England. We never had conversations in our house about health. We only had conversations about fatness. Not being fat = healthy; Being fat = not healthy. Nearly every conversation I had with a health practitioner at that time also revolved around the same equation. It was the time of constant dieting. Low fat, high carb. Skimmed everything. Liver once a week because ‘it was good for you’. Weight watchers. Diet sheets. My experience of health and wellbeing has been an exploration. I’ve learned a lot from peers and friends about what it looks like. I’ve learned that self-care is essential, not a luxury or an act of selfishness. I’ve learned health is way more than a number on a set of scales or a dress size.  Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing When and where did you first become aware of “health” or of “wellbeing”?  I cant really remember. As a concept it was probably when I first started my personal trainers course when we discussed the inter connection between physical and mental health.  Who had responsibility for looking after your health and wellbeing when you were younger? I lived with my parents until I was approximately 14. But both were relatively absent in their own misery. School teachers contributed but ultimately the responsibility fell to me. Do you remember your parents, or other caregivers, talking to you about health? If so, what did they talk to you about? Where did these conversations take place? We never really had a conversation about any aspects of health other than weight. I didn’t know to wash my hands after going to the toilet, or why I had to brush my teeth or coping strategies for stressful situations. I would go and sit in the woods until I felt better – I didn’t know why that worked or the benefits of being in nature per se. I didn’t know what to do when my period happened (I was 15).  Did you receive any education about health in school? And/or did you learn about health and wellbeing in other ways – from friends, magazines, or the internet, for example? All of my education around health came from friends and the school. We were extraordinarily lucky to go to a school with amazing teachers who look after our welfare as well as our education. I learned about the concept of ‘being kind’ from them first and foremost. They showed us such kindness and generosity. Among other things they taught us about sex ed, fitness, mental health and the importance of freedom. I’m still learning about health and wellbeing now. The internet has facilitated the access and means to more information than we can possibly digest and lockdown, the time to access and consider more of that information. At 48, I’ve finally been able to experiment with mindfulness and explore what that means. And I’ve started to understand what constitutes a healthy diet, the role of sleep, mindfulness and meditation, breathwork, stress relief techniques, functional fitness and a healthy work/life balance actually looks like.  Key moments As an adolescent, when did you first become aware of bodily changes associated with puberty? Age 10 when the girls started to develop breasts and the talk in the school yard turned to wearing bras.  Are there any moments or rituals that you think are particularly important for young women or men? These might include, but are not limited to, first period, voice breaking, buying the first bra, or shaving, for example?  I find the whole thing almost unbearable to think about. I understand in certain cultures these examples can feel like a right of passage and a time to celebrate. To be embraced by the sisterhood. It just served to make me aware of how alone I was. How did you feel about these moments if/when they happened to you? I spent the whole time embarrassed and bewildered. Growing older Throughout your life, what if anything, have you done to actively maintain your health both physically and mentally? Has this changed at all over the years? If so, was this due to a particular event in your life? I’ve always been active. I discovered endurance events and loved the mental positivity of long distance. I love being outdoors, exploration and the feeling of freedom. Being in the  weather has a way of making you feel alive like nothing else. I take care of myself in a much more constructive way now. I’m curious and will ask questions to seek information rather than remaining passive.  Where do you get information about health and wellbeing now? The internet is a great place to start. I will consult with experts and authorities on subjects now. I’ve also studied a lot as it really interests me. I’ve got a degree in sports physiology, done a personal trainers course and am now studying counselling.  Would you say you are you more or less aware of your body now? Why do you think this is? I’m much more aware of my body these days. Conscious of its wonders and limitations. I think the awareness is part wisdom and part realisation that it starts to fall apart if it’s not being looked after. For example, I’ve noticed it appears to be much more sensitive to nutrition these days. Less tolerant of gluten and dairy. It’s something my friends of a similar age have noticed and so I wonder if that is a product of aging.  I also notice I tend to have a few more niggles now than I used to and clambering off the couch seems a little more difficult of late .. In future years how do you expect your approach to health and wellbeing to change? I hope that I’ll be able to maintain health and wellbeing. I suspect that ‘be more kind’ might need to be applied to myself more than I did in my youth. I suspect there may also be an increased change from physical fitness to functional fitness. I find myself identifying what I would like to be able to do in my old age (work on my allotment, get up from a chair without using the arms, get up from the floor if I fall over, be able to move around under my own steam rather than relying on a wheel chair or motorised chair) form much more of my thoughts now than being able to cycle for 100 miles.  Health, wellbeing and appearance In your view, how are health and wellbeing related to external appearance? Only in regard to self confidence (There is a rider here in that morbid obesity obviously will affect health and as a result wellbeing). In the health and fitness industry I see lots of gorgeous women who radiate with well-being who are vilified for being ‘fat’. The connection of health to external appearance is in the most part judgmental and damaging.  Have you ever been influenced by popular ideals of beauty or physical appearance? As a young person I longed to be thin. Not to be idolised but rather to become invisible. Fatness has the most amazing ability to render you both invisible and incredibly visible at the same time. Do you think your parents were influenced by these kinds of ideals? If so, in what way? My mum was always on a diet. We never discussed the reasons behind it so I have no idea why the drive was there. That said, it was 70’s and fat in food was vilified in those days. Are there any health or beauty products (excluding medicines) that you couldn’t live without? What would be your Desert Island item? Does toothpaste count as a medicine? Getting ready to leave the house Do you remember your mother or father getting ready to go out for work, or for the evening? If so, can you describe their rituals? Both parents had a going out routine. Mum = bathtime, blow dry, eyebrow pluck, draw them back in (?), make up applied, clothes on and out the door. Dad = bathtime, shave in the downstairs mirror, aftershave applied (Old Spice), clothes on and out the door. Dad often used to boil water from the garden water butt to wash his hair – he believed it was purer than from the tap. Bearing in mind we lived in a mining district and all most of the areas domestic heating was fuelled by coal – I had my doubts.  What is your own routine when getting ready to go out for work or for socialising? Has this routine changed over time? I have the same routine I have always used. Shower, dry, clothes on, go. I don’t wear make up. I wouldn’t know what to do with it. When I got married my husband bought and applied my make up. He certainly knows a lot more about it than I do. I have always figured that I was quietly rebelling against the system.

Mass-Observer M6749 describes themself as female; age 65; married; retired university administrator.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","M6749, Female, 65, married, Oxford, retired university administrator Part 2: Everyday health and wellbeing Health, to me, is the capacity that an individual or a group has to eat well, sleep well and be adequately active. Someone who is healthy can do all these things in daily life without too much difficulty, and if you can’t do one or more of these things, you are not really healthy.  Wellbeing, to me, is the consequence of using this capacity for health – a comfort or sense of ease. There are both physical and mental aspects of wellbeing. Words that come to mind when I think of a healthy body:  resilient, efficient, natural, balanced, sound. There isn’t a particular image that comes to mind when I think of these qualities. My own experience of health has been influenced, firstly, by my age. For my parents’ generation the threat of disease was real, as were pre-NHS medical costs. My father nearly died of diphtheria when he was four; my mother of pneumonia in her twenties just as the first antibiotic treatments became available. In my generation we caught measles, whooping cough, chicken pox and mumps one after the other, whole classrooms at the same time.  The exceptions were polio, for which a vaccine had just been developed; tuberculosis, for which the BCG vaccine had been available for some time, diphtheria, tetanus and smallpox.   As a small girl I recall having to go with my family to a sort of portacabin where we had chest X rays: a case of TB had emerged at the school where my father taught and the local authority was vigorous in tracing contacts. I also remember attending ‘sun-ray sessions’ on Friday afternoons. Fifty or sixty small children sat in a darkened room with vests removed and wearing googles against the light of a sun lamp. This was supposed to help us fight colds and coughs by increasing our Vitamin D levels. Class has also influenced my health. It was a long time before I realised how childhood diseases which to us seemed routine are very serious for disadvantaged or poorly nourished children; or how privileged we had been that our mother didn’t work outside the home and so was able to nurse us when we were unwell. This meant that we had enough time off school to recover properly from an illness before going back into the fray. A third factor has been gender. When I was old enough to become a feminist (1970s and 1980s), women’s health and sexual health were big topics: like many women at the time I took active steps to understand how my body worked and what could go wrong.  At the time this felt like an obligation: we saw the medical profession as male-dominated and not especially informed about or supportive of women’s health. The moment when I realised that I could inform myself and take charge of my own health was definitely a key moment. Everyone I knew bought a copy of ‘Our Bodies Ourselves’. I reached puberty quite late (I started menstruating at thirteen and a half) but had read books given to me my mother and knew roughly what to expect. Looking back, at the time I don’t seem to have been very interested in bodily changes. I was much more affected by a tendency to faint, which I’m now sure was hormonal. It was very embarrassing. As I was growing up health (and particularly nutrition) was taught by my parents around the kitchen table. We ate our cabbage, not to remember the starving children in the world, but because cabbage is nutritious. All cooking at home was done from scratch and until I was in my teens, my mother’s menus followed second world war rationing principles – wholegrains, plain vegetables, fresh fruit, raw food, fish, and not much meat or dairy except milk. By today’s standards, though, there was too much sugar, which may explain why our teeth needed to be filled from the age of six.  In my mother’s mind this diet had kept people healthy and it would do the same for us. Mum was particularly keen on digestive health: syrup of figs, a fennel-tasting laxative and liquid paraffin were all kept in the medicine cupboard and dispensed freely.  M6749, Female, 65, married, Oxford, retired university administrator There were also many stories at home about the difference that the coming of the NHS had made. One of my father’s favourite novels (and now one of mine) was The Citadel by A.J.Cronin. I picked it out of his bookshelf when I was seven or eight and was horrified by its account of the impact of poverty, poor living conditions and an incompetent and corrupt medical profession on ordinary people’s health.  I would say that this novel has been a very strong influence on me. My father’s family were quarrymen and canalmen in a Black Country industrial village: injury at work or sickness usually led to unemployment or premature death. Both my grandfathers died, I think, from overwork. All my father’s family told stories about the coming of the NHS and how grateful they had been to have long standing conditions treated at last. By contrast, my mother’s middle class family could afford to pay for medical treatment when needed. She kept a slightly snobbish preference for private medicine until the end of her life. Both my parents were keen on exercise: on team games and sports of all kinds (they were both teachers, so could hardly advocate otherwise); and on walking. My mother cycled and attended aerobics classes until her mid eighties. I’ve inherited an enjoyment of walking and yoga from her but have learned that I can’t handle anything too competitive. No one at home was any good at sleeping and I have inherited that too. I now think that both my parents were susceptible to stress and found it difficult to relax. In my house 3am was often a busy time – people talking to each other downstairs in the kitchen, clunking the biscuit tin, opening and shutting the fridge, making milky drinks and cups of tea. My father’s mental health was often poor: he had periods which would now be diagnosed and treated as anxiety and depression, which made him withdrawn and irritable. At home this was described as ‘worry’. When I was working, not only did I smoke cigarettes, but I had appalling sleep patterns and day after day would get up and drive a long commute on three or four hours’ sleep.  Now that I have retired one of my greatest pleasures is to know that I can wake in the light for almost all the year and will not have to get up immediately and drive. I value good sleep. I’m generally much more aware of health and wellbeing now. Five years ago I had a period of depression. I was lucky enough to be offered a new talking therapy called interpersonal therapy (there were studies going on locally). I learned how to take care of myself on an ongoing basis to help prevent it happening again. I know that I have to be aware of who makes up my network of family and friends, particularly those who give me support, and to give them regular time and attention. I have to take some kind of physical exercise and to eat properly on a daily basis. Looking back, this was an unpleasant enough event in my life to make me change my behaviour. I hope that I’ll continue to be able to look after my health. At the moment I am overweight, although not obese. I know that reducing by two stones will be helpful and that I need to take it seriously over the next year.  I get most of my health information online: for example, the NHS website, which is informative and, in my opinion, reliable. I’m astonished at the amount of ‘health advice’ available online and on social media and tend to regard it all as rubbish. I have never really understood a connection between health and wellbeing and external appearance. I haven’t bothered about looking ‘young’ since the age of about 25 although I did dye my hair until I turned 50. I have never regretted stopping that. I fell in love with my wife because to me, she is the most beautiful woman I know, both in appearance and in personality, and that’s enough. However I do have really dry skin and worry that if I were cast away without lip balm my lips would crack like badly cast concrete. Perhaps if my desert island had sheep I could gather lanolin from their wool. Otherwise I’d suffer. M6749, Female, 65, married, Oxford, retired university administrator My routine for leaving the house is very basic. If I’m leading a visitor tour at the library or welcoming visitors at the church, I try to look neat and respectable, and that’s it. That’s very similar to how I saw things when I was working, since I was lucky enough to work for most of my career in marvellous organisations which didn’t judge women’s contribution by their appearance. I know my mother would be horrified; once her Baptist mother died she was free to wear lipstick and never left the house without it. I’m not going to worry about whether that really is freedom."

Mass-Observer M6749 describes themself as female; age 64; married; retired university administrator.;The Directive 'COVID-19 (Update)' was issued on 27 April 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular 'health'; 'the government'; 'news'; 'work and home life'; 'technology'; 'shopping and food'; 'entertainment and leisure'; 'personal hygiene' and 'sleep'.","Part 2: Covid19 (Update) Health Note: I am writing this on 27 May, so it may be that something changes over the next few weeks. Until now I have been extremely fortunate. I have been exposed to the coronavirus but as far as I know I haven’t contracted Covid-19. I am lucky that I am retired, so have not had concerns about whether or how to work from home, or about income. My house is small but it’s okay. We have a small garden and I have an allotment plot. I am fortunate to share the house with my wife and we can have as much online contact with family and friends as we want. I’m in good health. My wife has diabetes, so is being particularly careful not to become exposed to coronavirus. She is also waiting for an operation to remove an ovarian cyst, which has been deemed essential but not urgent, so has been delayed. At times she has had extreme pain from the cyst, but the GP has told her that there is nothing that she can do to help while the hospital is clearing urgent surgery. If we go to A&E we will just be sent home again. Being cooped up together for the past few weeks has been okay – in fact it has been nice to have company for more of the day. The physical distance from family and friends feels no worse than when I lived abroad in pre-internet times. We have caught up on books, watched films, rested, enjoyed the sun and been in touch with friends and family. Something that helped was that five years ago I had a patch of depression and learned some daily routines to avoid slipping back. That experience has been useful. We both have a few low days. I sometimes wonder what Iam ‘supposed’ to be doing and whether I am using my time constructively enough. I am sure there would have been more of these days if either of us or anyone in our family had become seriously ill, or if the weather had not been so good, or if we had no outside space to let off steam. There is no question that we know how well off we are: people who are home-schooling, or unwell, or worried about elderly relatives, have had a lot more worry. I have volunteered for the second phase of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial, for people 56-69. It feels like a small useful thing that I can do here where I live. The Government Without doubt the government has been caught on the hop. There have been emergency management planning exercises (of course) but the lessons have not been learned. Supplies of protective equipment available for workers who have high exposure to the new virus have been lacking. Our long standing disconnect between health and social care services has been left unaddressed for too long and we are experiencing the consequences. Also I don’t now understand why the early contact tracing efforts were so poor and were dropped so quickly. The UK has had STI tracing for decades and local authority tracing, for example for food poisoning outbreaks. I started out extremely sympathetic to the horrible situation the Government was faced with but I now feel very disappointed and mistrustful. Like most people I am very relieved at the Government’s financial support for workers, businesses and the economy in general. However the steep hill that we will have to climb to repair the economy need not have been so steep. I cannot understand why the country was not formally locked down until 23 March, why a public health mass testing programme for Covid-19 was not prioritised and developed early on and why the appalling situation in care homes and prisons remained hidden from view for so long. I can’t shake from my mind the suspicion that the Government thought that it was unavoidable, or even acceptable, for a lot of disabled or elderly people to die, or why it took so long to realise that so many of the casualties would be black or from other minority ethnic groups. In future? They need to take a track, trace and isolate approach seriously. What seems lacking at the moment is an efficient system (results should not be delayed). They also need to be prepared to confront people who won’t isolate. Over the past few weeks, like most people I am aware of a very few friends and neighbours who already don’t stick to the ‘rules’. I am not happy that I have so quickly lost respect forpeoplewhothinkit’sokaytoputothersat riskby not cooperating. I have given up some of my volunteering because I have seen a different side to a few individuals. Realistically, they need to decide what should happen to individuals who really won’t cooperate. News I’m relying mainly on the BBC for news and (contrary to the criticism that it has attracted) I think the quality of investigation and explanation has been very good. I generally read the Guardian and the Economist for comment and for contrasting perspectives. I have watched the Government briefings. It is a good idea to have regular and consistent briefings but I am weary of the format and increasingly I distrust the official figures and explanations of policy, which seem repetitive, disingenuous and poorly pitched. I shouldn’tbe so affectedbythebumblingdeliveryand verbiage of the men and women in suits, but I am. Some of the scientists/senior medics are as managerial in their speech as the ministers and as little able to communicate with their audience. In particular I am aghast at the inability of the prime minister to speak clearly, answer direct questions and, at times, finish a sentence. I would expect BSL interpretation or closed captioning for the Government briefings. Have we not had an Equality Act since 2010? Recently the BSL interpreters seem to appear more frequently, and that is good. Sometimes I find their communication clearer than that of the politicians. Gradual opening up of society and the economy is really important now, but other countries have a reallyclearschedule/timetabletodoso. ForexampleIlookedattheIrishgovernment’sfull-pager in the Irish Times and was immediately clear about what was likely to happen, when, still accepting that if the unexpected happened the schedule could flex. Work and home life I know that many, many others have real worries about money and jobs and think a major employment programme of some kind to support young adults will be necessary. All the volunteering activities I have been doing since I retired (the local museum and library, the heritage project in the village, bellringing) have shut down for the time being, although groups have quickly developed online alternatives. That has been okay. My wife has been working from home. She is a mental health support worker, so is speaking to clients by phone, email and text. After a stressful couple of weeks initially, that now seems to be working well. Given the choice I think she would prefer not to go back to a cramped and busy office. Technology I was already familiar with online conferencing from my former workplace. In the past weeks it has really been about using more modern systems, all of which seem to be pretty much the same. However friends who are teachers and who are using this kind of tech for the first time really don’t like it. I’m not particularly tech-y: I just had a few years’ start. I’ve participated in a few online meetings (committees, volunteer meetings and so on) and enjoyed yoga classes led by my usual teacher on Zoom. She seems to have moved very smoothly to the new format. We have been keeping in touch with friends and family. We have used Whatsapp, Zoom, texting, email and old fashioned postcards and letters. At first it seems odd to be doing this with friends who live around the corner, but the strangeness wore off quite quickly. I have really enjoyed having enough time to write a proper email or letter. We have two new great-nephews and quantities of baby spam arrive daily: that has been lovely. My sister in Belfast and I have been reading the same books and talking about them. For example we have both loved Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light (suitably sized for a long lockdown). It has been a total luxury for me to read for at least an hour or two every day: other than holidays I haven’t been able to do that for decades and have tried a lot of authors new to me – James Meek, Maggie O’Farrell, Donna Leon, Tove Jansson, Elizabeth Strout, Marilynne Robinson, Eugene McCabe, Natalia Ginzburg. A neighbour has lent us a pile of DVDs so we have also been catching up on films we have never seen. I’m not an enthusiast of social media although do have almost dormant accounts for the usual platforms. Ihaven’tusedFacebookmuchforyears,butamfindingitusefulnow: for example there are several groups for bellringers. Some bellringers at Harvard university have developed software which simulates ringing bells in teams and so allows people to take advantage of the lockdown to practise and learn. I’ve had a couple of attempts at using the software with friends. Shopping and food Shopping has been odd. Neither of us is very happy to shop face to face at the moment, even though it is probably less risky than we think. Although vulnerable, my wife doesn’t qualify for priority deliveries to the completely housebound advertised by the supermarkets. Shopping, including hunting down collection slots or items in stock has become a boring new hobby for me. My fantasy is that ‘afterwards’ I won’t bother to shop at all but just have everything delivered, like my mother in the 1950s. But I’mnot surewecouldaffordit. We have taken to having milk, yoghurt and a fruit and veg box delivered each week, but we still need supermarkets and chemists. I don’t like the anxious atmosphere that pervades the queues outside shops at the moment and I really don’t like being around people who are not even trying to distance physically. The allotment is fine and feels really safe, but we can’t live off kale all the time. For many years I have cooked meals from scratch and I enjoy occasional baking. So far I have managed to keep a supply of flour and yeast for baking (just about). The main challenge has been to plan meals in advance: I have discovered that I am really terrible at doing this. There is no room for error: forgetting to order the eggs has consequences. Personal hygiene I live in casual clothes with a couple of presentable outfits for when I am giving tours or doing other public-facing volunteering. That hasn’t changed, though I am surprised at how much I miss the nudge to smarten up a bit, even just a few times a week. I haven’t yet needed to take the scissors to my own hair, thought that time may come. It has just become a little less short. Neither E nor I dye our hair and so we are just staying grey and curly and a bit wild. Neither of us goes in for manicures or facials so we can say in truth that we are no scruffier than usual. That feels fine. We have made some smart face coverings from spare cotton fabric: so far I have worn mine twice, on the bus and in a shop. I now feel less selfconscious but my spectacles still mist up. The main difference has been the regular handwashing and cleaning/sanitising the house. thought that I used to do handwashing well, but nothing like this. However much cream I put on them my hands stay dry and cracked. I have always hated housework and cleaning but push myself into an hour’s cleaning and sanitising every day whether I feel like it or not. Usually, I don’t feel like it. The house doesn’t really look cleaner: the shabby areas are just easier to see. And who would have thought that we would be washing the shopping? Sleeping My sleep has been okay in the past weeks, neither better nor worse than usual. I have been hoping for vivid Covid dreams, but sadly haven’t had any."

Being a good and safe weight and having a good level of physical rest, sleep and exercise.  Having access to a good, well balanced diet and drinking plenty of fluids. Wellbeing means having a good level of wellness both physical and mental and having good levels of happiness and contentment. It is about being comfortable with who you are and able to cope with the challenges of life and adapt to the inevitable changes that are part of life. For me a healthy body is neither too overweight nor too thin. We are shown images of bodies so skinny that they look emaciated and are skin and bone.  As much as obesity is a serious threat to health I don’t believe that a size zero body is healthy either. My five words are Rosie Nourished Relaxed Firm Energised I don’t feel that any one person or image encapsulates a healthy body; it is such an individual thing. Identity Growing up in a middle class family has without doubt helped me to understand a good balanced diet and the importance of learning to cook. I never buy junk food or ready meals; we all learned to cook with our Grand Mothers and Mum and good food was never in short supply. In terms of ethnicity or sexual orientation these have had no bearing whatsoever on my experience of health. My gender has impacted on my health because I have suffered from dreadfully heavy and painful periods from the age of 15 until I finally hit the Menopause at 54. The Menopause has caused weight gain but otherwise has been a blessed relief. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I was at school in the 60’s and 70’s and apart from PE there was no health education at all, and there was no such word as wellbeing at that time. I first became aware of “health” in my 20’s when it was talked about more on TV and in magazines.  However, wellbeing is a word that I have had no awareness of until the last few years, and now it seems to be everywhere, especially online. I believe that access to the internet has opened up a whole world of information and advice.  We have access to experts in every possible field now. When I was younger my Mum took care of us and looked after our health, when I was 15 she died and then my Dad and Aunt looked after me. Health was not really something that was talked about in the family.  I talked to Mum about period problems and if I was unwell but there was no talk of health in general.  After Mum died I did not really talk about my health or mental health issues. There was no health education in school at any time, there was no real health education information that I was aware of until I was much older, and then that was in books and magazines and was something that I became very interested in. When I finally got access to the internet 11 years ago that opened a whole amazing world of information and learning that I wish had been available when I was young. Key moments I first became aware of puberty when my periods started which would have been about 1975 when I was 12.  I can’t remember when the outward physical changes occurred but I do remember Mum taking me to be measured for my first bra and of course all the girls at school comparing breast size. I don’t believe that any of these moments are especially important, they are simply part of life and growing up, but I do think that good support and advice especially with periods and hormonal changes is vital to youngsters. By the time I was 15 I was having dreadfully heavy and painful periods, something that was to be a problem until I got to the Menopause. They were debilitating and often affected work life and sometimes put me to bed for 2 days.  Doctors simply told you that it would get better when you had children, which as a gay female with no intention of having offspring was futile and utterly useless. Funnily enough though, talking to a friend a few years ago who suffered the same problem as me, she had been told the same thing and having had two children said that it did not improve things one iota, “they just told us that to fob us off”. Growing older I am afraid that I have not been terribly good at looking after my health. I changed from decades of very hard physical work to a very sedentary job in 2001. I gave up smoking in 2003 which caused a substantial weight gain, way more that the “just 3lb’s” my GP told me I’d gain. A great deal of work related stress has led to comfort eating and too much alcohol at times and the Menopause has brought another big weight gain.  So I am now very overweight. Hip dysplasia and the pain of arthritis & back damage impacts heavily on my ability to exercise. I do eat a good balanced diet & drink far less now but my love of sugar causes an ongoing battle. My mental health was poor in my teens and after my Mums death it spiralled and I struggled with depression and mental health problems for many years. Since my 40’s my mental health has vastly improved and I am now very content and happy. I have a stressful job but now have a good work life balance and am able to switch off when I leave the office. I have learned to accept what can’t be changed. I don’t watch news programmes or negative TV, so that means I watch very little TV at all.  I also will not follow any negative social media. I admit that I take much better care of my mental health than I do my physical health. Finding somewhere that I can exercise or go for a walk and then getting there is difficult unless I get a bus which I am not happy to do currently. I use a light box which has vastly decreased if not eradicated any depression.  A breakdown when I was 43 caused me to look for ways to change my mental outlook for the better, which was when I stopped looking at the news and negative TV.  I learned about being present, about gratitude practices, and acceptance.  I discovered NLP through Paul McKenna and have used and built on this in the years following. I get a lot of information now on line and very much enjoy doing courses on wellness & positive psychology.  I do also still love to buy and read books too. I am more aware of my body now, I think because I am older and my weight gain is hard to ignore.  I have a lot of aches and pains in my joints because of previous injuries and age but also because I am bearing much more weight than I should do.  I can’t do what I used to be able to do which at 57 is both telling and frustrating. I very much want to get my weight down and a recent diagnosis of Gallstones may well help with that as it impacts on my ability to eat many of the bad foods.  I also need to sort out a good way to exercise at home AND make time for it every day. Health, wellbeing and appearance If we are healthy and have a good sense of wellbeing it shows outwardly because we are more radiant. We will be a good weight and if exercising or having an active lifestyle will be trimmer. We will be more confident because we can dress the way we want and feel good in the clothes and in our bodies. We will have a healthy pallor and be more vibrant and alive.  A healthy person has way more energy so it’s a knock on effect. I have never been influenced by popular ideals at all. I pay no attention to it and have never been a dedicated follower of fashion. My Mum and Dad grew up in a time when people made an effort and it was normal to be well dressed and turned out. They ran a business and socialised a lot so were always well dressed and took a pride in their appearance, in fact they were well dressed even when they were casually dressed. I don’t use any beauty products at all; I take good supplements of vitamins and minerals only, to help me to stay well. I would not like to stop taking them. They would be my desert island must have. Getting ready to leave the house I remember well Mum and Dad getting ready to go to the shop. Mum would spend time on her hair and makeup and would always look lovely, whatever the day or occasion. Dad would shave and tidy his moustache and sideburns. He would always go to the shop or a social evening in a suit and tie.  They would both always wear scent, Mum Tweed and Dad Old Spice after shave. If they were going out for an evening do, then there would be the addition of a long soak in a Fenjal bath, a smell that I still love. They would look so smart and lovely & Mum would wear earrings and other sparkly costume jewellery.  They definitely made more of an effort than people do now. I wear a smart blouse and trousers to work but it is extremely rare that I go out anywhere socially that requires me to dress up.  In fact I would feel uncomfortable if I had to as I don’t enjoy those kinds of gathering. I am a happy introvert now so over time I have lessened my socialising a great deal, as a result I don’t have to worry about dressing up for dinner."

To be, or have a healthy body conjures the following: Not obese, unbroken, firm.  I must confess there are not particular images that spring to mind.  My wife is an admirer of Michael Antonio, West Ham centre forward:  He has a nice pair of legs (muscular) and is remarkably toned, but he has to be it’s his job to be fit. Health and well being as concepts have unequivocally changed in the past year, mental health is everywhere, at least the concerns for it. A healthy body is ever more not one full of prosecco, but one spending an age on a spin bike.  These days of lock down and restriction health and exercise of both the body and soul/mind are on an equal footing.  Tonight, the news concerned itself with the mental health of up to 600,000 workers who may need support for things as severe as PTSD. Identity Given I spent most of my 20’s in pubs I would suspect that social class and gender were contributing factors, as well as age. There were no men’s mental or physical health programs, or periodicals, where and when I grew up (no Men’s Health magazine for example).  You were either fat, or not; could hold your booze, or not.  Well, being is a different concept and again this has changed over time, at least our ability to talk about it. If I am honest it brings me down.  I miss stoicism and people ‘getting on with it’. Safe spaces (where you can/can’t talk about things, I think) didn’t exist until recently. I didn’t have to worry about toxic masculinity or my mental health in public and at work.  There has to be a balance and I fear we’ve gone the wrong way.  Perhaps because of how and where I was raised -in a working-class environment and I am in my late 40’s.  I’m sure my children would think differently to me, I know they do. They have dedicated lessons at school on mental and social health as well as gender discussions that would have frightened me at their age.  I think this is a positive for them in a more connected, un guarded connected world. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing No one talked about health when I was young, with the exception perhaps of dental hygiene.  We were taught good road safety and don’t go off with strangers, but no one told me a sugar sandwich was bad and I should exercise more. I suspect my diet was an abomination O4521 given how I grew up (loved absolutely – well nourished, not particularly).  I recall nothing at school, not even in-home economics classes, where I’m sure we only baked cakes and apple pies (though I cannot corroborate this). I suspect it’s only really been in the last 15 years or so that I have become more aware of my own health and that of others, perhaps because mortality stares me in the face sooner than in my youth.  Given our lock down/COVID-19 experiences – as noted above health both physically and mentally have risen to the fore.  8 years ago, I took the decision to lose wight and I have managed to keep some of it off.  This was the first time I made a concerted effort to lose weight and get fitter.  I ate better, drank less booze and exercised more and in a year, I lost over 3 stone in weight.  (I’ve put half of it back, but I have only the one chin now). Key moments Bodily changes happened to me when I was about 13, I remember with both immense pride and curiosity the events of puberty admiring one, then two, then many hairs in two locations.  I don’t recall that my voice ever broke and I was not particularly hirsute. My first ever shave was at 16 in 1990, on holiday in county Mayo, Ireland, in my cousin’s grandmothers house – with his razor.  The water was brown, because it was pumped from a well and I used a green and white towel to dry my top lip off post event – odd that I can remember it now.  It was quite exciting so much so we bought my first razor there, which I had for years.  30+ years later and I still only shave every other day, I will never be able to grow a full beard. Growing older I suspect I am more body aware now, because over the years it has been broken, expanded and contracted, sun burnt and squeezed.  I have never really worried about it, as noted above, with the one exception where I lost 3 stone, but even then, I took my time to lose the weight and not focus on only the weight loss. Over the years I have become more sedentary.  As a youth I rode a bike everywhere and I was a decent fair-weather cyclist in my 30’s doing 15 miles a day.  I played football regularly and enjoyed other sports.  Now I just about manage a 20-minute stroll around the village.  Recreational walking is something we have undertaken considerably more through the pandemic, including may 6–10-mile walks but these are leisurely and I think more attributable to mental than physical health.  Football and indeed all sport is no more due to physical aliments caused as a result of injury – broken bones, torn ligaments, and many dislocations. Health, wellbeing and appearance Hair styles is the nearest I have been influenced by physical beauty, but I have crap hair, so even when I wanted a ‘flat-top’ in the 1980’s (when I was a teenager) I couldn’t have one because even with a ton of hair spray my hair wouldn’t stick up uniformly. My mother loved a pair of curlers, so I suspect this is also the nearest she came to being influenced by physical beauty.  Though thinking about it she did paint her nails, I can remember the smell. O4521 I love a shaving brush and roll-on deodorant.  Most of all I’d take nail clippers with me to a desert island. Not sure if this makes me a slave to beauty products, or pragmatic. Getting ready to leave the house My Father left when I was 6ish, alas I don’t remember his ritual for work. I know he got up early an drove a blue van, but not much else. My mother worked sporadically I don’t recall that she had any work-related rituals either. As it relates to my own work routine there is life before COVID-19 19 and life after where work is concerned.  This last year (post March 2020 and 2021 now). I rise about 7.30am unload the dish washer, bottom drawer first; feed the dog, eat a bread-based breakfast (favouring crumpets at the moment, two of – are they bread?); read the Guardian on line, just to see what the imbecile Trump has been up to – only a few days left before he’s gone from office; wake the children up; admire them; mooch off to my garden office at 08.46 with a bottle of water and a black coffee, usually.  The garden office is 20 metres away at the bottom of our back garden. When the children are at attending school (not locked down) I would wake 30 minutes earlier and prepare packed lunches: A sandwich, some fruit -usually grapes; a drink; crisps and a chocolate snack for each of them. Rituals have changed over time, of course, particularly as we became parents of school age children.  Prior to that sometimes we wouldn’t wake up until 8am and then head off to work after pottering about the house for a few minutes, work was never more than 6 miles away so we had this luxury. I find myself eating less cereal these days and never a hot breakfast on a week day.  Whilst I have worked around Cambridge, I have never really worked in it, so there was no after work ritual of a quick beer for us as we were all out of town. I miss the pub."

Mass-Observer gives MO code as 04521 rather than O4521.,"MO Number: 04521  Sex: Male  Age: 46  Marital Status: Married  Location: Cambridge, UK  Directive:  Summer 2020/No.119    Part 1: Covid19 and Time    Rhythm and routine of the day    Homelife    There are no explicit distinctions between times of day.  There are tacit ones, driven by tangible events, such as before school, after school and dinner.  Dinner is a variable, the others not.  I have tried to book time in my calendar for lunch, though this is varied in quality and duration.  Most are into the house for a sandwich and back to the desk.  Through October there were a few lunches out with my wife.  This section has been compiled after the ‘Waiting’ section below, which I have not edited.    My work takes priority, over the internet connection and space in the house, I am the only income of the household (by choice) and I have been seen to be a little prissy when conference calls have been ruined by my children playing bandwidth hungry games between 4 and 6pm.    Depending on new lockdowns (today is November 2nd, we have a one month one that begins on Thursday, but children continue to school) I suspect in our household we have made the adjustments we need, as it relates to space and access to technology.  I have moved to our garden office/gym/outside space, which has internet, so I am a little isolated, in my own bubble.    Time in general is ruled by school, work and children’s recreational activities.  During the earlier lockdown evenings were our own again with do need to ferry children about.  This has returned, until this week, where we have needed to be a little more organised.    I’ve noticed I shave less, and I wear more informal clothes than I would have done prior to COVID-19.  I have worn jeans and shorts through all of march to today (Nov 2nd).  I suspect my trousers and shirts will go under utilised until a return to the office.        04521 Due to work projects I took to booking personal time between 6 and 9pm to protect some personal time through June – September, this wasn’t very successful, but I can state that work did take all the time allocated to it, and more.  Things have slackened off a little now, thankfully.    Media and technology    There have been a few mundane changes in our household.  Primarily we switched to ‘click and collect’ shopping from our local supermarket.  We had not done so until this year and I’m pleased that the service exists.  Supermarkets are essentially the breeding ground for science experiments and extinction of the stupid experiments.  No rules, limited decorum and overwhelmed, yet well intended staff.  Click and collect allowed for orders to be made on line and picked up without entering the store, thus reducing human contact.      We have also bolstered our household technology through online purchases.  I have ordered equipment for the children and my own ‘office environment’ a space that did not exist before lockdown.  Most of it will retain use for years, so it’s not money wasted in my opinion.    The growth of collaborative platforms such as Zoom should be recognised and Zoom is quickly becoming the common noun (and verb) for video conferencing.  The first product to become a sector noun since Google became the verb for internet search.  I have zoomed with friends and we have deployed the technology to our village football club allowing us to have virtual monthly meetings.  This is a first in the 20 years the club has existed, in fact we are sticking with it for now.  The technology works well and to that end I am grateful for it.      Waiting    Thankfully nor I and those dear to me have been unwell as a result of this madness.  However, on a personal note life absolutely feels like it’s been put on hold. I have put off and found myself waiting for many things.    Dentist:  My original check-up was for march this year; I have a check-up once every nine months.  This has thankfully been rescheduled to September the 14th, so it will be 15 months since I’ve had my teeth checked.  As it happens, I think they are ok, nothing to report.    Nov 2nd.  The above turned out not to be true.  I needed a filling in my lower left 7.  This was a fete of major engineering on the part of my dentist.  The check-up and the     04521  filling were performed in an environment a heart surgeon would have felt familiar in.  The controls to access the surgery, including waiting in the car, a temperature check, signing two wavers and cleaning hands twice before sitting down insured: 1, I was probably safe and 2, not going to take this anything but seriously.  That I needed a filling upset me greatly.  Back in the chair 2 weeks later after the check up for 45 minutes was not where I wanted to be.  Kudos to the dentist and the wider staff, they were lovely.    Haircut:  I had my last haircut first week of March.  This will be the longest I have gone without a haircut possibly ever.  I think I look like Don Johnson in the US ‘cop show’ Miami Vice, a hit in the 80’s.  My wife thinks I look like a cross of Robert Peston (political commentator) and Jarvis Cocker (singer in pop band Pulp).  Neither is particularly complementary.  I might get my hair cut tomorrow (Aug 29th).  It is long.  I have adopted a curtain look, way too much grey and the hair on the back of my head is starting to flail about.    It should be noted that I did manage a haircut a week later it took years off me and my wife talked to me more.  I will not repeat this follicle escapade again.  I will ask for clippers this Christmas to keep the hair on my head in check for the remainder of COVID-19 life    Eating/drinking out:  Not done so since February, so 6 months.  I have no desire to eat in a restaurant either, the experience would be too strange for me and why do I need a mask in a shop, but not a food retailer, it makes no sense.    Travel:  I have not been on a plane for nearly 11 months (now 13), the longest time since 1997.  I have not been to London since January, the longest since 1990.  I took a day’s holiday on Monday, the first this year, probably the longest time since 1997.  We went to the seas side – Wells-net-to-the-sea, in Norfolk.  The town was mobbed, I queued 30 minutes for the car park ticket machine, everyone was pretty relaxed about it.  This is the first daytrip we have had since October last year.    General info:  Village life has changed, we have all queued for many things, including access to shops, which I would not expect normally where we live.  Queues and masks have challenged many, me included.  I have seen queues run for 100’s of metres in the formative weeks of lock down to enter our village co-op.  They’ve mostly gone now, though the smaller shops, with greater restrictions on numbers still have them – our green grocers will only take 3 customers in the shop at any time and our butchers 4.    Work:  This has not stopped, we switched to home working and this will continue into the new year, so 9 months at least.  To that end I have not worked from my employer’s office for 9 months.  I don’t miss this, our environment was poor, open plan, noisy, presenteeism based.  I do miss contact with those whose company I enjoyed and not in my immediate sphere of interaction."

Well-being is something a bit more new age and tends towards the emotional and mental health of a person. Harder to measure I think but no less important. A healthy body, in my eyes, is someone walking upright and so looking healthy. A smile on the face, a normal weight, some muscle and clearly someone who takes a certain pride in their appearance. I am not sure I have a perfect person in my mind but probably I am impressed with an adult male who can run a mile without thinking about it but also be flexible enough to bend and do a handstand. Certainly not me although this is the person I aspire to be. I think for my gender, male, society prods me in the direction of being slim, tending towards having that triangle back – so, broad shoulders tapering to a slim waist. I am not really that shape although I think that I would be seen as more healthy, by others, if I was that shape. Ethnicity? Well I am a bit of a mixed race and I think my genes give me some grace in that If I keep on top of my diet then I tend towards slim-ish. Social Class? I suppose I would be encouraged to go to the gym a lot, be seen to be exercising or at least jogging. I don’t really like gyms at all. Far too social and forced. I have always liked cycling, certainly before it was trendy. I have a very untrendy bike with a big box on the back. A lot of my friends, in the same social class, will cycle for fitness but make extra journeys to do so. I just cycle to get from A to B or, more so now, walk everywhere. a lot of people think I am very poor as I walk but I enjoy it a lot more than driving, or indeed, cycling. Sexual orientation? No idea what that is driving at. I am a straight male and I don’ think my sexual orientation would make me exercise any differently. I think my social class has been the biggest driver for the amount of exercise (or lack of it) taken. Without really knowing it I think my family was relatively healthy but not necessarily in a positive way. My mother was always on some sort of diet and this meant that as a family we were always eating ‘healthy food’ before there was really a trend for it. It wasn’t very nice though. One of my abiding memories from home was a roast dinner but the roast potatoes were cooked not in goose fat, nor dripping, not even in sunflower oil. No, they were cooked in lemon juice and they tasted as if they were cooked in Lemon Juice. Anaemic in colour and in taste. We rarely had sweets or chocolate and it probably did me a world of good. We also rarely had fizzy drinks either. Steaks, as well, were an issue. We really didn’t go out to eat and so if we were to have steak then my mother would buy these tiny bits of meat (latterly I found out that these were ‘minute’ steaks) but these would be grilled, and grilled for about 20 minutes until they were on the point of cremation. They were painful to eat but, in my mind, that was steak. When I first met up with my girlfriend (latterly to be my wife) and her family, she said that her mother was going to cook up Steak and Chips. She apologized before hand as it would be nothing special. In my mind I was girding myself to have to suffer eating shoe leather and then have to be polite about it. So when this piece of meat appeared on my plate, and as I cut into it, red inside and then tasting it so soft and tender, I really didn’t know what to think. Actually what I was thinking was, what had I been eating for most of my life as now everything I was gong to eat was ‘normal’ i.e. food with butter instead of ghastly, margarine based cooking. I also tasted ice cream for the first time, made of cream. It was as if the scales had fallen from my taste buds. Those few years after I ‘discovered’ all of this new food I probably ate more than I should but I got a bit bigger, but not much. I can’t think that either of my parents had a ‘chat’ to me about health...ever. I think because I was sort of healthy, ran about a lot, was usually very slim, to the point of thinness. I suppose I could have done more, and different sports but I played tennis and table tennis. One bar to doing sports (seems pathetic now) is that I have always been very short sighted. I did do judo ( I was pretty good) but hated swimming, really hated it. Not the swimming itself but the fact I could not see very much and the idea of plasters and hair EVERYWHERE!! I don’t think I ever had the chat about health with anyone, not even at school, was because I was pretty healthy and I think it was assumed that I was. Certainly nothing at all at school about mental health. Stiff upper lip and all that. I can’t remember there being a school counsellor and I don’t think I would have gone to see one if there was. But then I really didn’t experience any great trauma. No-one died during my upbringing but I was often told by my parents that I should just get on with things and worrying was time wasted. I usually picked myself up and carried on. I can’t say that this has done me much harm. Regarding being aware of any bodily changes associated with puberty, you know, I am thinking about it but I really have very little in the way of memories. I know that I was very late physically growing up so I was usually one of the smallest in the class. I also remember having a lot of spots on my face. After the usual ‘rash’ of various face creams, ointments and the like my mother took me to the doctors and I got some antibiotics for my face. I can’t say they did very much, so that was very miserable. I also had big braces on my teeth for about 5 years. So not overly attractive to the opposite sex. I genuinely cannot remember shaving for the first time, I really can’t! My father certainly wouldn’t have helped but I do remember getting a ‘shaving kit’ one Christmas, full of awful ‘Insignia’ shaving foam spray and aftershave. Even that young I could tell the smell was animal repellent. I do remember shaving was had no direction at all. And, again, it really didn’t help that I was very short sighted and so, very early on, probably at 16 ish I started shaving in the shower. I would (and still do) use those Bic razors which have a strip of aloe lubrication on them and I shave with the hot water in the shower. I shave by feel, and the hot water in the shower makes it a much closer shave. I really hate shaving though and during the holidays I will always let my facial hair grow for as long as I can get away with (that said, it is now very white and very ageing, so when I finally shave it off it makes me look very youthful) I don’t have very happy memories of my adolescence and therefore I don’t remember it very well. Sorry. I think, over the years, I have been very lucky with my health. My appetite isn’t huge and I seem to have a sort of ‘mental brake’ when it comes to eating. If I feel I have eaten enough over a few days than my body really rejects eating. I will spend at least the same amount of time eating very lightly and doing a lot more exercise. Sometimes I am not conscious of this happening. It will begin, I think, by just drinking a lot more water which in turn slows my eating right down. I tend to live my life with the watch word being ‘moderation’. My mind does go a bit berserk if I don’t have projects or ideas ‘on the go’. These have been, sort of, the same things over the years and I suppose they are things that people would put on lists of ‘wellbeing’ targets. But genuinely, they are things I enjoy doing and would choose to do them. So, I think it was about 1998 my wife got a book on origami, Unit Origami to be precise and essentially it is just folding small bits of paper, the same way, over and over again and once you have enough pieces you make them in to very big models. She found it a little boring and I was hooked. I don’t do it all the time but when I do it it is very calming. I make little bits and leave them all over the city. It is something you have to concentrate on really hard, but for short periods of time. I also read a lot. I usually try to read over 40 books a year (that is my target and I usually meet it). It is usually paper books and nothing digital. And again, it is something that has to be concentrated on. I have also tried to learn languages. I am not very good at this but I do try. Also, when I am out walking (I walk a lot – this is another thing, I tend to walk about 6-7 miles a day) I will have a little poem on a piece of paper in my pocket and I will memorize it as I go. This, I feel, is very good for my memory, well-being and mental abilities. I will also do as many crosswords (cryptic) as I can. I am not bad but certainly not fantastic. I can usually finish the Telegraph Crosswords most days but it takes me a while to do. I also play the piano and this coming year I want to have 10 classical pieces at my fingertips. Again, not very good but...it is the journey. And, as I said, I do a lot of walking but not much else in the way of exercise and this is something that is lacking. So every year, my new years resolution is to do proper exercise every day. I know what I should be doing, of course. At 40 I had one of those evaluations at the GP surgery, just to check my health. Hurrah, I was still alive but I was ever so slightly in the overweight range (literally one pound) and also my cholesterol level was in the upper normal range. So, essentially I was health but still the GP’s nag and so I decided to go on a diet, mainly cutting out everything that was processed, eating less but eating well and mainly vegetables. I lost one and a half stones. I received lots of very positive feedback from people, ‘how well I looked’ but (and I think it was over a year and a bad Christmas, the weight went back on. And OK, fine and so last year I simply decided that I was going to do exactly the same thing and ‘simply’ lose the weight and keep it off. Except this time it didn’t work. Perhaps it was to do with lockdown (far too much sourdough bread – which needed tasting) and much less movement. I can feel now that there is weight to lose. I don’t feel happy when I am just little heavy. I also get lots of little aches and pains. I know that as I get older it will be much harder to shift the weight so, again, in 2021 I will endeavour to lose that weight and get back to something much healthier. I think I am slightly more aware of my body know than I was if only to keep checking it, seeing if anything has dropped off during the night. I started losing my hair at about 21 so I really don’t worry about my ‘looks’ but, in the sun I wear a hat, put on some cream. I moisturise a bit. One really good thing I have bought recently (after much nagging from my dentist) was an electric toothbrush. It is life changing and I think my dentist will be so pleased with how well my teeth look since the last appointment. I think it is important to look after your body as it does belong to me and I don’t want to have to rely on doctors or pills all the time. My face, appearance has changed very little over the last 30 or so years, apart from my hair almost disappearing although I have usually shaved my head so really I haven’t changed very much at all! I don’t think I am very influenced by others for my appearance but my wife will say I am. I tend to wear very practical things and at my age I genuinely do not care how people see me or perceive me. I do think fragrance is important and I do like wearing nice cologne. I suppose some people might think my dress sense a little eccentric (stripey socks, red shoes etc) so be it. Makes me happy anyway. Of course, saying this, I really can’t think of my parents being influenced in any way by fashion. Beauty products? Well, the cologne (which I could live without as it is a total extravagance) I like a number of Diptique smells but also Acqua di Parma is very nice. I sometimes use Bulldog face moisturizer just to put on my hands and face, to keep them from being very dry. I always keep a small tube of Norwegian formula hand cream. All this ‘alcohol gel’ makes my hands very dry. But, genuinely, could do without it all so if I was on an actual desert island I would have a big old tub of moisturizer cream with a bit of SPF. My mother had a big old dressing table but never spent too much time there. All I remember her doing was a quick go with the face cream, a bit of powder, lipstick and a spray with some (pretty dreadful) scent. My father, even less although he had (and still has at 75) a full head of hair and will spend an inordinate time combing his hair. He has some cologne but if I looked in his drawer today I am sure I would find the same bottles (pretty much unused) that I bought for him 20 or so years ago. He just doesn’t use them. I thought scent was a real indulgence until my wife bought me some very nice cologne. I wore it and, the smell, really makes you feel like a grown up. You start acting differently and then people act differently to you. My own routine getting ready for work? Not changed a bit. Always a very hot shower, hot to the point of the skin going pink. The ten seconds of ice cold water. That wakes you up. If I need a shave I will do that in the shower (as mentioned). Then, roll on deodorant. It has no fragrance. If it is just a very bring day I might wear 1447 which is a very nice cologne but doesn’t last too long – but very reasonably priced. I like the smell but my wife doesn’t. A good day and then I’ll put on a nicer cologne. Then, dress, watch on, put moisturizer on if needed. Then go back into the bathroom and clean teeth. It never changes. I barely ever see my face in the mirror and nor do I wish to!!!"

My wife works at the local hospital and has therefore been going to work there everyday. When she comes in she will first wash her hands thoroughly and then change her clothes. A few weeks ago my youngest son, E, had a temperature which is not uncommon with small boys however he also had this very raspy cough. So, as my wife is a Keyworker at the hospital she had to firstly phone them up for advice about what to do as E was showing signs of Covid19. This meant that she was not able to go in for work on that day. We also phoned up the 111 service to check what to do. A slot was booked for my wife to take E to a carpark near the hospital where in a drive by testing young E had a swab thrust to the back of his throat. Apparently the nurse who did it was very nice and professional. We then gave E paracetamol to keep his temperature down but his temperature was raised for about 8 days. It was therefore assumed, from the off, that E had Covid19 and we should all isolate in the house for 14 days. Unfortunately the test had somehow been lost and we never found out the result. The lady from HR at the hospital said that E was a false negative and she was sure that E had the disease. After 8 days his temperature came down but his cough was still persistent. More interestingly there are 4 other people in the house, none of which showed any symptoms of the disease, myself included. We were in very close proximity to E so it is very likely that we have had the disease but are asymptomatic. We would very much like to know if we have antibodies for the virus but currently unlikely to know for sometime although it would be very helpful as it would mean I could go back to my job of teacher without fear of picking up the disease. The Government, in my mind, has been almost clueless. They have been so busy trying to be seen to do the right thing and this has got in the way of actually doing the right thing. Now we are finding out that their strategy right at the beginning was very poor. They did not put people into lock down right away and because of that, so many more people have died than needed to. They have veered from chaotic to abysmal. Only in the last few days, still thinking about Brexit, and still do not want certain people here in Britain even though the NHS is made up of an awful lot of migrants that they want to see the back of. It is appalling, clapping the NHS on one night and the next plotting to get rid of as many migrants (NHS workers) as possible. The government also don’t seem to have a clue about how to get us out of this situation whilst at the same time very much patronising the whole of the UK and treating us like non-thinking idiots. It is just awful and frightening that such clowns are in charge. I very much hope that they will announce in the coming months that they are all dreadful and they are going to resign. News At the beginning I have to admit that I was gobbling down the news voraciously. There was so much information. I usually listened to the BBC 4 news programme at 5 (PM) and then I would have to watch the Ten O’clock News on the BBC. It became almost compulsive to listen for how many people had died in Italy, in Spain and these terrible stories and then the looming prospect of it all arriving on our shores like a tsunami. I remember watching the government briefings and I would watch the whole things. And then it was questions by screen and it was quite addictive. But then, what really scared me, was looking in the eyes of these ministers and you could see that they really had no idea what they were doing. They were trotting out the same old platitudes day after day and no-one was really holding them to account. I stopped watching them on the TV as they just were telling so many lies, about the numbers of tests and so on. I do not know of anyone who has had challenges accessing the news. I think, generally the opposite is the problem i.e. getting away from the news. I think the BBC has come into its own with being a trusted media outlet. I believe that they have had record viewing figures. I also certainly think that a BSL signer should be available for briefings, perhaps on a digital channel at the same time? Work and Lockdown I have been working but my job is very student facing that it is difficult to do the job at home. When we first went into lockdown I did have a lot of paperwork that I took back home and, still eking it out, finished it all in the first couple of weeks. I have asked my manager many times but it appears that I am on standby. It is possible because I told work that I would have to be at home looking after my children as my wife would be working at the hospital. The college where I work has been closed for the duration. As I write this it is the ninth week of lockdown. We all barely leave the house. So for nine weeks I have been in charge of the home schooling and it is lucky that I am a teacher. I am secretly sure that my kids hate this fact. I think they did originally and for the first two or three weeks there was a lot of resistance to me doing all of the teaching but certainly now, in the ninth week, we have all got into a groove and routine is certainly the key to surviving the virus lockdown. Every day we go out into our little courtyard garden and do exercise for about half an hour. It is usually quite a punishing routine and it is certainly more exercise than I was used to. We do HIIT exercises, skipping, push-up competitions but I try to mix it up through the week. It is probably the barest minimum but it is keeping us ticking over. Then, at about 10 am the children log on to various wi fi devices and depending whether they need to use a computer or not depends on what they use. All of the schools that they go to have Google Class rooms set up and the week is set of the week but everyday they download the activities. You can print it out but you don’t have to. Also you do not have to do the work on line but tell the teacher that the work was written in the home book. The work is very varied but very much relies on access to the internet. The children are also looking at Bitesize on the BBC for very entertaining lessons. We tend to access that on the Smart TV (someone had to show me how to do that!). We usually stop for lunch at about one, which I tend to make. We have done a bit of baking, bread and cakes. Then at 2 we do another hour or so. I tend to read a story out loud for them for about 15 minutes. I think they like that time together. After about 3 ish, depending on how hard people have worked, we stop school work and the children are allowed to do what they want. I can then start any work that I might need to do! It has worked well and I think my relationship with my children is getting better. I think they see me, perhaps, as a bit of a more rounded parent than before. Technology In the first couple of weeks my work had decided to have lots of meetings through Google Hangouts. It was just ghastly. People interrupting all the time and it was still the same old people doing all of the talking. Pointless. I don’t go to them any more. I haven’t been fired yet but I am not sure anyone has noticed that I am missing from the meetings! Fortunately my parents are complete technophobes and are not able to contact me through the computer. They do send e-mails and there is the odd phone call. Early on I did have to tell them off as they kept going out. One thing that has been good is having my book group on Zoom. All the people in the group (apart from me!) is quite old but they are very tech savvy. It is not perfect but we do meet at the right time, we all have a glass of wine in our hands and the talk is very good. I really don’t like the long pauses and I find you just have to keep talking over people because of the gap. It is not perfect but it is better than not having the meeting. I think the older members really value it. Shopping and Food Well, at the beginning it was agreed, because my wife was going out to work anyway then she would do all of the shopping. I went once, to Tesco right at the beginning if only to get a few sheets of toilet roll. It was a very eerie experience. Since the first week my wife, being an NHS worker, was able to go at special slots and so shopping was not too horrendous and we have been able to get pretty much what we needed. That said, having told off her parents and older aunts and uncles who, because of their age had to completely isolate, well they had no way of getting shopping. At first they were a bit reticent and really didn’t want to trouble us. Now, nine weeks in, they are phoning all the bloody time and, if I may say, being very picky about what food they want. Square crumpets, and not the Tesco ones but the Warburtons ones if you please! So my wife goes on a Sunday morning, with their separate list of shopping and then she drives 20 odd miles to give it to them. I suppose it is a way to keep in contact. recently my wife has been able to use click and collect for us which she says is much better. I do feel a little guilty not having done any sort of shopping for about 10 weeks but also it has stopped me buying loads of rubbish that I would have otherwise bought. We have enough flour and we have actually been baking some bread. Some of it successful and some of it edible. everything is home cooked but we normally cook everything from scratch anyway. Entertainment and Leisure I have to say we are pretty boring. I always ask myself every year, when we go on holiday, we are we going? I love staying at home. If the weather is nice I will sit out in the garden with a cold beer, a good book and while away the hours that way. It has been almost enjoyable. Routine has been very important. At Christmas I took delivery of a piano. It was free but it was in a hell of a state. I was looking forward to playing it but just before lockdown my wife was fiddling around with the insides and broke a lot of the little straps. So essentially for the last ten weeks I have been completely renovating and 80 year old piano. I do a little bit each day and we are very nearly there. I have also learnt an awful lot about how pianos work. It has also tested my patience somewhat and this is when I missed the opportunity to go for my long walks. I am very glad to now be able to go for long walks. I have also been writing, just a little book and we shall see where that goes. I have been learning Spanish using Duolingo, Babbel and a lot of reading Spanish. I have also been memorising poems which are just about keeping my mind occupied. Personal Hygiene I am not quite sure what this question could possibly be aiming at!! I can’t say my regime on a daily basis changes at all. This is the same even if I am on holiday. However on holiday I may get lazy and not shave. I can usually last about 4 weeks before it starts turning into a beard and then gets all scruffy and I have to shave it off. However, for once in my life I have actually gone to some trouble, if only to stop the boredom. I have grown a sort of ‘Van Dyck’ beard with a bit of a twirly moustache and a long pointy sort of beard around the chin accompanied with pointy sideburns. I thought that if no-one was actually going to see me then why not. My wife likes it and very recently she bought a pot of sculpting wax. Ridiculous but it does small very nice. I think I look a little like Velasquez but the beard is so grey and ageing. I am not sure if I will keep it. I’ll keep it for now. Sleep I am sorry to have to report but I really do get a great nights sleep every night. I tend to go to bed at 11, listen to comedy on radio 4 extra until about 12 or read and then wake at about 7.30 to 8. The children tend to do their own thing in the morning and I let them have their space. I have had some interesting dreams but they have had nothing to do with Covid19 (that I can think of!) – One dream I had the other night was that I bought a very nice house but inside there were very few windows and lots of long corridors. The corridors tended to slope downwards and there was a lot of Laura Ashley wallpaper. There were bare bulbs burning bright and very high skirting boards. A female friend of mine was there and she was dress in a sort of frilly Shirley temple outfit riding a tiny tricycle down these corridors. Outside the house we were directly on the seafront almost in the middle of the dodgems!! Bizarre but very nice feeling on waking."

Mass-Observer P5940 describes themself as female; age 49; married; business consultant.;The Directive 'Everyday Health and Wellbeing' was issued on 27 November 2020 and asked Mass-Observers about their opinions on and experiences of health and wellbeing, in particular 'health, wellbeing and the healthy body'; 'identity'; 'growing up and learning about health and wellbeing'; 'growing older'; 'health, wellbeing and appearance'; 'getting ready to leave the house'.","P5940: female, 49, married, York, Business Consultant Part 2: Everyday Health and Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body For me, health means if you have issues or illnesses that you need to be treated for. Wellbeing is a more holistic term which takes into consideration all of your illnesses – mental and physical – and looks at treatments that can include things like healthy eating, connecting with others, learning, being mindful etc. What do you think about when you imagine “a healthy body”? Please share the first five words that come to your mind when you think of this term. Water, vegetables, walking, nature, air Is there a particular person or image that comes to mind? Please describe, or draw, this person. Joe Wicks! But also, people like Emma Mitchell who share their mental health challenges but use nature to overcome them. Identity I grew up in the 70s with a mother who was interested in alternative approaches to wellbeing and that has rubbed off on me – being an educated woman, raised as I was, I’m interested in wellbeing and have tried many different approaches to healthy living. I think it’s probably easier for women to be open about trying new approaches to wellbeing. Wellbeing is discussed so much in relation to family, menopause etc. It’s always seen as being integral to whichever stage of your life you’re at, I think. I am a person who likes trying new things and this certainly drives me to try different approaches to mental and physical wellbeing. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I learnt from an early age as my mother was interested in being healthy, not eating processed food etc. I had a lot of allergies as a child and so we avoided eating artificial additives and processed foods. We’ve always been keen to get out of the house and I made the link with ‘doing’ and ‘feeling better’ from an early age. My mother and I talked about eating healthily and getting plenty of fresh air. At primary school, I remember talking about how much sugar was in foods and that wasn’t good for us. I certainly read magazines when I was a child/teenager but often the articles were about how to look better/be thin through healthy eating. Latterly, I read newspapers or watch the news for information about health and wellbeing. My workplace is very focussed on wellbeing and there are lots of resources and classes we can access to support wellbeing. It’s very different from 5 or 10 years ago when you probably would have found this information in specialist magazines. Key moments When I was about 10 or 11, my body started to change. My periods started, I became spotty and my body shape changed. I don’t think I thought these stages were important – maybe I was bit embarrassed about the changes?  Growing older I have always eaten healthily, drunk a lot of water, spent a lot of time outside but I was never very sporty – although I always liked swimming. I swam a lot and when I became forty, I trained for triathlons, I think that is when I started taking my fitness more seriously. Now, I exercise at least three times a week, normally I would be swimming twice a week as well. I also meditate three times a week and walk as much as I can. I spend time learning and P5940 connecting with family and friends. I write as I think that contributes to wellbeing too. I get information about wellbeing from friends, the media – probably the Guardian – and from various forums, like the Menopause Forum. I’ve had to be more aware of my body over the past 5-10 years as I’ve suffered very badly with the menopause. It’s only in the last year, after seeing a specialist, that I’ve really been able to feel like I have more control over my wellbeing. Health, wellbeing and appearance I think that, growing up in the 80s, everything -for a woman – was about how you looked, your body shape etc. I worried all the time about being fat, being wrinkly, spotty etc. It was such a waste of time. Now, I think there’s a focus on wellbeing and then, hopefully, your looks and appearance will follow and will improve. In the past, I have been drawn into fads about ‘clean eating’ but these seem too obsessed with weight loss and looks and so now I take a more measure view of health and wellbeing. I think my Mum has never been influenced by ideals although other members of my family were very influenced and ate little, focussed on looks obsessively, to the point of becoming unhealthy. Years ago, I started making my own skin care items and use oils and essential oils to moisturise my skin. If I had to go to a desert island, I would take a big flask of some baobab and rosehip oil with petitgrain and Melissa oils! Getting ready to leave the house. My mum had a very quick routine, nothing extravagant. My grandmothers both were obsessed with looks and beauty and spent a lot of time and money on skin care and clothes. One of my grandmothers had beautiful, fine skin – like porcelain – she wouldn’t go out in the sun. It was unlined and clear until she died. I have worn makeup since I was a teenager. My routine really hasn’t changed a lot. I shower every day, moisturise my body with (homemade) oil. Put on makeup then leave my hair a while and then dry it. I probably use less products than I used to – I try to get ready as quickly as I can now, I don’t spend a lot of time massaging my skin or putting on eye cream. None of it makes a difference anyway."

It seems to me that pretty much any project from any field or discipline can claim to positively impact on health and wellbeing! To me, ‘health’ is a straight-forward term that relates to health of the body. So, I guess I see this as pretty medical, but one that includes preventative measures – such as regular exercise – as well as more traditional medical approaches. I see ‘wellbeing’ as a much broader term, that includes things like mental or emotional wellbeing, environmental factors that affect mental or emotional states, social and creative inputs – basically all the stuff that makes people happy and makes living comfortable or even pleasurable. When I think of a healthy body, I guess the main thing I think about is balance – not too fat, not too thin, not to muscular, not too flabby, sun kissed, but not too tanned. I think extremes of fitness can be as unhealthy as extreme unfitness. I don’t spend a lot of time imagining healthy bodies, but I guess now I’m thinking about it a yoga teacher kind of physique springs to mind. Someone who is strong and fit but not necessarily there showing off their six pack. I think my attitude to health has largely been formed by my mum. She was a nurse, and as a kid we always had home cooked food, we always ate plenty of vegetables and we weren’t allowed things like fizzy drinks or Findas crispy pancakes in the house. Which always really upset me as a kid! We weren’t deprived all treats though. I usually had a penguin chocolate bar or similar in my lunch box every day, we always had pudding after dinner and chocolate bars on Friday nights. When I left home, I then tended to cook in the same way and me and my husband still do. We rarely have processed or pre-packaged food and make most things from scratch. I guess social class might have something to do with it, but in a round-about way. I suspect, after my dad died and as a single parent to two young children, home-cooked meals were cheaper than ready-made meals in the 1980s. But my mum and grandparents were definitely middle class in their outlook if not their professions, so it may also have been part of an aspirational outlook? Similarly, my dad was a very active person, as is my sister – if she feels like she’s got a cold coming on, her solution is to go for a run! I think because of that, for most of my life I thought of myself as being pretty lazy. Swimming is really the only physical activity I enjoy and have, at various points been a member of gyms and swam at least two or three times a week to justify the membership fee. I haven’t really been able to do that since having children as there just aren’t the hours in the day – but I figured that was ok because I get my exercise from my 20min bike ride each way to work four or five days a week. It was only in the last year or two that I realised no one else thought I was lazy and that, out of a group of 6 friends, only two of us regularly did any form of exercise. In terms of being conscious about my own health and wellbeing, I honestly don’t know when I first started thinking about and taking responsibility for it. I come from a relatively healthy family and learnt about cooking and nutrition at school. I guess the first real introduction to the idea of health and wellbeing was through my stepdad. He had bad knee joints when I was younger, and he went on the Hay System which talked about not mixing carbohydrates and proteins in the same meal. So that made me think for the first time about what nutritionally went on my plate. He also then started looking into some posture and wellbeing thing that was popular at the time – the something Method – I can’t remember, but that took a more holistic approach to health. And I think it did all solve his Autumn Directive 2020 S4002 Female, 42 Married, Cardiff Manager knee problem as he doesn’t have it now! My family aren’t hippies by any stretch, but at some point, all of us have tried things like acupuncture, massage and other forms of alternative therapies, so I guess we all believe that wellbeing is an important part of health. And all of that has just informed where I am now. In terms of key moments, I guess the one I remember most is starting to wear a crop top. It happened shortly after I'd been in hospital with an asthma attack, so the rib cage area was generally uncomfortable at the time. I was in primary school, so maybe 10 at the time. I had my first period on the 1st January 1990 – a memorable date rather than a memorable experience. At the age of 12, moving into a new decade was a really big deal. When I got my period, I just went and got the free sanitary towels we’d been given at school and then told my mum. It wasn’t really a big deal to me then and I wasn’t that happy about puberty. At the time, I didn’t really want to change and saw it as a real chore and inconvenience. A more memorable moment for me – well significant – was when I was probably somewhere around 20 give or take a couple of years, and when I realised that my body would never stop changing. It’s kind of talked about like you go through puberty at like 14 or something and then that's it. But it isn’t. My body has continued to change and some of that is down to hormones and not diet. With that realisation, I felt a bit freer but also a bit pissed off that I wasn’t properly informed. Instead, we’re kind of made to feel bad about our bodies changing is negative and to do with ageing or ‘filling out’ when it’s something we literally have no control over. But I think we live in a society that likes to think it has control over a lot of things we don’t – just look at responses to Covid-19. Another key moment for me was when I stopped taking the pill. In my early 20s I swapped to a coil and felt like a totally different person. I became much more aware of my body and more in tune with its cues. Emotionally, I suddenly felt reconnected with my body. It’s difficult to describe, but it felt a bit like I hadn’t realised my head was floating a couple of inches above my body and when I stopped taking the pill, the two reconnected. I think I became more of a whole person for it and more stable emotionally, which in turn, made me feel more confident making decisions and trusting my judgement. Part of me did (and does) think the pill is part of the patriarchy’s way of keeping women under control! At the moment, I am more aware of my body than ever. I have a 5 month old baby, so I am amazed by my body’s ability to grow, give life to and sustain another human being, for the second time. It is an incredibly empowering feeling and I don’t think I will ever doubt my body’s ability to do anything. As I am exclusively breastfeeding a very hungry little baby, it makes me very aware of my body’s own functions, from the feeling in my breasts when it’s time for a feed, to the feeling in my limbs and lack of concentration when I haven’t eaten or drank enough during the day. It makes me acutely aware that the human body is a finely balance machine that needs to be looked after. Unfortunately, because I my lack of sleep, my diet is terrible at the moment. I can’t stop eating and craving utter shit, like cake and biscuits. I keep trying to eat more healthily but it is always easier to snack on junk food. It is almost Christmas, so I’ll make sure my diet improves in the new year! The other thing about having a baby later in life makes you realise how knackered out you are. I don’t think there’s a part of me that doesn’t ache from all the lifting and carrying. And I am bone tired all the time. I think it's the same for all parents of young babies, but I can’t help thinking someone who is 10 years younger must bounce back faster and creak less. Autumn Directive 2020 S4002 Female, 42 Married, Cardiff Manager I have and haven’t given much thought to my future health and wellbeing. Having lost two parents, one to an accident and one to cancer, anything could get me at any time. I hope that doing Pilates will help to keep me mobile and grounded, as I find focussing on the exercises gives my mind a break from whatever is going on in my life. I hope cycling to work will help to keep me generally fit, as will running around after 2 children, so I think I’m laying some good groundwork to keep me healthy in the future. In terms of diet, I don’t think it will change that much as really, I start to feel sluggish and a bit sick if I have a week or two where I don’t eat lots of veg. I’m afraid that I am a bit of a fattist. Which is not very kind, but overweight people do make me feel uncomfortable. Not many people know that because it isn’t one of my best qualities, but I’m really bad for it. I’m not talking people who could do with losing a pound or two, I’m talking people who are really obese. Part of the reason is that I think I find it uncomfortable is that it says something about a person’s internal mind. I kind of believe in the idiom of ‘tidy house, tidy mind’ and I guess I sort of assume that if people aren’t willing to look after themselves physically and are making themselves ill (mobility issues, diabetes, etc) then it says something about their mental state. And it’s not the kind of mental state I want to get involved with. Generally, I try not to be too judgemental about people and the choices I make, but it all just falls apart a little when it comes to people who are overweight. Isn’t that awful -I don’t like it but I can’t help it. And I’ve got worse since being pregnant. Going through the physical process of carrying the extra weight and being a larger body shape is bloody hard work. I know that pregnant and overweight bodies operate differently, but just fitting behind a desk or sitting at a table is hard work when you are a larger size. Why would someone do that to themselves? In terms of my own appearance, I make a bit of an effort, but not much! My beauty routine takes about 5 minutes to complete. Put on a bit of moisturiser, whack on a bit of foundation, concealer, blusher, lipstick, eyeshadow, and mascara and I’m done. I haven’t found it difficult to keep up my beauty routine with a newborn baby because it takes me so little time to get ready! That being said, I do like to look like I’ve made a bit of an effort. Not in the sense that I dress up a lot, just that I look together. I work in an art school, but I like wearing clothes that make me feel like a professional and not a student, so personal appearance is important to me. I think I get this from my mum, who was always very concerned about how she looked and what others thought. She always looked smart, made an effort and loved to dress up for occasions. I think I was a bit of a disappointment to her on that front as she was always trying to get me into some frilly dress or other, but using clothes to project the image that you want has stayed with me. But I will go out without makeup on when I’m not working, and I don’t make that much more of an effort when I’m going on a night out-maybe put on a top that I’ve actually ironed rather than let the wrinkles fall out. In terms of desert island items, I’d probably have to go with suncream, because I burn to a crisp, and my eyelash curler, because otherwise my eyelashes irritate my eyes. I think I’m just too practical and tight-fisted for fashion!"

Fingers crossed! My emotions were very steady for the first 5 or 6 weeks, but just lately I have been experiencing some ups and downs. I realise there is nothing I can do to change the situation we are in, apart from to stay and home, go out rarely and avoid other people as much as possible.  I feel very sad that I am unable to go over to Paris (which we have been used to doing every couple of months or so) to visit our son, daughter in law and grand daughter. As time as gone on I have realised that this situation won't get much better for a long time, and find the prospect of not seeing our grand daughter (who was 2 at Christmas and is growing up very quickly and at a very interesting stage) or “normal” life returning for a very long time rather depressing.  However, I manage to talk myself out of that, as there is no point in getting low.  My main emotion is anger at the way the government is mis-managing the whole situation. The Government I'm afraid many of my thoughts on the political decisions that have been made are unprintable! However, I'll give it a go: The government was very arrogant at the beginning, refusing to take any notice of the growing pandemic. They were so caught up with Brexit, going it alone and with the Brexit narrative of “Unleashing Britain's Potential”, they refused to listen to warnings or to take advantage of offers of help from the EU. Johnson missed several COBRA meetings, taking lengthy breaks at his country home, and then, after boasting of having seen his mother on mother's day and shaking hands with people when he visited a hospital treating Covid patients, he himself was taken ill with the virus and ended up in intensive care. His time was also taken up with finalising his divorce while preparing for the birth of his son.  He is a complete disaster as a Prime Minister and quite frankly, I despair. It seems that Boris Johnson, when he did start to take notice, took advice from Dominic Cummings (who is an unelected advisor and apparently an advocate of eugenics) which was to “take it on the chin – be prepared to lose members of our families before their time – let it rip through the population” to produce a so-called “herd immunity”. They followed this programme for two to three weeks, allowing large public gatherings like international football matches, and the Cheltenham racing programme to take place before eventually seeming to take notice and start to bring into action some plans – closing shops, pubs, clubs, restaurants and businesses urging people to stay at home, stay safe and protect the NHS.  It soon became apparent that the NHS was woefully underprepared for what was to come, particularly in the areas of PPE and testing etc. All these failures led to far more deaths than were necessary, and to us being the country with the worst death toll apart from USA. What has happened to NHS employees and the people working and living in care homes throughout the country is a total scandal, verging on criminal neglect. As to what the government will do in the coming months is anyone's guess. They have already decided to ease some of the restrictions, encouraging people to go back to work. Their new approach was announced by the PM by means of a TV speech on Sunday night. This was anti-democratic and not the way it should have been done. Any announcement should have been made in the House of Commons where it could come under proper scrutiny and the details worked out, before being shared with the public. He brought in new measures regarding going to work, without having told work places that they should start preparing themselves to provide safe working environments, and told people they should not use public transport to get to work... the whole thing was totally confusing and muddled – leading to a dangerous situation where eventually the public was just told to “use your common sense”. This, Iam sure, willlead to a further spike in the numbers of positive tests and deaths when presumably everything will be locked down again. News I watch the BBC news, read the i newspaper, The Guardian and the Observer. I also look at the BBC website, Byline Times online, The European and Twitter. I do watch the daily press briefings most days, but find them totally useless. The media seems hamstrung by the fact that they are asking questions via screens and seem unable to take the government spokesmen properly to task or interview them with any rigour at all. The questions from the public are fatuous. The spokespeople say the same things over and over and never give a straight answer to any questions.  Most of them, quite frankly seem entirely out of their depth. I have no problem getting access to the news, but I can imagine that having signing interpreters would make it easier for people with hearing problems, and should be introduced across the board. Work and Home Life I am extremely fortunate in this regard.  Being retired and a pensioner I have no need to go to work and have found that being made to stay in my home was no real hardship at all. I am missing out on my volunteer work, and other regular social events that I was used to attending regularly, but I have a comfortable home with a garden (which is a real godsend) lots of books to read, knitting and tapestry work to do; I get on very well with my husband and we've had no disagreements or problems with being together all day every day. I am very lucky. Technology This is invaluable and the whole situation would have been a lot worse without it. We are used to emailing, texting and WhatsApping our friends and family on a regular basis.  But these occasions have increased greatly. We have also learned how to use Zoom, through which I can still take part in my weekly Tai Chi lesson, have meetings with my family who are in Paris and London and meet up with friends who we've not seen for quite a long time! I don't use Facebook really, but am a great fan of Instagram and Twitter, both of which have been great for distraction and education. Shopping and food This has been slightly challenging, though we've not been as badly affected as some people, because I always keep a big stock of food etc as a general habit, and was particularly well stocked this year because we'd recently bought a chest freezer and filled it as a way of stock piling in advance of a no-deal Brexit which my husband was sure would happen and would lead to various shortages. We have a small M&S Simply Food shop in Warwick, which has been very well stocked with most things and is well organised as far as social distancing is concerned so I have been popping in there every now and then. Otherwise I have had vegetables delivered from one of the Warwick market stalls, and had deliveries from a small deli in town.  Now I have finally managed to work the Waitrose click and collect slot system and will be collecting my second big grocery shop this weekend! Our eating habits haven't changed greatly but I seem to be thinking much more about what I will cook each day and whether I've got the necessary ingredients. We are, however, drinking more wine – particularly as each evening comes we are left despairing by the news or the government briefing, and the only solution seems to be to have a glass or more of wine! Entertainment and Leisure I'm afraid I have been pretty idle during the lockdown so far. I haven't learned any new skills, but have been doing things I normally do to a greater or lesser degree, such as knitting and tapestry. At the beginning I found it hard to concentrate enough to read (very frustrating as I am usually a great reader) but now I find the habit is returning and I have been able to take pleasure in reading again. A particular favourite book has been the latest biography of the Beatles “One Two Three Four The Beatles in Time” by Craig Brown. It is a fascinating overview of the 60s decade and the Beatles part in it. We haven't done much film or tv watching of any particular note, apart from two films starring Jeff Bridges, both of which we've seen before but which we thoroughly enjoyed ­“Come Hell or HighWater” and the remake of “True Grit”. I have watched one or two art programmes on iPlayer such as a BBC programme which Michael Palin made on the Danish painter Hammershoi.  I have been continuing to listen to my favourite pod casts, the ones I have enjoyed most are “Older and Wider” with Jenny Eclair and Judith Holder, “Fortunately” with Jane Garvey and Fi Glover and “Backlisted” the books podcast by John Mitchinson and Andy Miller. I find podcasts particularly helpful in bed at night. We have been doing a couple of jigsaws and have been sowing seeds and plants and raising seedlings for a vegetable garden. I have been doing some exercise most days – but probably not enough. I walk round town for half an hour or so about 5 days out of 7. Personal Hygiene My habits regarding this haven't really changed. I tend to stay longer in bed in the morning than I would have done before, and sometimes don't change out of my night clothes until late morning, after a shower, but I have continued to wear makeup most days and attempt to make my hair look ok, though that is getting more and more difficult since I cannot get to a hair dresser to have my hair cut! This is going to be more and more distressing as the time goes on, I'm sure – but there's no alternative other than getting my husband to cut it, which I really don't fancy! Sleep My sleep, surprisingly, hasn't been too badly affected by the situation.  In fact, generally speaking I think I'm sleeping a bit better than usual.  I have had a couple of nights which were filled with nightmares, which I found rather distressing, and which affected me during the day afterwards, but otherwise I have no real problem, so far.  If I do find it hard to get to sleep, or if I wake in the night and can't go back to sleep I tend to listen to my podcasts and find them very helpful, just to prevent my mind wandering somewhere where I don't w a n t t"

NO CHILDREN. LOCATION: BORDON, HAMPSHIRE OCCUPATION: GLOBAL BID MANAGER FOR A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY Autumn Directive 2020 Part 2 – Everyday Health & Wellbeing Health, wellbeing and the healthy body “Health” means to me more of a medical term. So everything in the body is functioning as it should. “Wellbeing” is more of a spiritual term, incorporating the brain and the other senses of the body. A healthy body in 5 words: . Supple . Fruit . Vegetables . Slim . Active Gwyneth Paltrow springs to mind when I consider a healthy person. Identity I grew up in the 1980s, where we lived a reasonable comfortable middle-class existence in a suburban town. There was always food on the table, mainly home cooked. We didn’t indulge much in biscuits and puddings. We weren’t particularly into fad foods. My experience of health has been influenced by social class and ethnicity. But I can’t say it is has been influenced particularly by gender or sexual orientation. Growing up and learning about health and wellbeing I first became aware of health around the time of secondary school. But wellbeing was a bit later, perhaps not until in my twenties. It seems to be everywhere now, but wellbeing was a relatively new term for me. My parents had responsibility for looking after my health when I was a child. Mainly my mother. She cooked the meals. And we had a balanced diet. I don’t recall being a fussy eater. I went through a brief stage of being a vegetarian when I was about 13, but Mum just served me the potatoes and vegetables. She didn’t buy vegetarian foods for me. I quickly got bored and went back to a normal diet. But that wasn’t for health reasons. I think I just wanted to be different. SEX: FEMALE AGE: 40 STATUS: MARRIED, ALTHOUGH LIVING ALONE AS HUSBAND CURRENTLY IN PRISON. NO CHILDREN. LOCATION: BORDON, HAMPSHIRE OCCUPATION: GLOBAL BID MANAGER FOR A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY It wasn’t until I was about 14 that I was diagnosed with a glucose intolerance. My sugar levels would crash constantly, leaving me sweating, weak and shaky. I realised that I couldn’t eat chocolate and sweet things, only in moderation after a meal. So from there, and to this day, I rarely touch sweet things. I don’t have a sweet tooth. My parents attitude to diet was reasonably healthy. I can remember my Mum being shocked to hear that my Dad grew up on meals (during the early 1950s) such as white bread sandwiches with Mars Bars. My maternal Grandma too used to love sugar sandwiches. And I think my Mum from a young age had a much healthier approach to food than her own parents. Perhaps influenced by magazines of the time. She insisted on only eating brown bread for instance. I remember when Mum switched us all to skimmed milk – we thought it was horrible and watery, but we got used to it begrudgingly. Key moments Breasts and periods were definitely key moments in growing up. I first become aware of adolescence when I was about 10. Two very hard lumps appeared on my chest. I told my Mum and she took me to the GP and she said it was the breasts forming and it was perfectly normal. I think we were a bit shocked and embarrassed, as looking back now it was obvious what they were! I started wearing crop tops because all the other girls at school did, you could wear cool, different patterned ones. It was clear I was more advanced in the breast department than some and I needed more ‘support’. Mum went out and bought me my first bra from Tammy Girl. AA. It was non-underwired and nylon, and it was so itchy. I was upset because I wanted to wear the crop tops like the other girls as they had better patterns on them. I didn’t want the boys to see I had a bra on under my school shirt in case I got teased. I remember she told my Dad (by this time they were separated). He tried to bring it up with me in McDonalds, said something like “You’re a woman now…” and I almost died of embarrassment. I started my periods at 11. I remember my Mum was out for the evening. We had a babysitter but I didn’t want to tell her. I left a note in my Mums bedroom for when she got home. It said “Mum I’ve started by Ps. Please get me some things”. When she got home, she crept into my room to talk to me, but I pretended to be asleep. I was too embarrassed to discuss it. But she did buy me some things. SEX: FEMALE AGE: 40 STATUS: MARRIED, ALTHOUGH LIVING ALONE AS HUSBAND CURRENTLY IN PRISON. NO CHILDREN. LOCATION: BORDON, HAMPSHIRE OCCUPATION: GLOBAL BID MANAGER FOR A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY My sister didn’t start her periods until she was 14. And I remember being very unkind to her because I thought she was a late developer compared to me. And I was therefore far more “wordly wise” than she was. Growing older Over the last 10 years, I have seen my weight creep up to around 10 stone. I’m 5’ 1. So this is considered overweight. I’m usually a size 10 trousers and a size 12 top. And my clothes still fit me, but some are a bit tight now and I don’t wear them for that reason. I have never done any form of exercise. But I started running 2.5 years ago. I joined a running club with a friend and started Couch to 5K. I did it in 12 weeks, although I found it tough as I was so unfit. My husband had just been sent to prison, and my options for coping were: a) Sit around and mope. b) Find religion c) Start running So I chose option C. I was doing fairly well and even considered a 10K, until I fell over and smacked both knees on the pavement. Weeks of bruising meant my running fell behind. So then I joined yoga and did that for a year before Covid-19 came along and put a stop to most classes. I could have continued online but I don’t have much space in my house to do it. I started running again about 6 months ago, but lost the impetus after a few weeks. Since then I’ve done nothing. And now it’s the start of 2021, I’m into a new year and I’m wondering what I’ll do as currently all the gyms in my area are closed. Maybe I’ll try again with my running. I’m much more aware of my body now. About what goes in. I try to eat fruit and vegetables every day, and like my Mum, I only buy wholemeal bread. I don’t care so much about being slim, but I do want to remain healthy. I lost a friend to cancer a couple of years ago, she was only 41. And another friend of mine has recently recovered from bowel cancer. So you to tend to be more conscious of what you put your body through. I haven’t stopped drinking alcohol, and I’ve been known to drink a bottle of wine a night, but I’m aware that its not healthy and I would like to cut back. In future years, I expect to be even more careful with what I eat and drink. Health, wellbeing and appearance SEX: FEMALE AGE: 40 STATUS: MARRIED, ALTHOUGH LIVING ALONE AS HUSBAND CURRENTLY IN PRISON. NO CHILDREN. LOCATION: BORDON, HAMPSHIRE OCCUPATION: GLOBAL BID MANAGER FOR A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY For me, good skin is an indicator of health in a person. I’m lucky I have always had clear skin, although I have developed melasma since my late 30s which I can conceal. I was influenced quite heavily by magazines such as Just Seventeen, which used images of young, thin, tall models. When I tried to emulate the same look, I didn’t understand why things didn’t look that good on me and I would feel down about myself. I know my Mum was very influenced by beauty and make-up. I asked her recently what influenced her and she said she remembered getting the bus to school (Ashford Grammar School), with her hockey stick and frumpy school uniform. She remembers seeing these ladies get on the bus to go to work and they were immaculately dressed. She remembers studying their make-up, their eye liner and wanted to be just like them. She was a big fan of magazines like Mandy in the early 1970s when she was growing up and she put a lot of importance on how she looked. She still does to this day, wouldn’t leave the house without make-up but I don’t remember her trying to teach my sister or I. And we weren’t that interested in learning either. The one thing I couldn’t live without is a moisturiser with a good SPF in it. Getting ready to leave the house Before she went to work (as An Executive PA), my Mum would get up at 6am just to do her hair and make-up. I never understood why she didn’t want to spend the extra time in bed. But she genuinely enjoyed doing her and make-up. She always looked immaculate with her hair done with a hot brush, her make-up done expertly and painted nails. My Dad too was a stylish man, they look quite the pair when they were first married. Mum even won a beauty parade whilst she was on holiday, she was pregnant with her third child at the time. She would spend her evenings in front of the TV, filing and painting her nails. I don’t think I own a nail file. I’ve never done had the inclination to do that, my nails just chip or break. She still takes a lot of pride in her appearance to this day. Always immaculately made-up when she goes out. Recently she told me she cried because she’d run out of hair mousse and she was going to a party and all the shops were closed! I have never spent much time on my appearance, I like to look nice but I don’t spend hours doing it. I didn’t really wear make-up until I was in my late 20s. And I’ve never styled my hair to any great degree. Although I invested in a pair of GHD Hair Straighteners a year or so ago. Over the last few years I’ve been losing a lot of my hair, probably due to stress. Or low iron. So, I’m trying to take vitamins to help with that.

LOCATION: BORDON, HAMPSHIRE OCCUPATION: GLOBAL BID MANAGER FOR A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY For work, in normal times I would spend about 20 minutes doing my hair and make-up before leaving the house. Foundation, concealer, blusher, mascara. I would only bother with eye shadow and lip gloss if I was going out for the evening. Now I’m working from home due to Covid, I only put make-up on if I have video conference calls. Often I just use foundation and blusher, so I barely spend my 5 minutes doing it. And as no one is going out at the moment, I hardly ever get to wear a full face of make-up. *End*"

I’ve always tended to think of health as being a physical thing, and wellbeing more a psychological thing, to do with happiness and ability to cope with life.  I have more recently come to realise that the physical and psychological are inextricably linked and heavily depend upon each other – physical exercise can be tremendously helpful when battling mental and physical health problems, but the same problems make it very difficult to find the motivation or energy for it. My ideas about health have also been influenced by working in a job that involves reading hospital patients’ medical notes, which have taught me what a very specific balance of systems is required to maintain a healthy body and mind, and surprised at just how many inpatients have suffered from psychological problems long-term, especially anxiety and depression, and require medication and counselling for them. I don’t think I can cover a healthybody in five words, but maybe I can have a go in five phrases: Well-maintained systems such as clear lungs and blood vessels Ideal balance of chemicals such as hormones, vitamins and minerals Right balance of muscle, fat and other components A musculoskeletal frame all of which is frequently exercised (dependent on the person’s abilities) A hygienic body and environment When I think of a healthy person, I think of someone who is strong enough to carry out every daily activities (perhaps cleaning, cooking and dressing) without tiring too quickly, with a mid-range Body Mass Index (proportion of weight to height) – somewhere between lean (not skinny) and a little bulky (but not too much), who exercises most days, including working out at the gym if they can’t achieve it through walking, cycling, dancing, playing sport or even vigorous chores such as cleaning. They are largely, if not entirely, vegetarian or vegan, and don’t eat much in the way of sugary, fatty or processed foods.  They don’t smoke, or take any other recreational drugs, or drink much alcohol.  They are able to cope with most of the things life throws at them, and are not overwhelmed for too long before they bounce back and manage to get on with things. Identity I can’t thinkof many examples of how my health or wellbeing is influenced by my identity. I was born and bred in the UK, so I am very lucky to have always had access to the NHS, which is fantastic, and the best way to provide healthcare, and apart from waiting lists in some areas, which are usually down to lack of funding (and of course, recently, COVID), I believe they easily match the medical care given in private hospitals, especially for more serious illnesses and treatments.  A large part of who I am and what I do, in the last couple of years, has been strongly guided by anxiety, so I have some experience of what NHS has to offer in mental health. Working in a hospital, and a lot of the anxiety being linked to my work, I was lucky enough, just before COVID struck, to be able to access a therapist from the Psychology department, and was offered about 6 sessions which mainly focused on learning mindfulness techniques.  Around the time I finished those, I had also finally reached the top of a waiting list (which took 8 months, but I gather that it’s not uncommon for under-16s to have to wait much longer) for six Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions (by phone, because of COVID) offered by the Local Health Authority. CBT was the only treatment they offered for anxiety, although they said that if my main problem had been depression they would have been able to offer counselling, which would have allowed me to talk things through, and would have been less dependent on symptom management techniques. Although mindfulness and CBT have helped, to a certain extent, the exercises also had the effect of overloading me with even more with stuff to do, and didn’t remove the chaos from my brain, and I only turned the corner and managed to focus on my work more effectively once I started mild anti-anxiety medication (suggested by my manager, not a therapist). The therapist then told me that such medication can help with CBT, helping a person to focus on their new coping strategies. I realise that the hospital and local health authority can’t afford endless sessions of therapy for everyone who wants it, and that their treatments need to be measurable, recordable and accountable, which is why the patient is taught coping mechanisms rather than just chuntering on for weeks about how and why and their own way forward etc., which would be less likely to show tangible results, so in this one area, I might seek out a private therapist to help with the scribble in my brain. Growing up and learning about health and well-being I can’t remember anything about health education at school except for a talk for the girls, when I was 10 or 11, which may have covered puberty generally, but all I can remember was the bit intended to prepare us for the onset of periods.  We weren’t taught about the value of hygiene, nutrition or exercise, even as part of P.E. or domestic science (which mostly seemed to involve baking cakes), at any stage of school, as far as I can remember. I don’t think I remember my parents talking to me about health, although they certainly led by example, with balanced meals, clean house, clothes and family members, and encouragement of physical exercise, like walking, or participating in sports. It has taken me many years to take responsibility for my own health, and am very lucky that my lack of exercise, especially in the last couple of years (desk job), and a lifetime of unhealthy snacks haven’t, so far, resulted inany major illness (that I’m aware of –I can’t see myarteries or the state of my digestive system). Until the last few years I hadn’t looked for information about health, and all I can remember in the media, as a young adult, was advice against smoking, but now there is a wealth of advice to be seen on the Internet and television, in magazines and newspapers, as well as hundreds of books, on different aspects of health, and there now seems little excuse for anyone with access to these sources to claim ignorance of the importance of a healthy lifestyle.  A significant proportion of patients that I code suffer from heart, lung or liver disease – often avoidable conditions (though of course there will be exceptions, like genetic conditions) if people eat sensibly, exercise, avoid smoking and excessive alcohol. Sometimes a family history of heart conditions is mentioned in a patient’s notes, but in some cases, not all, it may be a result of a family history of poor diet. Key moments I can’t remember much about bodily changes at puberty.  I don’t remember my first bra, or my first period, but I remember the pain of periods, and how awful it was to be at school when they made me feel so ill. I also remember the awkwardness of tampons and early attempts at following the instructions and illustrations. Don’t laugh unless you’ve tried it! Growing older It’s only in the last couple of years that I’ve made much of an effort with my health, partly because so much of what I read in patient notes acts as a health warning – heart disease has such a negative impact on people’s lives, if it doesn’t kill them.  Also partly because I sit at a desk and don’t get much exercise, and feel out of breath after shorter bursts of physical exercise, and partly because of increased anxiety and depression. I now make sure I have a certain amount of fruit (apples ready cut up –the brownness doesn’t affect the taste – and grapes at the ready), nuts and vegetables every day.  This has become easier, since starting to work on this response, because I finally made the decision not to even buy any chocolate or crisps –it’s so easy to snack on the wrong things, working from home, in a job that’s not ideal for me. I desperately miss crisps – rice/corn cakes are OK but just not the same.  The chocolate bars I bought were very small, but it was difficult to have just the one.  I do have some Rich Tea biscuits if I get a real yen for something sweet, and they are quite enjoyable but neither they, nor the rice/corn cakes, call to me very often, which is good. My attempt to improve my diet is not just about body weight, or being pre-diabetic, or clogged arteries, but because the right intake, along with exercise, seem to make a huge difference to my energy levels and state of mind the next day. This isn’t because I know the theory and expect it –it’s actually taken me years to realise that I feel absolutely drained and fuzzy-headed the day after I have had sugary foods or missed out my fruit, nuts, vegetables or water intake. Within the last three years, I have struggled with routinely getting exercise.  I stopped going for daily 20-minute walks because I wanted to get a bit more work done, and putting music on before work in order to so-called dance for 20 minutes because although sometimes it’s enjoyable, and I still occasionally do that, sometimes I just feel a bit stupid, especially if I feel particularly tired or low. After lockdown I would like to find something like a local aerobics class, and even better if I find someone to go with, but they’re usuallyat times that don’t suit me – either during work hours, or mid-evening (I have quite an early night). I really enjoyed a regular Zumba class held at the hospital for a while, a few years back, but the instructor stopped it (because she couldn’t rely on enough staff attending regularly, what with shift patterns).  Now, I’m pleased to say, I made the decision to have a 20-minute every lunchtime regardless of how my work is going, on the basis that it will help me feel better for work the next day, and it helps enormously that usually my partner comes too, as it fits into his schedule.  I usually look for health information online these days, though I feel I know the general principles involved, because this sort of information has been pushed (and it’s welcome) at us for severalyears now.  Health, wellbeing, appearance Popular ideals of beauty have often been linked to the image of a healthy body, but also an exaggerated image of a healthy body, which can make people obsess about certain aspects of their appearance.  I have said, above, that a medium build (healthy proportions of muscle and fat) tends to indicate a healthier body than an underweight (which suggests under-or malnourishment) or overweight build.  However, because of the media persistently showing “perfect” (slim) bodies, going to the extent of airbrushing them, and companies trying to sell beauty or health products, people who are insecure worry far too much about being thin, to an unhealthy extent.  A clear skin, smooth and hydrated, suggests cleanliness and good nourishment, but this is so ingrained that a spot on the face (which unfortunately happens mostly in adolescence, a crucial time for developing self-confidence) can seem like a disaster, although I was lucky in this area and had fairly good skin. There is also muscle-building – again, based on the feeling that a strong-looking body is a healthy and therefore attractive body, but often, I think, becoming some people’s main focus in life, when they build themselves up into something that looks ridiculous and out of proportion, and sometimes leading to steroid addiction.  The other example that occurs to me, that illustrates how a healthy look can develop into an obsession, is a sun tan.  Paleness is often a fair-skinned person’s natural look, but it also seems to have been associated, by many, with an unhealthy, indoor lifestyle, and a tan has been associated with a healthy outdoor lifestyle, and thus perceived as attractive.  Yes, exposure to the sun gives us Vitamin D, and most of us do perceive a little colour rather than complete whiteness as suggesting an active, healthy outdoor life, but once it develops into an obsession to look brown, too much sun, especially for a fair-skinned person, very often causes skin cancer, which is clearly not good, and although people perhaps think that a skin cancer is easy to remove, it can also travel and cause metastases in less accessible parts of the body. When I was young I thought a good tan a very desirable thing to have, and I still wish that my legs would brown more easily, so I am clearly still influenced by that popular ideal of physical appearance, but now, quite apart from the fact that I know burning skin is a bad idea, I am too uncomfortable sitting in strong sun, and if I can be bothered, will use a bronzing cream for my legs rather than sunning them excessively. Neither of my parents was obsessed by sunning themselves, though it seems to have been the case for many years that most fair-skinned people would prefer a little bit of tan and would sit out in the sun for that purpose.  (It hasn’t always been that way – I think that way back in history it used to be a sign of good breeding tobe pale, as a sign that one didn’t have to work outdoors.) If, as children, my siblings and I were always around medium build, it was because we were given a healthy (and very tasty) diet, rather than because we worked hard at it in an attempt to be physically attractive.  Mum and Dad were also never what would be considered overweight or underweight, although Mum often still seems to eat slightly less of the main course than the rest of us. When I was trying to think of health or beauty products that I rely on, and thinking of the skin care and make up that so many women use daily, I struggled to think of any that were a must for me. I do shower or bathe, or at the very least have a good wash and a scrub, occasionally with exfoliating product, but I don’t have a skin care routine, unlike the majority of women seem to.  I think I’ve been spoiled in the past by having good skin, and looking young for my age, though fewer people comment on this, these days, so I should clearly be taking more care of myself, especially as I resent the speed at which old age seems to be creeping up on me.  I really should be using a moisturiser more often, at least on my face, but the only things I can think of that I use daily without fail are a face flannel, soap and underarm deodorant, and most days, a carefully chosen perfume.  Within the last 15 years I also got in the habit of wearing foundation for a while, especially on work days, because an ex-colleague noted that I go very pink if faced with a difficult situation, and he was someone who created uncomfortable situations himself, and the pinkness would spur him on to make me more flustered. But my pinkness is now slightly less of an issue, so I seldom use foundation these days. I need tweezers for the occasional surplus eyebrow or facial hair, and other depilatory products for legs. Don’t know what would be the single Desert Island product – perhaps some form of soap or antiseptic, although I get a lot of enjoyment from a lovely fragrance.  Getting ready to leave the house Leaving the house, Mum and Dad would be clean in body and attire, their clothes pressed, and I’m fairly certain there would always be aftershave and perfume (Dad and Mum respectively, obviously!) Mum would always apply a subtle and understated amount of make-up including powder and lipstick. I didn’t used to put much effort into mypresentation when I left the house, being lucky with good skin and hair, though sometimes I might have put mascara or eyeliner on, and clothes that were marginally more flattering (or I thought!) for a party, disco, or theatre, or if I was hoping to impress someone in particular.  For meeting friends in the daytime, or going to school, or shopping, I look back and realise how unflattering my shapeless t-shirts must have looked, and how little thought I gave to whether shapes or colours worked together. This was despite Mum trying to persuade me that a pretty blouse with a nice smart collar was the way to go. For many years I worked in bookshops, before there were company polo shirts with a logo, and people wore pretty much what they liked, so for me it was usually jeans and a t-shirt.  I was briefly a teacher, and of course aimed for a professional look at that time, and when I worked in a pharmacy, there was a uniform. It wasn’t until I got this office job, three years ago, that I went out and bought smart clothes, and actually made an effort to look extra nice, partly to look professional, of course, but also because I’ve started actually wanting to look good. Not sure why, maybe because it requires more effort when you’re older, than just relying on the gifts of good skin and good hair. Or it might be because I’m working on self-respect. It might also be because, with the gift of hindsight, I realise I must have looked, for years, as if I never made an effort. For this job I even made myself buy some clothes that were full price, if I thought something suited and fitted me well (although that doesn’t seem to happen very often), rather than waiting for something cheaper in sales or TKMaxx, which would generally result in finding nothing I liked. Even paying full price, there’s still not that much I like. Whilst I’m working from home, I don’t wear such smart clothes, although I’m clean and neat and not too casual, because of daily video meetings. Actually, whilst it’s cold, I often wear a fleece jacket and a scarf, which isn’t exactlyoffice wear, but the other home-working people wrap up warm, too. I seldom wear make-up these days, although I wore foundation a couple of times for work Teams meetings, and for family Zoom sessions, but now I don’t bother. I try to make my hair look normal, smooth and not too middle-aged, and occasionally, when I fail badly, I turn off the camera for work meetings – a few of us do that, and theydon’t seem to mind."
